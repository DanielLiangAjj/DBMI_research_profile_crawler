Researcher: Alexis Walker
Research Overview:
Alexis Walker's research spans a diverse array of interdisciplinary topics within biomedical research, focusing particularly on themes of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in healthcare, social justice, and the ethics of genomics. Key areas of interest include the implications of race and ethnicity on health disparities, the ethical considerations surrounding genomic research and direct-to-consumer genetics, and the social determinants of health that affect access and equity in healthcare systems. Furthermore, Walker investigates the intersection of biomedical ethics with infectious diseases such as Hepatitis C and HIV, utilizing qualitative research methods to explore patient experiences and perceptions. By examining the roles of financial resources, health care rationing, and global health initiatives in places like Guyana, Walkerâ€™s work addresses the complexities of health care delivery and highlights the vital need for responsible resource allocation within an increasingly data-driven landscape. This comprehensive approach to understanding and addressing inequities in health care underscores Walker's commitment to advancing ethical and inclusive practices in the biomedical field.
