Researcher: Molly Przeworski
Research Overview:
Molly Przeworski's research encompasses a diverse range of topics at the intersection of evolutionary biology, genetics, and genomics. Her work focuses on critical processes such as DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, meiotic recombination, and the role of genes like PRDM9 in genomic diversity across species, including humans and various vertebrates. By investigating mechanisms like gene conversion and natural selection, her research provides insights into the dynamics of germline mutations and their implications for human health, including the distribution of fitness effects and early-onset diseases linked to loss-of-function mutations. Przeworski also explores sex differences in mutation rates, the impact of maternal and paternal age, and the comparative genomics that highlight evolutionary patterns in primates. Through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and analyses of mutational spectra, her work contributes significantly to understanding genetic variation, adaptation, and the evolutionary forces shaping human genetics and population dynamics. Overall, her research advances our knowledge of how evolutionary processes influence genetic architecture and disease susceptibility in humans and other organisms.
