Researcher: Barry Honig
Research Overview:
Barry Honig's research is centered on the intricate dynamics of protein-protein interactions and the structural biology of proteins, particularly concerning their coevolution, prediction of protein complexes, and the modeling of protein structures. His work harnesses machine learning and computational biology to investigate protein dynamics, interaction specificity, and binding mechanisms across various species, including humans and model organisms like mice and Drosophila. A significant aspect of his research involves exploring adhesion proteins, such as cadherins, and their roles in neuronal self-avoidance and cell communication, alongside applications to disease relevance, notably in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. He integrates diverse techniques, including X-ray crystallography, NMR, and structural alignment to generate insights into protein structure, functionality, and interaction within biological networks. His contributions have significant implications in systems biology, virology, and drug discovery, aiming to elucidate fundamental mechanisms underlying molecular mimicry and host-pathogen interactions. Overall, Honig's comprehensive approach combines molecular modeling, biophysics, and biomedical applications to advance our understanding of protein interactions and their evolutionary implications.
