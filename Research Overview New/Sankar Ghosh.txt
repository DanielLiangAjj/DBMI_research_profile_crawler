Researcher: Sankar Ghosh
Research Overview:
Sankar Ghosh's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focused on autoimmune diseases, cancer, inflammation, and the roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in these processes. His work utilizes advanced genomic techniques such as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and RNA sequencing to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Ghosh explores the contributions of specific lncRNAs, such as LINC00173 and Lnc13, to the regulation of inflammatory pathways involving key signaling proteins like NF-kappaB and Ras proteins, as well as their implications in cancer, particularly head and neck cancers and tobacco-related diseases. His research also emphasizes the use of bioinformatics and computational methods to assess the genetic predisposition and admixture of populations, particularly in Northeast India. In addition, Ghosh investigates the interplay between lifestyle factors, genetic variants, and metabolic syndromes, shedding light on how these elements influence disease susceptibility and progression. Overall, his multifaceted research aims to refine our understanding of the immunological responses and genetic landscape in various diseases, potentially aiding in the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.
