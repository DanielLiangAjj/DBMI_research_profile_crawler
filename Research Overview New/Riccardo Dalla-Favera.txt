Researcher: Riccardo Dalla-Favera
Research Overview:
Riccardo Dalla-Favera's research primarily focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying various forms of B-cell lymphomas, particularly Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). His work extensively examines the role of genetic mutations, transcriptional networks, and immune evasion mechanisms in the pathogenesis of these malignancies. Key themes include the involvement of oncogenes such as NOTCH1, the impact of tumor suppressors like PTEN, and the effects of targeted therapies such as dasatinib. Dalla-Favera employs various experimental models, including murine models and in vitro studies, to explore how alterations in B-cell differentiation, signaling pathways, and apoptosis contribute to lymphoma development and treatment resistance. His studies contribute significantly to the understanding of genetic predispositions and the complexities of B-cell immune responses in cancer, thereby paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies and improved prognostic markers in lymphoid malignancies.
