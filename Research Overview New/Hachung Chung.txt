Researcher: Hachung Chung
Research Overview:
Hachung Chung's research primarily explores the interplay between nucleic acid sensing and neuroinflammatory processes associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. The researcher investigates the role of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including both DNA and RNA sensing mechanisms (cGAS, AIM2, TLR9, MDA5, RIG-I, PKR, TLR3, TLR7/8), in the context of innate immunity and neurodevelopment. Key themes within the research include neuroinflammation, nucleic acid immunity, A-to-I RNA editing mediated by ADAR1, and the impact of Alu elements on neural progenitor cell function. Through advanced techniques like RNA sequencing, Chung aims to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in immune responses within the brain and their contributions to the pathophysiology of neuroinflammatory diseases. Overall, Chung's work underscores the critical link between the immune system and nervous system health, highlighting potential therapeutic avenues for addressing neurodegeneration and related disorders.
