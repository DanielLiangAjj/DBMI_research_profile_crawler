Researcher: Frank Costantini
Research Overview:
Frank Costantini's research primarily focuses on the mechanisms of kidney development and branching morphogenesis. His work explores the roles of various genetic components, including receptor tyrosine kinases and specific signaling pathways (e.g., FGF receptors), in organogenesis and cellular differentiation, particularly in renal epithelium and nephrons. Utilizing advanced genetic techniques such as conditional knockout models and mosaic analysis, driven by Cre and FLP recombinases, Costantini investigates the intricate cellular movements and interactions that underlie organ formation in murine models, including transgenic and knockout mice. His research is enriched by the application of organ culture techniques and the generation of organoids, which serve as valuable platforms for studying the dynamics of kidney morphogenesis. Through the incorporation of molecular genetics, cell biology, and organ culture studies, Costantini aims to elucidate the complex processes that govern kidney formation and their implications for developmental biology and regenerative medicine.
