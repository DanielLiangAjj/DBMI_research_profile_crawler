Researcher: Arnold Han
Research Overview:
Arnold Han's research encompasses a multifaceted exploration of immunological responses, primarily focusing on the roles of various T cell and B cell subsets in both autoimmune conditions, such as Celiac Disease, and in cancer immunotherapy, particularly colorectal cancer. His work delves into the mechanistic pathways driving T cell activation, the antigen specificity of T cell receptors, and the impact of genetic predispositions, such as HLA associations, on immune disease. Han employs advanced techniques including single-cell sequencing and high-throughput TCR sequencing to characterize complex T cell repertoires and immune cell dynamics in relation to gluten exposure and tumor microenvironments. His studies contribute to a deeper understanding of immunoediting and cancer immunoediting processes, enhancing the potential for developing effective immunotherapeutic strategies. Collectively, his findings aim to shed light on the intricate interplay between immune tolerance, malignancy, and immunological memory, shaping future therapeutic approaches targeting both autoimmunity and cancer.
