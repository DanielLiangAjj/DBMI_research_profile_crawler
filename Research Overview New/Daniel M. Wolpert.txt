Researcher: Daniel M. Wolpert
Research Overview:
Daniel M. Wolpert's research focuses on the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making, motor control, and learning processes. His work utilizes computational models and neurophysiological experiments to explore how individuals adapt their behavior in response to sensory feedback and contextual cues. Central themes include Bayesian inference and the role of various brain structures such as the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum in learning, memory, and motor planning. Additionally, his studies delve into the complexities of context-dependent learning, confidence in judgment, the speed-accuracy trade-off in decision-making, and the implications of these processes in both voluntary and involuntary actions. By integrating concepts from computational neuroscience and behavioral research, his findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how the brain optimally utilizes information for action and decision-making in uncertain environments.
