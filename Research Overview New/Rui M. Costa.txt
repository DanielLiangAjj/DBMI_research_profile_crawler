Researcher: Rui M. Costa
Research Overview:
Rui M. Costa's research spans a diverse range of topics primarily in the neuroscience domain, focusing on the interplay between neurological mechanisms and behaviors. His work investigates the cognitive and emotional aspects of daydreaming, loneliness, and well-being, often linking them to mental health outcomes and interoceptive awareness. Additionally, Costa's studies delve into motor control strategies, motor learning, and the effects of dopamine in conditions such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease, showcasing the neurophysiological underpinnings of movement and decision-making processes. He also explores the psychological dimensions of sexual function and social media use, examining how these factors influence emotional states and interpersonal relationships. Through methodologies such as optogenetics, calcium imaging, and brain-machine interfaces, his research aims to decode complex behaviors and improve therapeutic strategies, particularly in understanding vulnerabilities linked to mental health, motor disorders, and addictions. Overall, his multifaceted investigations contribute significantly to the fields of neuroscience, psychology, and rehabilitation medicine, with implications for enhancing mental and physical well-being.
