Researcher: Gary Struhl
Research Overview:
Gary Struhl's research focuses on the molecular mechanisms regulating cell signaling and developmental processes, primarily using model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. His work extensively investigates the roles of various proteins, including ADAM proteases, Epsin, and components of the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, in processes such as ectodomain shedding, endocytosis, and organ size control. Struhl explores the intricate interactions among these proteins in the context of morphogen signalingâ€”specifically how bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt morphogens influence cell differentiation and tissue patterning during development. His research also delves into the regulation of gene expression, highlighting the role of transcription factors and regulatory elements in development and homeostasis. By leveraging genetic modifications and sophisticated molecular biology techniques, his studies contribute to the understanding of fundamental biological principles underlying cell communication, tissue growth, and disease susceptibility.
