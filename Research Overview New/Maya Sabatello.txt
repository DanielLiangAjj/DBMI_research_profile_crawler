Researcher: Maya Sabatello
Research Overview:
Maya Sabatello's research focuses on the ethical and practical implications of consent and participation in biomedical research, particularly concerning individuals with disabilities and marginalized populations. Her work addresses critical issues such as consent capacity, equity in healthcare, barriers to participation in research, and the return of results related to polygenic risk scores. By exploring the intersectionality of genetic research and social justice, she highlights the potential for structural injustice within the framework of precision medicine and public health. Sabatello emphasizes the importance of community engagement and cultural competence in addressing health disparities, particularly among populations affected by chronic diseases and disabilities. Her commitment to ethical research practices and inclusive healthcare models aims to empower individuals while ensuring equitable representation in scientific studies, thereby advocating for improved health policies that prioritize accessibility and justice for all. The breadth of her inquiry encompasses not only the implications of genomic technologies but also the societal factors that influence public health outcomes and individual trust in medical systems.
