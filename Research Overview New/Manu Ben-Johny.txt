Researcher: Manu Ben-Johny
Research Overview:
Manu Ben-Johny's research primarily focuses on the intricate mechanisms of ion channels, specifically sodium (NaV1.5) and calcium channels, and their roles in cardiac arrhythmias. His studies delve into the biophysical properties of these channels, examining coupled gating, ion selectivity, and the regulatory effects of calmodulin and other proteins. Employing advanced techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), flow cytometry, and molecular dynamics simulations, he investigates how mutations and phosphorylation impact channel dynamics and cardiac function. His work has implications in understanding conditions like Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome, linking molecular biophysics with clinical cardiac physiology. Ultimately, Ben-Johny's contributions provide valuable insights into the structural and functional complexities of ion channels, shedding light on their relevance in cardiac health and disease.
