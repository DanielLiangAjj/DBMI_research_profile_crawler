Researcher: Franck Polleux
Research Overview:
Franck Polleux's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationships between dendritic morphology, neuronal connectivity, and synapse development in the context of human brain evolution and physiology. His work investigates the role of human-specific genes and synaptic adhesion molecules, such as neurexins and Slit-Robo, in shaping the unique features of human neurons, particularly in regions like the hippocampus where place cells are crucial for spatial navigation. By employing a variety of experimental models, including transgenic mice and human cellular systems, Polleux explores the mechanisms of synaptic specificity and calcium dynamics that govern circuit function. His findings contribute to the understanding of neurogenesis and the molecular basis of synaptic transmission, providing insights into disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Overall, his research highlights the evolutionary aspects of neuronal structure and function, with implications for understanding both cognitive processes and neurodevelopmental diseases.
