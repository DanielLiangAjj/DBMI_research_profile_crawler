Researcher: Stavros Lomvardas
Research Overview:
Stavros Lomvardasâ€™ research primarily explores the intricate relationship between chromatin structure, gene regulation, and olfactory receptor gene expression in various animal models, particularly in mice. His work delves into the epigenetic mechanisms governing stochastic gene choice and transcriptional networks, emphasizing the roles of enhancers, transcription factors, and nuclear architecture. Key themes include the differentiation and signaling pathways in olfactory receptor neurons, implications of heterochromatin, and interchromosomal interactions that influence gene expression. Additionally, his investigations extend to the altered olfactory functions associated with conditions like COVID-19, including the phenomenon of anosmia. Through a blend of developmental biology and genomics, Lomvardas aims to elucidate how gene expression patterns contribute to sensory perception, axon guidance, and neurodevelopment, thus enhancing our understanding of genetic regulation in complex biological systems.
