Researcher: amelia averitt
Research Overview:
Amelia Averitt's research predominantly revolves around the intersection of epidemiology, health informatics, and evidence-based medicine, with a notable focus on understanding and improving treatment outcomes for various health conditions, including opioid-related and substance use disorders, as well as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Employing advanced methodologies such as machine learning and deep learning techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Averitt emphasizes the importance of reproducibility, validity, and causal inference in clinical research. Her studies critically examine the economic burden and healthcare resource utilization associated with these conditions, informed by electronic health records and observational data. By synthesizing findings from randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies, her research aims to enhance decision-making in healthcare delivery by improving communication of outcomes and fostering generalizability across diverse patient populations. Overall, Averitt's work contributes significantly to the nuanced understanding of treatment efficacy and the socio-economic factors affecting patient care in the contemporary healthcare landscape.
