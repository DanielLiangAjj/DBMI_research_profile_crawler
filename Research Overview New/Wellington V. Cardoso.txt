Researcher: Wellington V. Cardoso
Research Overview:
Wellington V. Cardoso's research focuses on the complexities of epithelial differentiation and lung development, exploring both the evolutionary biology (evo-devo) and regenerative processes across various species, including mice, humans, and snakes. His studies highlight the roles of Sox genes, Notch signaling, and key developmental pathways such as the Hippo signaling pathway, emphasizing basal cell heterogeneity and the significance of stem cells in lung repair and regenerative medicine. His work utilizes advanced techniques, including lineage tracing, organotypic cultures, and cell biology methodologies to investigate airway and alveolar differentiation, branching morphogenesis, and the dynamics of progenitor cells. Cardoso's findings have implications for understanding diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, shedding light on potential therapeutic approaches to enhance lung regeneration and repair. Overall, his research significantly contributes to the fields of developmental biology and lung tissue engineering, aiming to bridge fundamental biological insights with clinical applications in pulmonary health.
