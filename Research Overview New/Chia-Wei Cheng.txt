Researcher: Chia-Wei Cheng
Research Overview:
Dr. Chia-Wei Cheng's research focuses on the intricate interplay between stem cell metabolism and cell fate decisions in various biological contexts, particularly involving the Notch signaling pathway and its role in organoid development. Utilizing advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and ChIP-seq, the studies delve into the metabolic adaptations of stem cells, especially under conditions of dietary restriction, fasting, and aging, highlighting the significance of ketone bodies and fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, the research explores the implications of calcium signaling in stem cell function and differentiation, with potential applications in understanding nephrolithiasis and vascular calcification. By integrating proteomics and metabolomics, Dr. Cheng aims to elucidate the metabolic networks that govern stem cell behavior and their responses to environmental cues, thereby contributing to the broader knowledge of cellular differentiation and the underlying mechanisms of various diseases, including diabetes and cancer.
