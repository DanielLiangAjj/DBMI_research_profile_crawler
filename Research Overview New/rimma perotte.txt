Research Overview:
Rimma Perotte's research primarily centers on critical issues within the field of kidney transplantation and health policy, particularly in the context of allograft outcomes and organ allocation. Her work examines the complexities surrounding decision-making in the allocation of organs from deceased donors, highlighting the challenges of utilizing marginal organs and the factors contributing to allograft failure. The influence of external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on transplant outcomes and patient safety is a significant focus, alongside the importance of infection control measures, particularly regarding catheter-related infections. Additionally, her exploration of health informatics, particularly the role of electronic health records, emphasizes the need for enhanced documentation practices to inform health care quality and efficiency. By analyzing waitlist dynamics and retention of organs amidst evolving health policies, Perotte contributes valuable insights to improve patient outcomes in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) management, ultimately advocating for informed decision-making in organ utilization and addressing the social and medical challenges faced by patients and health care systems alike.
