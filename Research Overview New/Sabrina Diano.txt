Researcher: Sabrina Diano
Research Overview:
Sabrina Diano's research intricately explores the interplay between central nervous system mechanisms and metabolic regulation, particularly in the context of diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders. Focusing on the hypothalamus—a crucial brain region for energy homeostasis—her work investigates the role of various neuronal and glial cell types, including pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and astrocytes, in mediating feeding behavior and metabolism. Through examining mitochondrial dynamics, specifically mitochondrial fission and respiration, Diano elucidates the bioenergetic changes that accompany obesity. Her studies emphasize the significance of neuropeptides, including melanocortin receptors and neuropeptide Y, in metabolic signaling pathways, stress responses, and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, she delves into the molecular underpinnings of glucose sensing and the effects of obesity on neurotransmitter systems and neuroinflammation. Overall, Diano's research contributes to a deeper understanding of how hypothalamic circuits regulate metabolism and behavior, offering potential insights for therapeutic strategies against obesity and associated disorders.
