Researcher: shalmali joshi
Research Overview:
Shalmali Joshi's research integrates various domains such as brain stimulation techniques, specifically focusing on Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), with cutting-edge applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare. Her work emphasizes the significance of cortical hyperexcitability in the context of motor function and plasticity, utilizing metrics like Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) to assess muscle function. Joshi also studies healthcare delivery systems, advocating for improvements in patient safety and quality of care through probabilistic modeling and statistical algorithms. She aims to address healthcare disparities and enhance health equity by incorporating social determinants of health into her research framework. Ultimately, her contributions aim to refine clinical decision-making processes, ensuring that advances in technology and health facilities translate into better patient outcomes and systemic bias reduction.
