Researcher: Joanna Smeeton
Research Overview:
Joanna Smeeton's research focuses on the mechanisms of cartilage development, regeneration, and pathology, particularly in the context of osteoarthritis. Utilizing zebrafish as a model organism, her work explores the role of chondrocytes, joint formation, and the genetic factors, such as Nkx3.2 and prg4, that influence skeletal remodeling and developmental plasticity. Her studies incorporate advanced techniques like CRISPR and RNA-Seq to investigate gene expression and cellular behaviors during joint and kidney development, providing insights into evolutionary biology and the cellular processes governing bone and cartilage integrity. By examining the interactions of various transcription factors and signaling pathways, including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, she aims to uncover therapeutic targets for improving joint health and regenerative capabilities. Overall, Smeeton's contributions enhance our understanding of cartilage biology and its implications in joint diseases across vertebrates.
