Researcher: Cory Abate-Shen
Research Overview:
Cory Abate-Shen's research focuses primarily on the intricate mechanisms and therapeutic strategies involved in prostate cancer, particularly as they relate to precision medicine and prevention. A significant aspect of the research involves investigating the role of genetic variants, specifically the tumor suppressor gene NKX3.1, in cancer initiation, progression, and differentiation. By employing various models, including genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), syngeneic and xenograft models, the studies explore factors such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of drug resistance and lineage plasticity. Additionally, the research emphasizes the potential of pharmacological agents, such as Metformin and 5Î±-reductase inhibitors like Dutasteride and Finasteride, in chemoprevention and active surveillance strategies for prostate cancer. By integrating insights from genetic profiling, drug response, and tumor biology, Abate-Shen's work aims to advance personalized approaches to prostate cancer treatment and prevention, thereby addressing disparities in health outcomes and enhancing the understanding of prostate cancer dynamics.
