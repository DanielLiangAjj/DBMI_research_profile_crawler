Researcher: adler perotte
Research Overview:
Adler Perotte's research encompasses a wide array of topics primarily focused on advancing the understanding and application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning within healthcare, particularly in the context of cardiovascular and renal diseases. His work investigates aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation alongside broader themes of valvular heart disease, utilizing techniques such as deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) for data-driven insights and improved clinical outcomes. Additionally, Perotte explores organ allocation and procurement processes in kidney transplantation, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based medicine and epidemiology. His contributions to health services and outcomes research highlight the use of electronic health records and data mining methodologies for patient readmission prediction, risk assessment, and survival analysis. Through a focus on social determinants of health and transfer learning, his research sheds light on the generalizability and reproducibility of findings across diverse populations, ultimately aiming to improve healthcare delivery and patient care strategies in the context of various diseases, including those exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
