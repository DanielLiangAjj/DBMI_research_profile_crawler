Researcher: Shuang Wang
Research Overview:
Shuang Wang's research encompasses a diverse range of topics within the fields of cancer biology, environmental health, pharmacology, and biotechnology. Notably, Wang has explored the roles of Epithelial Membrane Protein 3 in glioma and other cancers, examining associated signaling pathways and therapeutic targets. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 and multi-wavelength Raman spectroscopy, the research addresses critical mechanisms underpinning DNA damage and oxidative stress responses. Wang has also investigated the implications of traditionally used medicinal plants, as well as the pharmacological potential of bioactive compounds in managing diabetic nephropathies and promoting tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the research integrates machine learning approaches to predict clinical outcomes in sepsis and evaluates the impact of environmental factors like air pollution on health. By bridging traditional and modern scientific practices, Wang's contributions significantly advance our understanding of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies, advocating for evidence-based healthcare practices across various medical domains.
