Researcher: Yuanjia Wang
Research Overview:
Yuanjia Wang's research focuses on developing advanced statistical and machine learning methods to address complex challenges in biomedical fields, particularly related to neurological disorders, mental health, and personalized medicine. Key topics include the use of adaptive lasso and penalization methods for variable selection in time-varying networks, neuroimaging biomarkers to understand conditions such as major depression and Huntingtonâ€™s disease, as well as the integration of electronic health records and mHealth data for precision medicine. Wang employs a variety of modeling techniques, including structural equation modeling, latent state-space models, and causal forests, to analyze patient heterogeneity and treatment effects, particularly for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and anorexia nervosa. The research emphasizes individualized treatment strategies, machine learning applications in clinical trials, and the interpretation of outcome assessment data, aiming to enhance therapeutic efficacy and improve patient outcomes across diverse populations and conditions.
