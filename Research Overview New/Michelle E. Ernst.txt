Researcher: Michelle E. Ernst
Research Overview:
Michelle E. Ernst's research encompasses a diverse array of topics, focusing on the intersection of COVID-19, genetic counseling, and education. Her work investigates the impact of the pandemic on educational curricula and practitioner-based inquiry, particularly in the context of supporting individuals with genetic concerns such as CSNK2A1 mutations and conditions that lead to generalized epilepsy or myoclonic seizures. Through program evaluation, she emphasizes the significance of communication, disclosure, and peer support for patients with disorders of sex development (DSD) and related challenges, like MRKH syndrome. By integrating qualitative research methodologies, her findings illustrate the complexities of interpersonal relationships and the need for effective guidance during traumatic times. Ultimately, Ernstâ€™s research aims to enhance educational practices and support systems within genetic counseling while addressing the unique issues faced by diverse age groups during the ongoing challenges posed by pandemics.
