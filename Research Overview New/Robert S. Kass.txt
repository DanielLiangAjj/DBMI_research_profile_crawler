Researcher: Robert S. Kass
Research Overview:
Robert S. Kass's research predominantly explores the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying cardiac disorders, particularly focusing on long QT syndrome and its associated ion channelopathies. His work emphasizes the roles of various potassium channels, including KCNQ1 and IKS potassium channels, in cardiac electrophysiology, as well as the impact of mutations in these channels on arrhythmias and cardiovascular physiology. Kassâ€™s research also delves into pharmacological interventions, employing agents such as propranolol and mexiletine to address conditions like long QT syndrome and pulmonary hypertension. By integrating diverse methodologies, including patch-clamp techniques and transgenic models, his studies contribute significantly to understanding channel diversity in vascular smooth muscle and the pathophysiological implications of channel gating mechanisms. The comprehensive investigation of these ion channels, their interactions, and the genetic predispositions linked to various cardiac phenotypes positions Kass's work at the forefront of cardiovascular research, with implications for developing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes in arrhythmogenic diseases.
