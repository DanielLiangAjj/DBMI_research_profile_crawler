Researcher: Yiping W. Han
Research Overview:
Yiping W. Han's research primarily centers on the interplay between the human microbiome, specifically focusing on the role of oral bacteria such as *Fusobacterium nucleatum* and *Porphyromonas gingivalis*, and its implications for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth, stillbirth, and other pregnancy complications. His work utilizes techniques such as 16S rRNA sequencing and PCR to investigate microbial interactions within the placenta and cord blood, shedding light on the microbiome's potential impact on fetal health and development. Furthermore, his investigations extend to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, highlighting the virulence factors and mechanisms of bacterial infections linked to conditions such as periodontitis and endometritis. Through his robust exploration of host-pathogen interactions and disease models, Han contributes significantly to understanding how oral health and microbial populations influence pregnancy and overall maternal-fetal wellbeing, emphasizing the importance of microbial management in prenatal care.
