Researcher: Minoree Kohwi
Research Overview:
Minoree Kohwi's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms regulating neural progenitor competence, specifically the role of various genetic and cellular factors in determining cell fate and temporal identity during development. Utilizing the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, Kohwi investigates the interplay between transcription factors, such as Corto and Hunchback, and nuclear architecture, including the nuclear lamina, to understand how these components influence gene expression and stem cell behavior in the central nervous system. Key themes in this work include the modulation of neural stem cells' competence, the implications of Polycomb proteins in gene regulation, and the dynamics of nuclear proteins and chromatin organization. Overall, Kohwi's work contributes to a deeper understanding of the developmental processes that underlie neural differentiation and the broader implications for cellular identity in both invertebrates and vertebrates.
