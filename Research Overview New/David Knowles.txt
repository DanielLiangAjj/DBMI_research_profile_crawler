Researcher: David Knowles
Research Overview:
David Knowlesâ€™ research encompasses a broad range of topics within the intersections of computational methods, genetics, and evolutionary biology. His work on crystal plasticity and the grain boundary effect emphasizes the mechanical behavior of materials at a microscopic level. In genetics, he employs advanced techniques such as Mendelian randomization and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to understand complex traits and their relation to neuropsychiatric diseases, as well as the implications of acridine compounds like Doxorubicin in anthracycline-induced toxicity. His studies also explore population genetics and gene flow in plants, specifically within the Cycadales order, addressing climate change and its impact on biodiversity. Knowles integrates concepts from genomics and epigenomics in his research, improving our understanding of gene expression regulation and the roles of genetic variations across human populations. His interdisciplinary approach not only sheds light on biological mechanisms but also has significant implications in medicine, particularly in analyzing the interactions of drug responses in human-derived cells. Overall, his work significantly contributes to our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of both health and disease, ultimately advancing the fields of human biology and evolutionary frameworks.
