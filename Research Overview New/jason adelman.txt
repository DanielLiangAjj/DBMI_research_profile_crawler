Research Overview:
Jason Adelman's research primarily focuses on improving patient safety within healthcare systems by examining the epidemiology and detection of adverse events, medical errors, and near misses through the lens of health information technology. Utilizing data from electronic health records (EHRs) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems, his studies investigate the impact of clinical workflows, audit log data, and decision support systems in minimizing ordering errors and enhancing fall prevention strategies in hospital settings, particularly among nursing staff. His work also incorporates implementation science, assessing health system evaluations and quality improvement initiatives, including the FallTIPS program, to promote efficient practices that reduce risks such as medication errors and accidental falls. Overall, Adelmanâ€™s research contributes valuable insights into the integration of technology and evidence-based practices in healthcare delivery, ultimately aiming to bolster patient safety and improve care outcomes across various patient populations during critical phases, such as hospitalization and recovery from pandemics like COVID-19.
