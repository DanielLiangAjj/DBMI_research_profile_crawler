Researcher: Joseph Terwilliger
Research Overview:
Joseph Terwilliger's research primarily focuses on the interplay of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's and dementia, within vulnerable populations, especially in low-and-middle income countries like Venezuela. His work encompasses the ethical challenges faced in conducting research in humanitarian crises and highlights the importance of community participation. Through genetic and statistical models, he investigates genetic predispositions to diseases, utilizing genome-wide association studies to explore genetic linkage and variations associated with conditions such as schizophrenia and migraine disorders. Terwilliger emphasizes the need for robust research designs that address biases in epidemiological studies, which are crucial for understanding the complex interactions of genetics and environment in health outcomes. Overall, his research underscores a commitment to advancing public health knowledge and improving care strategies for the elderly and at-risk populations.
