Researcher: Yvon Woappi
Research Overview:
Yvon Woappi's research primarily focuses on the intersection of advanced cell culture techniques, specifically 3-D culture systems, and their implications for understanding epidermal stem cells, human keratinocytes, and related pathologies such as carcinogenesis and inflammatory diseases. His work extensively explores the mechanisms of anoikis and the role of various molecular players, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and integrin alpha-6, in cell proliferation and differentiation within spheroid models. Furthermore, he delves into critical areas such as nanomedicine and drug delivery, highlighting innovative approaches for combating antibiotic resistance, achieving gene transfer, and utilizing viral vectors for therapeutic interventions. Woappiâ€™s studies also address the complex interactions between commensal bacteria and foodborne pathogens in the context of immunity, emphasizing the importance of microbial dynamics and their implications for human health. By integrating systems biology and high-throughput techniques, his research contributes significant insights into the developing fields of theranostics and antimicrobial therapies, paving the way for advances in both cancer treatment and the management of microbial resistance.
