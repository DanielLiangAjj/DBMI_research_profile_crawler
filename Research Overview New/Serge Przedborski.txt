Researcher: Serge Przedborski
Research Overview:
Serge Przedborski's research predominantly focuses on neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). His work extensively examines the roles of biomarkers such as alpha-synuclein and superoxide dismutase-1 in disease mechanisms affecting dopaminergic neurons and motor neurons. Key themes in his research include the interplay between lipid metabolism, mitochondrial dynamics, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the context of neurodegeneration. Notably, his studies on cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms shed light on the contributions of glial cells, such as astrocytes and microglia, in the progression of these conditions. Additionally, he investigates molecular players involved in proteostasis, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, retromer, and necroptosis, alongside exploring therapeutic interventions using animal models. Overall, Przedborski's research underscores the complex interactions of genetic, cellular, and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
