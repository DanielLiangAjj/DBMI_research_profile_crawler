Researcher: Yacheng Liao
Research Overview:
Yacheng Liao's research primarily focuses on the roles of NF-κB2 and NPC2 in cholesterol transport and its transcriptional regulation. Utilizing various model systems, including cultured cells, human cell lines (such as HeLa cells), and murine knockout models, Liao investigates how these proteins function in biological transport mechanisms. The research highlights the interplay between intracellular signaling pathways, particularly the NF-κB signaling cascade, and their impact on vesicular transport proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis. By employing techniques like confocal microscopy and RNA interference, Liao's studies contribute valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of cholesterol transport in various organisms, including nonmammalian embryos and zebrafish, thereby advancing our understanding of lipid metabolism and its potential implications for human health.
