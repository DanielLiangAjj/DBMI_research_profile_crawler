Researcher: Max E. Gottesman
Research Overview:
Max E. Gottesman’s research delves deeply into the interactions and mechanics of transcription and its coupling with translation in bacterial systems, primarily utilizing *Escherichia coli* as a model organism. His work investigates the multifaceted roles of various factors such as NusG, transcription factors, and Gre factors, focusing on their impact on RNA polymerase activity, transcription elongation, and termination. His studies reveal essential insights into the mechanisms of transcription regulation, anti-backtracking, and the influence of divalent metal ions and nucleotides on RNA synthesis. Additionally, Gottesman explores the dynamics of transcriptional conflicts during DNA replication and the roles of bacteriophages like HK022 and λ in manipulating these processes. Through this extensive investigation of nucleotide analogues, ribosomal interactions, and enzymatic catalysis, his research significantly enhances our understanding of gene expression regulation, bacterial adaptability, and ancient viral interactions within microorganisms.
