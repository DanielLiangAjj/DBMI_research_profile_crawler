Researcher: Eric C.  Greene
Research Overview:
Eric C. Greene's research predominantly focuses on the intricate mechanisms of DNA repair and homologous recombination, utilizing innovative techniques such as single-molecule fluorescence and DNA curtains. His work examines the roles of various proteins, including Rad51, Rad54, Rdh54, Srs2, and Pif1 helicase, in the context of DNA stability and repair processes. Central to his investigations are the dynamics of ssDNA binding and translocation, as well as the functionality of recombination mediators during homologous recombination pathways. By employing approaches such as FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer), magnetic and optical tweezers, and advanced microscopy techniques, Greene explores how these processes contribute to genome integrity and cellular response to DNA damage. His research not only elucidates the molecular underpinnings of DNA repair mechanisms but also sheds light on critical aspects of genetic recombination and cellular responses in eukaryotic systems, particularly in model organisms like *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Through his studies, Greene aims to enhance the understanding of fundamental biological processes that have implications in fields such as genetics, cell biology, and therapeutic development for diseases related to DNA damage and repair deficiencies.
