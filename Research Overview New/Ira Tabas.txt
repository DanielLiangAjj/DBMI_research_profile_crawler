Researcher: Ira Tabas
Research Overview:
Ira Tabas' research focus centers around the complex interplay of immune responses, particularly involving T-lymphocytes and macrophages, in the context of atherosclerosis and metabolic diseases. His work examines how inflammation, efferocytosis (the engulfing of apoptotic cells), and myeloid cell dynamics influence disease progression, particularly under conditions like metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Tabas investigates the mechanisms governing inflammation resolution and crosstalk between hepatic cells, including Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, as well as the role of various signaling pathways and biomarkers associated with liver injury and fibrosis. His insights into the interactions between adaptive and innate immune responses offer potential therapeutic avenues for addressing cardiovascular diseases and liver-related conditions, thereby highlighting the significance of macrophage biology and T cell regulation in these pathologies.
