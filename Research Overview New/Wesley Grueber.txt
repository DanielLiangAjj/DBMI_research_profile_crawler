Researcher: Wesley Grueber
Research Overview:
Wesley Grueber's research primarily focuses on the complex mechanisms of neural circuit development and the intricacies of axon targeting and synaptic specificity within Drosophila, particularly in somatosensory neurons. His work investigates the roles of various cell surface proteins, including the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam2) and Basigin, in dendrite morphogenesis and neuronal communication. Employing techniques such as genome editing, calcium imaging using GCaMP, and high-speed microscopy, Grueber examines how sensory neurons in Drosophila—specifically those involved in nociception and proprioception—form functional neural circuits. By exploring the interplay of transcription factors, membrane proteins, and neurogenesis, his studies contribute significantly to understanding how genetic and molecular factors orchestrate the development of neuronal architecture and function. Overall, Grueber’s research sheds light on the developmental processes underpinning sensory perception and neuronal pathfinding, with implications for understanding neurological disorders and their underlying mechanisms.
