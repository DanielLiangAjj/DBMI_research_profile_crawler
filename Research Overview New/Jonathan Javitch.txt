Researcher: Jonathan Javitch
Research Overview:
Jonathan Javitch's research focuses primarily on the biophysical characterization and signaling dynamics of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly within the context of neurotransmitter systems involving dopamine and acetylcholine. Utilizing advanced techniques such as bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), single-molecule imaging, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), his work investigates receptor activation mechanisms, ligand interactions, and the functional roles of arrestins in cellular signaling. His studies span across various models, including mammalian and Drosophila systems, while also delving into genetic and transcriptomic analyses to explore the implications of GPCR signaling in cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and ADHD. Through the integration of machine learning and automation in experimental design, Javitch aims to enhance our understanding of neurotransmitter transport dynamics, receptor conformational changes, and the overall impact of GPCR signaling on behavior and cognition. His contributions to the field emphasize the importance of GPCRs in drug discovery and the therapeutic targeting of neuropsychiatric conditions.
