Researcher: Richard Axel
Research Overview:
Richard Axel's research spans a multidisciplinary approach to understanding neural circuits and sensory processing, particularly through the lens of olfaction and behavior in model organisms such as Drosophila and cephalopods like cuttlefish. His work integrates advanced techniques including MRI, calcium imaging, and deep learning to explore complex neural mechanisms involved in learning, memory, and spatial navigation. His investigations into the molecular and genetic underpinnings of behaviors such as feeding, exploration, and fear conditioning emphasize the role of key brain regions, including the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and mushroom bodies. Axel's contributions extend to the evolutionary understanding of sensory systems, employing gene editing and embryogenesis studies in new model organisms. Through these diverse methodologies and theoretical frameworks, Axel has significantly advanced our comprehension of how organisms perceive and respond to their environments, reinforcing the intricate connection between neural circuits and behavior.
