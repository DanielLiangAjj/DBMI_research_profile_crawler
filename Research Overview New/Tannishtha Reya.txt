Researcher: Tannishtha Reya
Research Overview:
Tannishtha Reya's research significantly contributes to the understanding of cancer biology, particularly focusing on pancreatic cancer and hematopoietic malignancies. Key themes in her work include the role of Musashi as a crucial RNA-binding protein that influences cancer stem cell behavior, tumor evolution, and therapy resistance. Her studies explore the tumor microenvironment and its impact on the dynamics of cancer progression, emphasizing the significance of the cell of origin and stem cell differentiation pathways. By uncovering the interplay between Wnt signaling, cytokines, and cancer stem cells, she highlights critical mechanisms that underpin tumor metastasis and drug resistance. Furthermore, her research employs advanced methodologies such as single-cell imaging and high-throughput screening, positioning her work at the forefront of molecular oncology and potential therapeutic strategies. Overall, Reya's research advances our knowledge of neoplastic stem cells and offers insights into developing targeted therapies for challenging cancers like pancreatic and acute myeloid leukemia.
