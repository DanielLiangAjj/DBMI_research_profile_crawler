Research Overview:
Paul Clayton's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on the intersections of diet, exercise, and neurological health, particularly in the context of female populations and aging adults. His work critically examines the impacts of various dietary supplements, such as fenugreek and Gynostemma pentaphyllum, on body composition, muscle strength, and overall brain health, as well as the implications of the endocannabinoid system and its modulators, including cannabidiol and palmitoylethanolamide, in addressing neuroinflammation and neurological disorders. Clayton also delves into the pharmacological safety and efficacy of these compounds, exploring their potential as nutraceuticals and immunomodulators in inflammatory responses. In addition, his research touches upon public health concerns regarding dietary shifts, exercise patterns, and their relation to chronic diseases within the framework of socio-economic dynamics and international trade. Overall, Clayton's contributions highlight the significance of an integrated approach to nutrition and exercise in promoting cognitive health and managing chronic conditions.
