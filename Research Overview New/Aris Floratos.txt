Researcher: Aris Floratos
Research Overview:
Aris Floratos's research primarily focuses on the intersection of genomics, computational biology, and systems biology, emphasizing the role of ATP-binding cassette transporters and their genetic implications in disease predisposition. Through comprehensive genome-wide association studies, the researcher explores the genetic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that contribute to conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, underscoring the importance of genetic databases and algorithms in understanding allele frequencies and gene interactions. Additionally, Floratos leverages advanced computational models and software to analyze protein conformation and assess adverse drug reactions, highlighting the need for organizational frameworks and international cooperation in biomedical research. Overall, the research advances our understanding of genetic factors influencing health and disease, aiming to enhance predictive models in genomics and foster improvements in pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine.
