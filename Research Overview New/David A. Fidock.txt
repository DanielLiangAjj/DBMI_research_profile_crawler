Researcher: David A. Fidock
Research Overview:
David A. Fidock's research focuses on the complex interplay of genetic, proteomic, and ecological factors contributing to drug resistance in *Plasmodium falciparum*, the parasite responsible for malaria. His work extensively investigates mechanisms behind artemisinin resistance, particularly through analyzing mutations in the PfCRT protein and applying innovative techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and conditional knockdown approaches. Fidock's studies employ molecular modeling, proteomics, and genomics to understand the evolution of drug resistance, assessing fitness costs associated with various PfCRT mutations and their impact on treatment outcomes. He explores the pharmacodynamics of artemisinin-based combination therapies and the role of factors like intercellular communication and cellular accumulation in mediating resistance to antimalarials. With implications for global health, his research aims to inform drug discovery and resistance monitoring efforts, ultimately contributing to more effective malaria control strategies amidst rising concerns over multi-drug resistance.
