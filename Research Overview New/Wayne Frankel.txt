Researcher: Wayne Frankel
Research Overview:
Wayne Frankel's research primarily focuses on the role of dynamin-1 and adeno-associated viruses in understanding and treating developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE), with specific attention to disorders such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and childhood epilepsy. Utilizing various experimental models, including knockout mouse models, his work investigates how alterations in synaptic transmission and network activity contribute to epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental disorders. By employing techniques such as gene therapy and RNA interference, Frankel aims to explore the underlying genetic factors that lead to conditions like infantile spasms and the autistic spectrum disorder. His research emphasizes the significance of dynamin's function in endocytic cycles and synaptic signaling, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions in epilepsy and related conditions, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind these debilitating diseases.
