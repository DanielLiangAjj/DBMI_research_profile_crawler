Researcher: Sarah Collins Rossetti
Research Overview:
Sarah Collins Rossetti's research primarily focuses on the development and implementation of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) aimed at enhancing patient safety and improving clinical outcomes in inpatient settings. Utilizing advanced technologies such as machine learning and natural language processing, her work emphasizes the importance of integrating electronic health records (EHRs) into clinical workflows to facilitate real-time data capture and predictive modeling. Rossetti emphasizes qualitative research methodologies, including interviews and surveys, to understand the intricacies of nursing and physician workflows and how these affect clinical decision-making processes. Her investigation into early warning systems and clinical deterioration seeks to establish robust frameworks for early diagnosis and intervention, thereby enhancing overall healthcare delivery. Furthermore, her studies grapple with the challenges posed by documentation burdens and advocate for the standardization of nursing terminology to streamline clinical communication and efficacy. By merging health informatics with quality improvement and infection control, particularly in critical and intensive care environments, Rossetti aims to fortify the health policy landscape and contribute significantly to the field of nursing informatics and clinical informatics.
