Researcher: Aaron D Viny
Research Overview:
Aaron D. Viny's research focuses on the molecular and genetic underpinnings of myeloid malignancies, particularly in the context of germline predispositions and the role of cohesin complexes, specifically Stag1 and Stag2, in hematopoietic stem cells. His work employs mouse models to investigate chromatin dynamics and nuclear topology, shedding light on conditions such as myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia. Additionally, he explores epidemiological trends and health disparities among pediatric and adolescent populations, utilizing extensive datasets from the SEER program. Viny's multifaceted approach integrates cytogenetics, molecular genetics, and epigenomic profiling, contributing valuable insights into survival rates and treatment outcomes for hematologic neoplasms across diverse demographic groups. Through his research, he highlights the critical intersections of genetics, environment, and socio-economic factors in the etiology and progression of various blood cancers.
