Researcher: Chunhua Weng
Research Overview:
Chunhua Weng's research primarily centers around the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically natural language processing (NLP), and biomedical informatics to enhance diagnostic decision-making and improve clinical trial processes, particularly for rare diseases. His extensive work utilizes large language models (such as Llama 2 and ChatGPT) for data modeling, knowledge representation, and concept normalization, leading to enhanced recruitment strategies in clinical research. By exploring social determinants of health, Weng's studies also target improving health equity and participant selection in clinical trials, emphasizing the significance of electronic health records (EHRs) in real-world data utilization. His contributions to evidence-based medicine are reflected in developing methods such as eligibility prescreening, quality improvement practices, and the integration of health data standards like the Unified Medical Language System and OMOP-CDM. Through his innovative use of deep learning and machine learning techniques, Weng aims to make significant improvements in the accuracy of patient outcomes and the efficiency of clinical data processes, ultimately advancing the field of personalized medicine and health informatics.
