Researcher: Anthony Fitzpatrick
Research Overview:
Anthony Fitzpatrick's research primarily focuses on advanced electron microscopy techniques, particularly cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and their application in understanding neurodegenerative diseases and protein aggregation. His work utilizes methodologies such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), phase contrast imaging, and ultrafast electron microscopy to investigate the structural dynamics of proteins, including tau proteins and amyloid fibrils, which are implicated in conditions like Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Fitzpatrick's studies delve into post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and ubiquitination, that affect protein conformation and aggregation. Additionally, his research incorporates visual proteomics and advanced imaging strategies to explore the role of various cellular components, like endosomes and lysosomes, in neurodegeneration. Overall, Fitzpatrick's contributions to integrated structural biology aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies and to advance the understanding of biophysical phenomena related to protein dynamics.
