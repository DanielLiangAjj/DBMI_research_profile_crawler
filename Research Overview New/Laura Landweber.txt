Researcher: Laura Landweber
Research Overview:
Laura Landweber's research focuses on the intricate genetics and epigenetics of ciliates, particularly within the context of Oxytricha and its relative species, such as Euplotes. Her work emphasizes key themes including genome rearrangement, nuclear proteomics, and the complexities of macronucleus and micronucleus dynamics. Through comparative genomics and proteomics, her studies explore how these organisms undergo significant DNA elimination, the roles of transposable elements, and the regulation of scrambled genes. Landweberâ€™s investigations extend to the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling, alongside the contributions of noncoding RNAs and small RNAs in genetic regulation and genome integrity. By employing high-throughput sequencing techniques and computational biology, her research not only elucidates the evolutionary biology of ciliates but also contributes to the broader understanding of genetic variation, gene duplication, and the evolutionary implications of genomic instability. This comprehensive approach positions her work at the intersection of genetics, evolution, and molecular biology, significantly advancing knowledge in the field of protozoan genomics.
