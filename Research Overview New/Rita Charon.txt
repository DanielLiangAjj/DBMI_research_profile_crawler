Researcher: Rita Charon
Research Overview:
Rita Charon's research primarily focuses on the intersection of medical education, narrative medicine, and the physician-patient relationship, with an emphasis on empathy and the humanities in healthcare. Her studies explore innovative teaching methods aimed at improving medical students' competencies in patient care through an understanding of personal narratives and creative expression. Key themes include the development of professional patient relationships, the role of empathy in mental health therapies, and the implementation of narrative techniques to enhance clinical competence. Charon advocates for integrating arts and humanities into medical curricula, arguing that such approaches can foster better communication and understanding in healthcare settings, ultimately leading to improved patient-centered care outcomes. Her work underscores the importance of addressing psychological factors and interpersonal dynamics in medical education, making a significant contribution to both the fields of behavioral sciences and medical humanities. Through her empirical research conducted in diverse contexts, including New York City and broader academic discussions on medical ethics and patient participation, Charon aims to reshape the way healthcare professionals relate to their patients, emphasizing that the practice of medicine should encompass both technical proficiency and emotional intelligence.
