Researcher: Shan Zha
Research Overview:
Shan Zha's research focuses on the intricate processes involved in DNA damage response and repair mechanisms, particularly through the roles of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), specifically PARP1 and PARP2. Utilizing advanced techniques such as live cell quantitative imaging, Zha investigates how PARylation, a post-translational modification mediated by PARPs, influences DNA repair pathways, including non-homologous end-joining, V(D)J recombination, and class-switch recombination. His work sheds light on the regulation of DNA damage responses and the significance of checkpoint kinases, such as ATM and DNA-PKcs, in maintaining genomic stability during cellular replication and development. Furthermore, Zha explores the potential therapeutic applications of PARP inhibitors in cancer treatment, emphasizing the link between DNA repair mechanisms and lymphomagenesis. Through his contributions, Zha enhances our understanding of cellular responses to DNA damage, advancing the field of cancer biology and therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting DNA repair pathways.
