Researcher: Michael Shen
Research Overview:
Michael Shen's research focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning within the fields of oncology, healthcare, and regenerative medicine, particularly as they pertain to understanding and predicting cancer progression, treatment outcomes, and health care costs. His studies examine the implications of various biological factors, such as tumor heterogeneity, the tumor microenvironment, and the dynamics of stem cell differentiation, as well as the role of social determinants of health and telemedicine in patient care. Additionally, Shen investigates the biological mechanisms underlying conditions like prostate cancer and pulmonary hypertension using advanced simulation techniques, organoids, and genetically engineered mouse models. Through his explorations of bioethics, compassionate use policies, and health care utilization strategies, he aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge biomedical research and practical health applications, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes in complex clinical settings.
