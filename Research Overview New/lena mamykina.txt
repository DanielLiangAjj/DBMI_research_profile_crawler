Research Overview:
Lena Mamykina's research focuses on enhancing health outcomes for older individuals, particularly in the context of chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes. Her work leverages the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to design personalized and effective home healthcare services that incorporate mobile health (mHealth) technologies, including chatbots and health coaching tools aimed at self-management and motivation. She emphasizes personalization in health interventions, employing machine learning and data assimilation techniques to enhance decision-support systems and improve care coordination. Mamykina's studies explore critical factors such as health disparities, self-monitoring behaviors, and the social determinants of health, utilizing qualitative methodologies to gather insights from diverse populations. By integrating health information technology, patient-generated health data, and community-based participatory research, her work aims to establish frameworks that empower patients towards effective self-care and health behavior change, ultimately contributing to improved chronic disease management and health equity.
