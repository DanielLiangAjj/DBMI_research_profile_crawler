Researcher: Larry Abbott
Research Overview:
Larry Abbott's research primarily focuses on the dynamics of cortical networks and neuronal modeling, with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms underlying up-down state transitions within the brain. His work leverages a diverse range of topics, including the structure and function of neural pathways, synaptic interactions, and the connectome in various animal models such as mice and bees. By investigating these elements, Abbott aims to elucidate the foundational processes that contribute to brain intelligence and memory. Through his interdisciplinary approach within the field of neurosciences, he contributes valuable insights into the complex interplay between neurons and the functional architecture of the brain.
