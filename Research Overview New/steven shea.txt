Research Overview:
Steven Shea's research explores the intricate relationships between sleep patterns, circadian rhythms, and cardiovascular health, particularly focusing on their implications for conditions such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and stress-related disorders. Through psychometric evaluations and clinical studies utilizing techniques like polysomnography and magnetic resonance imaging, Shea investigates the impact of circadian misalignment on sleep quality, hormone regulation, and cardiovascular risks across different populations, particularly in midlife adults and diverse ethnic groups. Additionally, his work delves into the physiological and psychological effects of chronic stress, as well as the potential therapeutic roles of lifestyle interventions and cannabinoids in promoting sleep and overall health. By bridging sleep medicine with cardiovascular research, Shea aims to enhance our understanding of how circadian biology influences health outcomes and informs preventive strategies in clinical practice.
