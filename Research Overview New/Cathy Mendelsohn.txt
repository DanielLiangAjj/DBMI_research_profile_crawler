Researcher: Cathy Mendelsohn
Research Overview:
Cathy Mendelsohn's research focuses on the intricate processes of development and regeneration within the urogenital system, with a particular emphasis on the urothelium and its associated structures. Her work extensively investigates the role of basal cells and progenitor cells in urothelial development and the mechanisms underlying epithelial barrier characteristics, such as endoreplication and polyploidy. By utilizing various animal models, especially transgenic and knockout mice, she explores the molecular pathways involved in bladder cancer and the tumorigenic potential of specific oncogenes, including the RAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor pathways. Additionally, her research examines the influence of retinoids on cellular differentiation, apoptosis, and regeneration across various urogenital tissues, highlighting the significance of these compounds in maintaining normal physiological functions and combating cancerous transformations. Through her comprehensive study of epithelial development, tumor biology, and regenerative mechanisms, Mendelsohn contributes crucial insights into the understanding of urinary tract health and disease.
