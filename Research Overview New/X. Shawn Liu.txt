Researcher: X. Shawn Liu
Research Overview:
X. Shawn Liu's research focuses on the innovative applications of CRISPR technology for editing the epigenome in the context of various neurological and oncological disorders. His studies explore the potential of dCas9-mediated epigenome editing to reactivate the FMR1 gene in fragile X syndrome, a brain disorder characterized by CGG repeat expansions. Furthermore, Liu is investigating the implications of DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs in mediating responses to chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer, where he identifies prognostic biomarkers. Through an extensive examination of gene editing mechanisms and their effects on neuronal function and cancer cell biology, Liu's work aims to bridge the gap between genetic research and therapeutic development for complex diseases affecting human health. With a compelling focus on disorders like Rett syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and pancreatic neoplasms, his research contributes valuable insights into the intersection of epigenetics and personalized medicine.
