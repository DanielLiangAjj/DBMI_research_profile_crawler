Researcher: Henry Colecraft
Research Overview:
Henry Colecraft's research primarily focuses on the intricate mechanisms of ion channel regulation, particularly relating to KCNQ1 and various calcium channels, and how these processes are linked to significant clinical conditions, such as long QT syndrome and cardiac arrhythmias. His work employs advanced techniques in molecular and cellular biology, including the use of nanobodies, flow cytometry, and various proteomic analyses to explore the biochemistry of ion channels and their trafficking. A significant portion of his research investigates the roles of ubiquitin-proteasome systems in modulating these channels, addressing the implications of phosphorylation and deubiquitination in channel function and regulation. Colecraft's studies, often utilizing animal models and cell lines, aim to elucidate the pathophysiological pathways involved in conditions such as neuropathic pain and obesity, demonstrating the broader relevance of ion channel dynamics in health and disease. Ultimately, his findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cell signaling mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for channelopathies.
