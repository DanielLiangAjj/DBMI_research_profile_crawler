Researcher: Ivaylo Ivanov
Research Overview:
Ivaylo Ivanov's research focuses on the intricate relationships between immune responses, microbiota, and metabolic processes, particularly in the context of the gastrointestinal system. His work explores the roles of various immune cell populations such as Th17 cells, Tregs, and different mediators like IL-10 and c-MAF, shedding light on their influence on mucosal immunity and the body's inflammatory responses. Moreover, Ivanov investigates how segmented filamentous bacteria and commensal microbiota impact gut health and metabolic disorders, including obesity and metabolic syndrome. His studies also delve into the molecular mechanisms of protein biosynthesis and translational regulation, emphasizing the significance of factors such as uORFs and the ribosomal dynamics in gene expression. By utilizing advanced methodologies, including cryo-electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, he aims to elucidate the complexities of gene regulation and immune modulation. Ultimately, Ivanov's research aims to bridge the gaps between microbiota composition, immune function, and metabolic health, offering insights that could inform therapeutic approaches to combat related diseases.
