Researcher: Qing R. Fan
Research Overview:
Qing R. Fan's research encompasses a wide array of topics primarily focusing on the biochemistry and structural biology of receptors, particularly the calcium-sensing receptor and GABAB receptor. Key areas of exploration include the activation mechanisms, allosteric modulation, and the structural characteristics of these receptors, employing advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. Fan's work intricately investigates the roles of principal and auxiliary subunits, ligand recognition, and the symmetries within receptor complexes, alongside the implications of protein binding, multimerization, and cellular signaling pathways in calcium homeostasis. His studies involve various biological models, including human and mouse systems, to dissect the underlying biochemical processes. Ultimately, Fan's research contributes to a deeper understanding of receptor dynamics and their relevance in physiological and pathological contexts, paving the way for potential therapeutic applications involving calcium channels and G-protein-coupled receptors.
