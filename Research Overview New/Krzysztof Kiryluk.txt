Researcher: Krzysztof Kiryluk
Research Overview:
Krzysztof Kiryluk's research primarily investigates the genetic underpinnings and health disparities related to kidney diseases, particularly focusing on chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney transplantation outcomes, and glomerular diseases such as IgA nephropathy and membranous nephropathy. His work leverages advanced genomic techniques, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Mendelian randomization, and whole-genome sequencing, to explore the complex interactions of genetic variations, environmental factors, and demographic influences on kidney health. Key findings include the significant impact of African ancestry and APOL1 gene variations on kidney allograft rejection and failure, highlighting the importance of personalized medicine in nephrology. Additionally, Kiryluk's research emphasizes the utility of biomarkers and polygenic risk scores (PRS) in predicting disease progression and treatment outcomes. Through these investigations, he aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of kidney diseases and enhance precision medicine approaches for diverse populations, ultimately striving to improve patient care and outcomes in nephrology.
