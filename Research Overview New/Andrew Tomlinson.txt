Researcher: Andrew Tomlinson
Research Overview:
Andrew Tomlinson's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focused on the physiological aspects of exercise and respiratory function in various contexts, particularly heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), aging, and related respiratory sensations. His work examines key concepts such as dyspnea, exercise intolerance, gas exchange inefficiency, and pulmonary function, emphasizing the mechanics of breathing and the physiological effects of exercise, especially in elderly populations. Moreover, he explores related veterinary applications in canine health and surgical repercussions, specifically in the context of gall bladder conditions in dogs, suggesting a broad translational aspect of his findings. His investigations further extend into genetic and developmental biology, utilizing models like *Drosophila melanogaster* to dissect mechanisms underlying cell differentiation, eye development, and signaling pathways that can impact overall physiological and morphological phenotype expression. Overall, Tomlinson's interdisciplinary approach sheds light on the complex interactions between physical capacity, respiratory dynamics, and genetic factors, contributing valuable insights into both human and animal health.
