Research Overview:
Rita Kukafka's research centers on the intersection of genetic predisposition, specifically regarding BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, and the implications for breast cancer risk in diverse communities, including the Orthodox Jewish population. Her work employs community-based participatory research methodologies to enhance health literacy and decision-making processes surrounding genetic testing and cancer prevention strategies. This includes exploring the roles of digital health technologies, artificial intelligence, and consumer health informatics in facilitating effective risk communication and patient engagement in health promotion efforts. Additionally, Kukafka investigates the importance of collaborative technologies in medical decision-making, with a focus on the psychosocial aspects such as depression and diabetes that influence health behavior. By emphasizing community needs and implementing tailored interventions, her research seeks to improve access to information and decision support systems, ultimately contributing to better health outcomes in vulnerable populations. Through her extensive work, Kukafka advances the fields of public health and medical informatics, promoting equitable healthcare delivery and informed patient participation.
