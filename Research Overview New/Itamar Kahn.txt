Researcher: Itamar Kahn
Research Overview:
Itamar Kahn's research primarily focuses on the interplay between neurobiological conditions and advanced imaging techniques, particularly within the contexts of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Autism, and ADHD. Utilizing mouse models, Kahn investigates the structural and functional connectivity of the brain through tools such as fMRI and advanced MRI methods, including applications of iron oxide nanoparticles and magneto fluorescence nanoparticle labeling. His work seeks to correlate changes in oligodendrocyte function and brain atrophies with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions, emphasizing the importance of understanding brain networks, particularly in pediatric populations. By integrating concepts from brain connectomics and neuroimaging with biophysical methods like Monte Carlo optogenetics and light scattering, Kahn aims to illuminate the complexities of brain evolution and connectivity across the mammalian lifespan. Overall, his research contributes to a deeper understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive and behavioral disorders, with implications for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in clinical settings.
