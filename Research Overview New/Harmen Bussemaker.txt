Researcher: Harmen Bussemaker
Research Overview:
Harmen Bussemaker's research primarily focuses on the complex interplay between transcription factors and gene regulation, with a particular emphasis on DNA binding specificity within the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein families. His work utilizes advanced computational modeling and machine learning approaches, particularly biophysically interpretable models, to analyze the functional impacts of missense mutations and the regulatory roles of genetic variations, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL). Bussemaker's research involves high-throughput techniques like ChIP-seq and SELEX to map binding sites and explore chromatin architecture, offering insights into how epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation influence transcription factor activity. His investigations aim to unravel the mechanisms of gene expression regulation, enhancer-promoter interactions, and the implications of non-coding genetic variations on transcriptional dynamics, ultimately contributing to our understanding of gene regulatory networks in various cellular contexts. Through this multifaceted approach, his work significantly advances the fields of genomics and computational biology, providing a deeper understanding of how transcription factors orchestrate complex gene expression programs.
