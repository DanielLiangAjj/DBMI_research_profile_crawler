Researcher: Dmitriy Aronov
Research Overview:
Dmitriy Aronov's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationship between the brain's neural structures and behavior, particularly in relation to memory, navigation, and learning processes among avian species. His studies delve into the roles of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, especially in animals like the black-capped chickadee and tufted titmouse, which are known for their sophisticated food-caching behaviors. By utilizing various methodologies, including virtual reality and neural network models, Aronov investigates how spatial cues and episodic memory are employed by these birds for effective food retrieval and navigation. His work extends into examining neural plasticity, predictive coding, and the functionality of specialized neurons such as grid and cue cells, contributing to a broader understanding of cognitive neuroscience and the mechanisms underlying spatial navigation and memory in both avian and mammalian species. This multitude of research underscores the complexity of cognitive processes and neural interactions that facilitate adaptive behaviors in varying environmental contexts.
