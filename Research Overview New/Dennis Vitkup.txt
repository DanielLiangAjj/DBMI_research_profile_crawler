Researcher: Dennis Vitkup
Research Overview:
Dennis Vitkup's research focuses on the intricate dynamics of molecular evolution and protein function, delving into areas such as protein stability, misfolding, and the mechanisms underlying receptor endocytosis in various biological systems. By leveraging computational biology and systems biology approaches, he explores signaling networks and their role in cell memory and population heterogeneity, utilizing concepts from the physics of living systems and maximum entropy frameworks. His work spans multiple species, from humans to E. coli, and addresses key topics in evolutionary biology, including orthologous protein evolution and protein clocks. Vitkup's contributions also extend to understanding the implications of genetic variation and mutation in relation to complex diseases, where his insights into metabolic networks, gene regulatory networks, and the genomic architecture enhance our comprehension of health and disease phenotypes. This interdisciplinary approach signifies a comprehensive effort to unravel the fundamental principles of life through an evolutionary lens, aiming to bridge molecular biology with broader biological phenomena.
