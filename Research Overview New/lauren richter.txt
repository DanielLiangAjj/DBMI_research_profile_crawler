Research Overview:
Dr. Lauren Richter's research encompasses a diverse array of topics centered around health equity, algorithmic fairness, and the intersection of technology and environmental health. Her work investigates the implications of electronic health records (EHR) within the frameworks of causal and principal fairness, with a particular emphasis on predictive modeling in healthcare, including the assessment of glomerular filtration rates and the management of conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, Dr. Richter explores the environmental determinants of health, examining the impacts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and other emerging contaminants on public health, particularly in relation to breast cancer and community-based participatory research. Her integrated approach combines machine learning applications with social justice concerns, advocating for equitable healthcare outcomes and the responsible use of technology in clinical decision-making. Overall, her research aims to bridge the gap between health technology and equitable healthcare delivery, addressing disparities and fostering community engagement in health-related social movements.
