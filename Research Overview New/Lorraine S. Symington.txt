Researcher: Lorraine S. Symington
Research Overview:
Dr. Lorraine S. Symington has extensively researched the mechanisms of DNA repair and maintenance of genomic stability, focusing particularly on homologous recombination (HR) processes in the yeast model organism *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Her work highlights the significance of various proteins and enzymes such as Rad51, Mre11, and Sae2 in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSB), a critical form of DNA damage. Symington's research elucidates the interplay between homologous recombination and other repair pathways, such as break-induced replication and single-strand annealing, as well as the roles of different nucleases like Exo1 and Dna2 in DNA end resection. Additionally, her studies have contributed to understanding DNA damage checkpoints and their importance in maintaining genome integrity during replication stress. Through her investigations, Lorraine S. Symington has provided valuable insights into the fundamental genetic and molecular processes that ensure DNA repair fidelity and prevent genomic instability, with implications reaching beyond yeast to broader biological systems, including human health and disease.
