Researcher: Patrick Ryan
Research Overview:
Patrick Ryan's research is multifaceted, focusing primarily on the intersections of environmental health, social determinants of health, and medical informatics. His work extensively investigates the impacts of ambient air pollution, particularly ultrafine particles, on respiratory health outcomes, including asthma and chronic pain, while also addressing the societal implications of environmental exposure, such as racism and socioeconomic disparities in health care. Additionally, Ryan employs advanced methodologies like mediation analysis and algorithms for phenotyping and data standardization to enhance understanding of complex health phenomena, including suicide risk and substance-related disorders. His commitment to evidence-based medicine and real-world evidence is evident in his use of large datasets, electronic health records, and observational studies, ensuring high standards of reproducibility and validity in research findings. Furthermore, he emphasizes the importance of training future medical professionals in research and clinical practices, producing curricula that promote both scholarly activities and real-world applications. Overall, Ryan's contributions significantly advance the fields of epidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology, and health informatics, while advocating for a more equitable approach to healthcare access and research methodologies.
