Researcher: Attila Losonczy
Research Overview:
Attila Losonczy's research explores the intricate mechanisms underlying learning and memory, particularly focusing on the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques, such as two-photon calcium imaging, he investigates synaptic plasticity, neuronal dynamics, and place cell activity associated with navigation and reward learning. His studies delve into the enhancements of data analysis methods and the implementation of optogenetics to manipulate neural circuits, revealing insights into the role of dendritic excitability and interneuron interactions. By examining phenomena like sharp-wave ripples, engram formation, and contextual remapping, Losonczy's work illuminates the neural basis of cognitive functions and lays the groundwork for understanding how memories are formed, consolidated, and retrieved. Overall, his research significantly contributes to the fields of neuroscience and cognitive psychology, combining experimental rigor with innovative analytical approaches to deepen our understanding of memory systems.
