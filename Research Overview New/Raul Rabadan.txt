Researcher: Raul Rabadan
Research Overview:
Raul Rabadan's research is anchored in the interdisciplinary fields of cancer genomics, computational biology, and machine learning, where he explores the genetic underpinnings of various cancers, including pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma. His work encompasses the analysis of somatic variants, allele-specific expression, and tumor heterogeneity, harnessing advanced techniques in single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial omics. Notably, he employs data imputation, dimensionality reduction, and joint analysis of single-cell and spatial data to enhance the understanding of the tumor microenvironment and the genetic factors influencing cancer progression and treatment response. Additionally, Rabadanâ€™s studies extend to the evolution of viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, integrating principles of virology with genomic surveillance and evolutionary biology. His multifaceted approach also addresses cancer immunotherapy and drug resistance, contributing valuable insights that bridge cancer research with broader implications in human health and disease management. Through these contributions, Rabadan aims to elucidate the complex interplay of genetics in cancer treatment, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies.
