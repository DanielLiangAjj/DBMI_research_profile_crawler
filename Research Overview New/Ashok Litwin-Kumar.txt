Researcher: Ashok Litwin-Kumar
Research Overview:
Ashok Litwin-Kumar's research primarily focuses on the intersection of memory, learning, and decision-making within the realm of neuroscience, emphasizing computational biology and neuronal plasticity. His work investigates the roles of various neural circuits, including the cerebellum and motor cortex, in memory consolidation and flexible behavior. By employing modeling techniques and analyzing balanced cortical networks, Litwin-Kumar examines how neural variability and spontaneous cortical activity contribute to olfactory processing and memory representation. His investigations extend to animal models, particularly Drosophila and mice, where he explores neuronal pathways, synaptic dynamics, and the mechanisms underlying long-term memory. The integration of computational models with empirical data aims to elucidate the complex interplay of learning and memory systems, thereby advancing the understanding of cognitive processes in both animals and humans.
