Researcher: Mimi Shirasu-Hiza
Research Overview:
Mimi Shirasu-Hiza's research focuses on the intersection of genetics, genomics, and neuroscience, primarily utilizing *Drosophila melanogaster* as a model organism. Central to her work are the investigations into circadian rhythms, oxidative stress, and their roles in aging, longevity, and metabolism. She employs advanced genetic techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas9 and GAL4/UAS systems, to explore the molecular mechanisms regulating circadian clocks and their influence on sleep, dietary restriction, and immune responses to various pathogens, including *Burkholderia cepacia* and *Listeria monocytogenes*. Additionally, her studies delve into how environmental factors, such as diet and glucose availability, affect lifespan and overall organismal health. Through these multifaceted approaches, Shirasu-Hiza aims to clarify the genetic pathways that underlie resilience, immunity, and longevity in the context of aging and stress, establishing foundational insights relevant to both basic biology and potential therapeutic interventions.
