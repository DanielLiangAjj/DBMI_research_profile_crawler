Researcher: Tom Maniatis
Research Overview:
Tom Maniatis's research focuses primarily on understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). His work extensively examines the interactions and roles of key proteins such as TBK1, SOD1, and various cadherins in glial and motor neuron functions, emphasizing their involvement in neuroinflammation, selective autophagy, and non-cell autonomous mechanisms contributing to ALS pathology. Moreover, Maniatis explores the significance of gene expression regulation, alternative splicing, and the genetic and environmental factors influencing neural circuit development and neuropsychiatric disorders. His use of diverse animal models, including SOD1 mouse models and knockout mice, allows for the investigation of disease progression and molecular interactions impacting neuron viability and motor neuron autophagy. Through his rigorous analysis of protein interactions, signaling pathways, and transcriptional regulation, Maniatis aims to enrich our understanding of ALS, paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions.
