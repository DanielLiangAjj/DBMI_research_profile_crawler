Researcher: Zhezhen Jin
Research Overview:
Zhezhen Jin's research encompasses a wide range of topics primarily focused on the interrelation of cardiovascular health, cancer, cognitive function, and outcomes related to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Key areas of study include the impact of acromegaly and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) on tumorigenesis and cardiovascular risks, notably arterial stiffness and left ventricular function. The research highlights sex-based differences in cardiovascular responses and disease prevalence, particularly in stroke and atrial fibrillation among elderly populations. Advanced imaging techniques like echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging are employed to assess left ventricular and atrial functions, with special attention to the predictive value of global longitudinal strain metrics. There is also a focus on the long-term cognitive implications of conditions such as Alzheimerâ€™s and the influence of underlying health factors, including obesity and hypertension, on quality of life among pediatric and adult patients. Furthermore, the integration of statistical models and machine learning approaches underpins much of Jin's work, enhancing the understanding of survival rates and health outcomes in both cancer and cardiovascular disease contexts. Overall, Jin's comprehensive research endeavors strive to elucidate critical prognostic factors and improve patient outcomes across these interconnected health spheres.
