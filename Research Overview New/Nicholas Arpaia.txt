Researcher: Nicholas Arpaia
Research Overview:
Nicholas Arpaia's research focuses on the interplay between regulatory T cells (Tregs) and various disease processes, particularly non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, and bladder cancer. He investigates the mechanisms of insulin resistance, the role of gut microbiota, and the effects of nutrient deficiencies, such as tryptophan metabolism, on mucosal immunity. His studies delve into the therapeutic potential of immunotherapy—specifically anti-PD-L1 treatments—and the development of drugs targeting the tumor microenvironment and tertiary lymphoid structures. By exploring the intricate relationships between immune responses, inflammation, and metabolic disorders, Arpaia contributes significant insights into the modulation of immune tolerance and therapeutic strategies in cancer and metabolic diseases. His comprehensive approach bridges immunology and metabolism, shedding light on the factors influencing disease progression and therapeutic efficacy.
