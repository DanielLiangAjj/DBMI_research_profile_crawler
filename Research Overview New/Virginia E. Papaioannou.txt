Researcher: Virginia E. Papaioannou
Research Overview:
Virginia E. Papaioannou's research primarily focuses on the developmental biology of pluripotent stem cells, particularly embryonic stem (ES) cells and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, as well as their capacity for gene manipulation and lineage tracing. Key themes include the study of T-box transcription factors, especially Tbx6 and T-bra, in relation to axis determination and left-right asymmetry during mouse development. Her work employs advanced techniques such as CRISPR-Cas systems for gene targeting and knockout strategies to explore gene function in mammalian development. Moreover, her investigations extend to the dynamics of cell fate decisions within the endothelium, trophoblasts, and the placenta, with implications for gestational challenges like preeclampsia. Papaioannou incorporates clonal analysis, mutational phenotype assessments, and embryos to establish the role of various signaling pathways in organogenesis and cellular differentiation. Overall, her extensive research contributes significantly to the understanding of developmental processes, potential fertility implications, and the genetic underpinnings of various biological systems in mammals.
