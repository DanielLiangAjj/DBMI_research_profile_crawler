Researcher: Vincent P. Ferrera
Research Overview:
Vincent P. Ferrera's research delves into the intricate interactions of neurological mechanisms governing cognition, decision-making, and learning processes, primarily using non-human primate models. His work explores advanced methodologies like focused ultrasound and optogenetics in manipulating brain networks, enabling the investigation of the blood-brain barrier and its implications for drug delivery and neuromodulation. Ferrera's studies frequently employ resting-state functional MRI and electrophysiological techniques to evaluate functional connectivity within neural circuits underlying cognitive tasks, including serial and transitive inference, categorization, and reward-based learning. Key findings involve behavioral responses to risk, error detection, and performance monitoring, which contribute to understanding the neural substrates of cognitive control and motivation. Overall, his research significantly enhances our comprehension of how various brain regions, like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, interact in shaping decision-making and cognitive processes, thus advancing the field of neuroscience and its application in understanding human and animal behavior.
