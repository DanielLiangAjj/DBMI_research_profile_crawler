Researcher: Stefano Fusi
Research Overview:
Stefano Fusi's research focuses on understanding the complex dynamics of neural circuits and their role in cognition and memory through a variety of methods, including computational modeling, neuroscience techniques, and behavioral studies. His work emphasizes diverse themes such as neural coding, mixed selectivity, neuromodulation, and the hippocampus' influence on memory formation, recognition, and social behaviors. He investigates how neuronal dynamics—including oscillations, population coding, and synaptic plasticity—contribute to cognitive functions such as spatial navigation, abstraction, and decision-making. Leveraging advanced techniques like calcium imaging and neural network models, Fusi aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of memory systems, exploring how neural representations and distributed processing lead to effective memory recall and recognition, while also addressing concepts like forgetting, learning, and the gating of information within neural circuits. Overall, his interdisciplinary approach bridges neural dynamics with cognitive processes, offering insights into the principles governing learning and memory in both animal models and human cognition.
