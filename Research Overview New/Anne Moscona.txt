Researcher: Anne Moscona
Research Overview:
Anne Mosconaâ€™s research primarily focuses on the mechanisms of viral entry and fusion, particularly in relation to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and members of the Paramyxoviridae family, including the parainfluenza virus. Utilizing advanced techniques like cryo-electron tomography, her studies have elucidated the role of viral fusion proteins, including the spike protein of coronaviruses, in mediating membrane fusion and viral entry into host cells. The work also investigates the evolutionary dynamics of these viruses and their interactions with human immune responses, particularly post-vaccine sera, as well as exploring fusion inhibitors and other antiviral agents as potential therapeutic strategies against these pathogens. Overall, her contributions significantly advance the understanding of viral pathogenesis and the development of antiviral therapies.
