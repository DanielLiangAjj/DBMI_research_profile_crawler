Researcher: Filippo Mancia
Research Overview:
Filippo Manciaâ€™s research focuses predominantly on the structural biology and functional characterization of membrane proteins, particularly those involved in various biological transport processes. His work extensively utilizes advanced techniques such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography to elucidate the structural dynamics of integral membrane proteins, including glycosyltransferases, acyl carrier proteins, and multidrug resistance transporters. Through high-throughput biology methods, he aims to unlock the mechanisms behind sugar transfer, cell wall biosynthesis, and the secretion and signaling pathways of Wnt proteins, with significant implications for understanding infectious diseases like tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His exploration of lipid modifications, such as palmitoleation, and the impact of membrane compositions, including the use of amphipols and nanodiscs, further contributes to the knowledge of protein interactions and drug resistance mechanisms. Overall, Mancia's research integrates structural genomics and biophysics to advance our understanding of critical biological processes, paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions.
