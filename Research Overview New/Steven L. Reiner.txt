Researcher: Steven L. Reiner
Research Overview:
Steven L. Reiner's research encompasses a broad range of topics related to T cell biology, cancer immunotherapy, and the complex signaling pathways that govern immune cell differentiation and metabolism. His investigations delve into the roles of CD8(+) T cells, particularly in terms of self-renewal and asymmetric cell division, and the impact of various molecular players such as PD-1, PI3K, mTOR, and TCF1 on T cell fate and function. Reiner explores the tumor microenvironment's influence on immune responses, with particular emphasis on gastric cancer and the efficacy of novel therapies like CAR T cells and CAR NK cells, as well as antibody-drug conjugates and immune checkpoint inhibitors. His work highlights the interplay between metabolic pathways, such as the Warburg effect, and signaling mechanisms involved in lymphocyte activation, differentiation, and memory, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies for enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Overall, his research significantly contributes to our understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying immune responses in both homeostasis and disease contexts.
