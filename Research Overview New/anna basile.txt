Researcher: anna basile
Research Overview:
Anna Basile's research spans a wide range of topics primarily focused on cancer biology, drug responses, and neurological disorders. Notably, her work on KRAS isoforms and the p.G12C mutation explores implications for targeted therapies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, particularly with the use of sotorasib and monoclonal antibodies. She also investigates the role of the tumor microenvironment, specifically the impact of BAG3 and cytokines on cell signaling and apoptosis. Her interests extend to the intersection of machine learning and pharmacovigilance, where she analyzes adverse drug reactions and genetic associations in complex traits, employing electronic health records and advanced computational models. Additionally, her work on SARS-CoV-2 has shed light on virus entry mechanisms and the immune response, contributing to the understanding of COVID-19. Basile's comprehensive approach integrates molecular biology, clinical research, and artificial intelligence, establishing her as a key figure in advancing precision medicine and therapeutic strategies for various diseases, including cancer and neurological conditions.
