Researcher: Stephen P. Goff
Research Overview:
Stephen P. Goff's research primarily revolves around the intricate roles of histones and their modifications in the context of viral infections, particularly focusing on retroviruses such as HIV-1 and Moloney murine leukemia virus. He has extensively investigated histone dynamics, including modifications and deposition processes that contribute to transcriptional silencing of unintegrated retroviral DNAs. His work highlights the influence of histone variants, linker histones, and chromatin remodeling factors in shaping gene expression and host immune responses. Goff's research also emphasizes the interactions between viral proteins and host factors like zinc finger antiviral proteins, revealing critical insights into antiviral mechanisms and retroviral restrictions. Overall, his contributions have significantly advanced our understanding of the molecular interplay between host chromatin environment and viral replication, with implications for developing innovative strategies against retroviral infections and understanding the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.
