Researcher: Iva S. Greenwald
Research Overview:
Iva S. Greenwald's research primarily focuses on various aspects of developmental biology utilizing the model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans* (C. elegans). Her studies delve into the signaling pathways involved in cell fate specification, particularly highlighting the roles of Notch, EGFR, and Ras signaling in processes such as vulval development and gonadogenesis. This includes investigating the molecular mechanisms that underpin stochastic cell fate decisions and the regulatory networks governing germline development and sexual dimorphism. Greenwald employs a variety of genetic and biochemical techniques to manipulate gene expression, including conditional gene expression and RNA interference, to explore feedback mechanisms in signal transduction, protein degradation pathways, and the impact of bHLH transcription factors on cell differentiation and lineage. Her work integrates a phylogenetic approach, linking findings from C. elegans to broader evolutionary contexts, and contributes significantly to our understanding of organogenesis and cell fate reprogramming. Overall, her research advances the knowledge of developmental processes and signaling dynamics in multicellular organisms, with implications for understanding related mechanisms in higher organisms, including humans.
