Researcher: Virginia Cornish
Research Overview:
Virginia Cornish's research focuses on the intersection of yeast biology, synthetic biology, and molecular diagnostics, with a strong emphasis on the use of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and *Saccharomyces boulardii*. Her work explores the molecular mechanisms of protein interactions, ribosomal function, and gene expression regulation, particularly in relation to efflux pumps and G-protein coupled receptors, which are crucial in understanding invasive fungal infections and the development of low-cost diagnostic tools. Key highlights of her research include the application of high-throughput screening methods, yeast three-hybrid assay, and advanced imaging techniques, such as live-cell fluorescence microscopy, to study molecular recognition, protein-protein interactions, and the behavior of peptide biomarkers. Cornish has also contributed to the field of biochemistry through her investigations into metabolic engineering and translation processes, utilizing synthetic biology approaches to design innovative biosensors for rapid point-of-care testing. Her multidisciplinary approach not only advances our understanding of fungal pathogens but also enhances the potential for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against infectious diseases.
