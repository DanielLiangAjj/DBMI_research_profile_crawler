Researcher: Jacqueline Gottlieb
Research Overview:
Jacqueline Gottlieb's research significantly contributes to our understanding of the interplay between cognitive processes and neural mechanisms associated with decision-making, curiosity, and information-seeking behavior. Through a multi-faceted approach, her work explores the roles of uncertainty and motivation in driving exploration and attention, as evidenced by findings from both human neuroimaging and monkey physiology studies. Key themes in her research include meta reinforcement learning, visual attention, and active sensing, emphasizing how intrinsic motivations and curiosity influence decision-making processes and the resulting eye movements, or saccades. Gottlieb's investigations, which encompass behavioral experiments and advanced machine learning techniques, not only delve into the neural substrates involving various brain regions such as the prefrontal and parietal lobes but also address broader cognitive constructs such as superstitious learning and transitive inference. Overall, her research enhances our comprehension of how cognitive and neural mechanisms orchestrate exploratory behavior, ultimately shaping an organism's interactions with its environment in the presence of uncertainty.
