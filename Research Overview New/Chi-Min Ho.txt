Researcher: Chi-Min Ho
Research Overview:
Chi-Min Ho's research focuses on the intersection of parasitology and advanced imaging techniques, particularly cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). His work primarily investigates the structural biology of *Plasmodium falciparum*, the malaria-causing parasite, through innovative approaches like in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) and endogenous structural proteomics. Keywords such as "new PI" and "starting a new lab" highlight his transition into independent research, while terms like "malaria," "trafficking," and "cell membrane permeability" indicate a deep exploration of the parasite's interactions with host cells. Utilizing methodologies such as mass spectrometry and computer-assisted image processing, Ho's research aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying malaria pathogenesis and the structural dynamics of protozoan proteins. Overall, his contributions significantly enhance our understanding of host-parasite interactions and potential therapeutic targets in malaria research.
