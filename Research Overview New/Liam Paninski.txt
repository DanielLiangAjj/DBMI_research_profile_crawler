Researcher: Liam Paninski
Research Overview:
Liam Paninski's research predominantly focuses on advanced neuroscience techniques, particularly in the realm of calcium imaging and the analysis of neural dynamics within various model organisms, such as mice and primates. Employing innovative methods like two-photon microscopy and microendoscopy, his work leverages open-source software and Bayesian algorithms for effective source extraction and demixing of neural signals. A significant aspect of his research involves the use of GCaMP sensors to investigate the activity of neurons, including those in apical dendrites and the barrel cortex, facilitating studies on synaptic transmission and connectivity mapping. His findings extend to behavioral correlates, such as responses to rewards and motor activities, utilizing optogenetics and other techniques to explore neural pathways and synaptic efficiency. Through meticulous statistical modeling and computational biology approaches, Paninski aims to enhance our understanding of neural circuitry and its implications for cognitive processes, ultimately contributing to the broader fields of neurophysiology and machine learning in neuroscience.
