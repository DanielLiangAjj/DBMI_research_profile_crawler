Researcher: Anna-Lena Steckelberg
Research Overview:
Anna-Lena Steckelberg's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of RNA biology, particularly in relation to post-translational modifications and host-virus interactions. Her work encompasses a range of topics, including the roles of ADP-ribosyltransferases, NAD-capping, and RNAylation in bacteriophage biology and the regulation of translation during viral infections, such as those caused by SARS-CoV-2. Utilizing advanced methodologies like X-ray crystallography and single-molecule FRET, she investigates RNA structure dynamics, exoribonuclease resistance, and the complexities of RNA splicing and maturation in both viral and host systems. Her research also delves into the functional aspects of viral RNAs, including subgenomic flavivirus RNA and noncoding RNAs, as well as the molecular interactions facilitated by RNA-binding proteins and the exon junction complex. By exploring these interconnected areas, Steckelberg aims to uncover critical insights into gene expression and host-pathogen interactions, providing a deeper understanding of viral mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.
