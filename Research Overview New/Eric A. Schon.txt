Researcher: Eric A. Schon
Research Overview:
Eric A. Schon's research primarily investigates the relationship between mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly focusing on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. His work emphasizes the crucial roles of mitochondrial dynamics, cholesterol, phospholipids, and endoplasmic reticulum interactions, which underscore the importance of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) in cellular health. Schon examines how disruptions in these processes can contribute to neurodegeneration, driven by factors like oxidative stress, amyloid formation, and mitochondrial DNA mutations. His findings on cholesterol's role in these interactions and its effects on neuronal health provide insights into potential therapeutic targets to combat disorders linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid metabolism, paving the way for future research in neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and novel treatment strategies.
