Researcher: Dimitris Anastassiou
Research Overview:
Dimitris Anastassiou's research encompasses an integrated analysis of cancer by leveraging advanced computational biology techniques and single-cell analysis to explore the interplay between gene expression, methylation, and microRNA in various neoplasms. Utilizing tools such as RNA-Seq and genomic databases, his work focuses on understanding the molecular underpinnings of tumor microenvironments, including the roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts and adipose tissue interactions. His studies extend to gene regulatory networks and epigenetic changes that contribute to neoplastic invasiveness and disease progression, with insights contributing to prognostic biomarkers and treatment outcomes in various cancers, including breast, pancreatic, and brain neoplasms. Anastassiouâ€™s interdisciplinary approach combines data mining, statistical modeling, and machine learning algorithms to enhance the understanding of genetic heterogeneity and inform therapeutic strategies, with a strong emphasis on improving survival rates and patient prognosis.
