Researcher: Alberto Ciccia
Research Overview:
Dr. Alberto Ciccia's research centers around the intricate mechanisms of DNA damage response and repair, particularly in the context of cancer biology and genetics. Utilizing advanced techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 and base editing, his work delves into the regulation of pivotal proteins and genes like BRCA1, BRCA2, and JUN to explore their roles in homologous recombination, replication stress, and genomic stability. He investigates the interplay between cancer-intrinsic innate immunity, DNA damage, and cancer therapeutics, with an emphasis on synthetic lethality and translesion synthesis processes. His findings contribute to a better understanding of PD-L1 regulation and the cGAS-STING pathway, thus revealing potential avenues for innovative cancer immunotherapies. Through genome-wide analyses, he aims to establish clinically relevant biomarkers, enhancing precision genome editing approaches that may improve therapeutic strategies and outcomes for breast and ovarian cancer patients.
