Researcher: Jingyue Ju
Research Overview:
Jingyue Ju's research focuses on the interaction between RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) and various antiviral agents in the context of coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2. A significant portion of her work investigates nucleotide analogues and exonucleases, aiming to develop novel antiviral therapies for COVID-19, including drug repositioning and drug synergy approaches. Moreover, her studies utilize advanced sequencing techniques such as DNA sequencing by synthesis and nanopore technology to analyze viral RNA and investigate the mechanisms of viral replication and mutation. Through her comprehensive exploration of viral nonstructural proteins and their functions, she contributes valuable insights into the molecular architecture of coronaviruses and seeks effective treatment strategies against COVID-19. Overall, Ju's research represents a substantial effort to enhance the understanding of viral mechanics and promotes innovative therapeutic avenues in the ongoing fight against coronaviruses.
