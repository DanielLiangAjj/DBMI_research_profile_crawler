Researcher: Gamze Gürsoy
Research Overview:
Gamze Gürsoy's research is predominantly focused on the intersection of genomics, privacy, and computational techniques aimed at enhancing data security and sharing in sensitive areas such as health and genetics. Her work delves into genotype-phenotype associations, leveraging advanced methodologies such as machine learning, federated learning, and blockchain to fortify genomic data privacy against information leakage and linkage attacks. By implementing privacy-preserving technologies like homomorphic encryption and smart contracts, she addresses the challenges surrounding personal genome data, particularly in the context of renal transplantation and opportunistic infections like Cystoisospora belli. Furthermore, her investigations into pharmacogenomics highlight the significance of secure data storage and ethical information dissemination practices within genomic databases, while also contributing to functional genomics and RNA sequencing analyses. Overall, Gürsoy's multifaceted approach not only promotes genetic research but also champions the critical need for confidentiality and secure handling of genomic data in an increasingly data-driven landscape.
