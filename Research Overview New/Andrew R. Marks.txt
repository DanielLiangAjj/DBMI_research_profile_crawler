Researcher: Andrew R. Marks
Research Overview:
Andrew R. Marks' research primarily focuses on the interplay of calcium signaling and ion channels, particularly concerning the ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium release channel, with implications for cardiovascular health and disease. His work employs advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and electrophysiology to investigate the structural and functional dynamics of calcium channels in a variety of contexts, including heart failure, muscular dystrophy, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Marks has explored how calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum impacts excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac and skeletal muscle, contributing to our understanding of conditions like arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. His comprehensive investigations on genetic mutations, oxidative stress, and their association with calcium dysregulation pave the way for novel therapeutic targets for heart diseases and other calcium-related disorders. Overall, Marks' contributions significantly advance the understanding of calcium signaling mechanisms in physiology and pathology, potentially transforming therapeutic approaches in cardiology and neurobiology.
