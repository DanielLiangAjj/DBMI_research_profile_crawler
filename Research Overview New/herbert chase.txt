Researcher: herbert chase
Research Overview:
Herbert Chase's research focuses on the complexities of polypharmacy and the associated risks of adverse drug events (ADEs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs), particularly in older populations such as those with dementia or delirium. His work emphasizes the importance of appropriate prescribing patterns and the challenges presented by off-label drug use. By utilizing advanced technologies such as natural language processing and machine learning, Chase explores how electronic health records (EHRs) can improve the diagnosis and management of multimorbidity among geriatric patients. His studies investigate the intersection of medication management and patient outcomes, particularly during critical periods like the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight the role of healthcare quality control in mitigating risks associated with complex drug therapies. Through analyses of data from various cohorts and retrospective studies, Chase addresses the prevalence of drug-related side effects and emphasizes the necessity for effective interventions to enhance patient safety in clinical settings. Overall, his research contributes significantly to understanding and improving medication practices in aging populations, particularly in the context of existing health care challenges.
