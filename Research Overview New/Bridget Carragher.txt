Researcher: Bridget Carragher
Research Overview:
Bridget Carragher's research focuses on advancing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and its applications to structural biology, particularly in the context of understanding complex protein structures and interactions. This includes utilizing high-throughput automation and machine learning to enhance cryo-EM workflows, enabling near-atomic resolution imaging and facilitating integrative structural biology. Her work emphasizes the democratization of these advanced techniques to promote widespread accessibility, especially in the study of SARS-CoV-2 and related viral structures for drug development. Additionally, Carragher explores innovative specimen preparation methods and computational tools for image processing, bridging the gap between structural proteomics and drug discovery. Overall, her contributions are pivotal in refining structural analysis methods, fostering collaboration in the field, and paving the way for new therapeutic approaches through structure-based drug design.
