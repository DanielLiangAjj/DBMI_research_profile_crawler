Researcher: Donna Farber
Research Overview:
Donna Farberâ€™s research primarily focuses on various aspects of human immunology, particularly regarding T cells and their roles in adaptive and innate immunity. Her work encompasses developmental immunity throughout various life stages, including infant and aging immunity, and delves into the complexities of mucosal and tissue-resident memory T cells. Farber's studies highlight the interactions between T lymphocytes and other immune cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes, as well as their involvement in anti-viral responses against pathogens like cytomegalovirus and influenza. Her use of advanced techniques, including single-cell RNA sequencing, has allowed her to explore the nuances of immune cell trafficking and tissue homing, shedding light on immune memory formation and immunopathology in contexts such as ARDS and COVID-19. In summary, Farber's work significantly contributes to our understanding of immune system dynamics, disease susceptibility, and the potential for therapeutic interventions in diverse immunological conditions.
