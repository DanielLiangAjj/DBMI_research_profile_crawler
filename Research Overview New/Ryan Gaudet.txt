Researcher: Ryan Gaudet
Research Overview:
Ryan Gaudet's research focuses on the interactions between various pathogens, particularly Helicobacter pylori, Shigella, and their associated molecular patterns, such as CagA and TIFA. His work extensively examines innate immunity responses mediated by NOD-like receptors and the roles of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in inflammation and infection processes. Additionally, Gaudet's studies delve into microbial viability, coinfection scenarios, and the intricate signaling pathways involving immune response mechanisms, including NF-kappa B and the involvement of various cell types like macrophages and epithelial cells. Through a combination of molecular techniques and immunological models, his research seeks to elucidate the host-pathogen dynamics that underpin infectious diseases, including sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea and complications associated with HIV, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of innate immunity and the potential for therapeutic interventions.
