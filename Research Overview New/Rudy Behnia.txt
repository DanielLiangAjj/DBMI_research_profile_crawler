Researcher: Rudy Behnia
Research Overview:
Rudy Behnia's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of color vision and motion perception in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, leveraging advanced techniques such as two-photon microscopy and nonlinear optimization to explore neural circuits and connectomes associated with visual pathways. His work emphasizes the physiological role of photoreceptors and interneurons in color opponency and direction selectivity, while investigating the neuromodulatory influences of octopamine on visual processing. Behnia's findings contribute significantly to our understanding of sensory circuits, including the dynamics of calcium signaling in neuronal dendrites and synapses, and highlight the evolutionary conservation of visual mechanisms across species. Overall, his research integrates behavioral studies with molecular and physiological approaches to unravel the complexities of visual perception in insects and its broader implications for neuroscience.
