Researcher: Gwyneth Card
Research Overview:
Gwyneth Card's research primarily focuses on the neuroethology of Drosophila melanogaster, exploring the neural circuits and mechanisms underlying decision-making and behavior, particularly in escape responses. Utilizing high-speed video and machine vision, her work investigates how these insects process visual stimuli, such as looming threats, through a detailed analysis of their neural architecture and functional connectivity, including visual projection neurons and the giant fiber escape pathway. By integrating techniques like in vivo electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and optogenetics, her studies reveal insights into sensorimotor integration, action selection, and the developmental biology of neuronal lineages. Overall, Card's contributions significantly enhance our understanding of visual computation and behavioral responses in Drosophila, thereby providing a foundational framework for future studies in neuroscience and animal behavior.
