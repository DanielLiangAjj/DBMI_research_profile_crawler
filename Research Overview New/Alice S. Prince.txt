Researcher: Alice S. Prince
Research Overview:
Alice S. Prince's research focuses on the complex interplay between host immune responses and bacterial pathogens, particularly in the context of respiratory infections. Her studies emphasize the role of neutrophils and their oxidative burst capabilities, as well as the metabolic adaptations that occur during infections with pathogens such as *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. Key themes include the involvement of NADPH oxidase in neutrophil function and the immunometabolic effects of compounds like itaconate and succinate in regulating inflammation and bacterial persistence. Additionally, her work addresses the mechanisms of pathogenesis in pneumonia, the implications of bacterial toxins, and the host-pathogen interactions that shape disease outcomes, including in conditions of chronic inflammation such as cystic fibrosis and malaria. Overall, Prince's research contributes significant insights into the mechanisms of immunological responses to bacterial infections, with potential implications for developing therapeutic strategies against antibiotic-resistant infections and enhancing host defenses.
