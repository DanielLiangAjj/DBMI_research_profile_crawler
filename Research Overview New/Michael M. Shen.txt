Researcher: Michael M. Shen
Research Overview:
Michael M. Shen's research focuses on the complex interplay of cellular states, tumor biology, and regenerative processes, particularly within the context of prostate cancer. His extensive work on organoids and genetically engineered mouse models elucidates the mechanisms of tumor heterogeneity, lineage plasticity, and cancer progression, emphasizing the role of the tumor microenvironment and the cancer stem cell niche. A significant aspect of his investigation includes understanding how prostate organogenesis and interactions involving stem cells can influence therapeutic resistance, particularly to androgen receptor signaling and endocrine therapies. By employing advanced techniques such as lineage tracing and single-cell analysis, Shen's studies contribute to a nuanced understanding of tumor initiation, differentiation, and the clonal evolution of prostate and bladder cancers. His findings not only offer insights into the biological underpinnings of cancer but also pave the way for innovative strategies in regenerative medicine and precision oncology.
