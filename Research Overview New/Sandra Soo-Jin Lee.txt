Research Overview:
Sandra Soo-Jin Lee's research encompasses a wide range of critical themes at the intersection of biomedical research, genetics, and bioethics, with a strong focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Her work examines the complexities of race and ethnicity within the realms of precision medicine, genetic testing, and healthcare disparities. Lee emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in research participation, including informed consent, community engagement, and the return of results, advocating for equitable practices in biomedical and behavioral research. Her multidisciplinary approach incorporates insights from sociology, anthropology, and public health to address biases and promote justice in research efforts. Furthermore, she critiques the commercialization of genetic services and the ethical implications of direct-to-consumer testing, while fostering knowledge brokering to enhance the dissemination of research findings. Overall, Lee's contributions to research ethics, education, and health equity aim to bridge gaps in understanding and access for underrepresented populations, ultimately striving to create a more just and inclusive healthcare environment.
