Researcher: Chaolin Zhang
Research Overview:
Chaolin Zhang's research significantly enhances the understanding of alternative splicing and its implications in cancer and neurobiology. His work primarily revolves around the role of RNA-binding proteins and splicing factors in regulating RNA splicing, influencing protein activity, and contributing to tumorigenesis, particularly in breast cancer. Zhang utilizes advanced computational biology methods, including machine learning and high-throughput analyses, to infer complex regulatory networks and predict splice site usage, thereby identifying splicing-altering mutations linked to various tumors. Furthermore, his studies on neuronal development and disorders explore how alternative splicing shapes neuronal subtype diversity and affects the pathophysiology of conditions like autism and tauopathies. By integrating molecular evolution insights and data-driven approaches, Zhangâ€™s research not only fosters a deeper comprehension of RNA biology but also holds promise for therapeutic advancements in oncology and neurodevelopmental disorders.
