Researcher: Jane Dodd
Research Overview:
Jane Dodd's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics within developmental biology and neuroscience, notably utilizing model organisms such as the flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius) to explore intricate processes related to embryonic development. Her work investigates the influence of environmental factors such as temperature and salinity on the growth and differentiation of embryos, emphasizing mechanisms like chemotaxis and growth cone dynamics in neuronal development. Additionally, Dodd's studies delve into molecular signaling pathways involving Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and their receptors, as well as the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in cellular communication and differentiation. By integrating methodologies such as advanced microscopy, histological techniques, and genetic manipulation, her research aims to enhance understanding of neural tissue development and regeneration, contributing valuable insights to the fields of developmental and regenerative biology.
