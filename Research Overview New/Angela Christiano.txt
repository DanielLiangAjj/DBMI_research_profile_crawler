Researcher: Angela Christiano
Research Overview:
Angela Christiano's research focus is centered on the intersection of immunology, genetics, and dermatology, particularly concerning autoimmune skin disorders like alopecia areata (AA). Significant themes in her work include the role of T cells and their regulation within the hair follicle microenvironment, exploring mechanisms such as T cell exhaustion and the influence of JAK-STAT signaling pathways. She employs advanced techniques, including single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, to investigate genetic predispositions and the underlying autoimmune processes involved in hair loss. Additionally, Christiano is dedicated to translational research aimed at enhancing patient outcomes through personalized medicine strategies, incorporating artificial intelligence for drug prediction and the development of combination therapies. Her multidisciplinary approach integrates systems biology and bioengineering to create in vitro models, such as skin-on-a-chip systems, facilitating the testing of novel therapies and studying inflammatory responses related to hair disorders. Through her work, she aims to optimize therapeutic strategies, improve quality of life for patients with alopecia areata, and ultimately advance our understanding of the genetic and immunological factors contributing to hair loss.
