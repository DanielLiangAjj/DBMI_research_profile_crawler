Researcher: Kristin K. Baldwin
Research Overview:
Kristin K. Baldwin's research centers on advancing our understanding of developmental biology and regenerative medicine, particularly through the use of pluripotent stem cells and interspecies chimeras. Her work explores complex topics such as blastocyst complementation, brain evolution, and brain regeneration, with a focus on neuronal diversity and the intricate neural circuits that underlie olfactory perception. Baldwin employs cutting-edge techniques, including genome editing and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to create disease models for cardiovascular conditions and neurodegenerative diseases. Her investigations extend to the molecular mechanisms of gene regulatory networks and transcription factors in various cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells and neurons. By leveraging cellular reprogramming and direct transdifferentiation, her research aims to bridge the gap between basic science and therapeutic applications, fostering new paradigms in regenerative medicine and offering insights into the treatment of complex diseases.
