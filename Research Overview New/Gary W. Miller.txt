Researcher: Gary W. Miller
Research Overview:
Gary W. Miller's research is centered on the complex interplay between environmental exposures, neurotoxic mechanisms, and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly focusing on disorders like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. His work employs advanced methodologies such as high-resolution mass spectrometry and metabolomics to explore the exposome—an individual's total environmental exposures—and its implications for health. The research encompasses a broad spectrum of chemical substances, including air pollutants, pesticides, and neurotoxins like methamphetamine and MPTP, and their roles in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. By utilizing both targeted and non-targeted analyses, Miller aims to elucidate biomarker profiles associated with neurodegenerative diseases, assessing how environmental factors and aging interact to impact neural health. His contributions also bridge clinical and preclinical research, employing animal models to investigate underlying mechanisms of disease, ultimately striving toward improved understanding and mitigation of risks associated with environmental toxicants in aging populations.
