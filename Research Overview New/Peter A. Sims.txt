Researcher: Peter A. Sims
Research Overview:
Peter A. Sims’ research encompasses a multidisciplinary approach focusing on cancer biology, particularly in glioblastoma and glioma, as well as neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. His work employs advanced methodologies including single-cell genomics, multiplexed lineage tracing, and proteomics to investigate tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance mechanisms, and translational regulation in both human and mouse models. Exploring the roles of mitotic kinesins and local translation within cancer cells, his lab utilizes cutting-edge techniques such as fluorescence-guided surgery, ribosome profiling, and high-throughput sequencing to analyze gene expression and the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, his investigations into dopaminergic neurons contribute to our understanding of neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in relation to conditions like fragile X syndrome. Overall, Dr. Sims’ research aims to unravel the complexities of cell biology and oncology, paving the way for precision medicine and novel therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment and neurobiology.
