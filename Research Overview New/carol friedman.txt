Research Overview:
Carol Friedman's research predominantly revolves around the use of crowdsourcing for data collection in health care, primarily focusing on electronic health records (EHRs) and various dimensions of personalized and precision medicine. Key themes within her work include assessing prescribing patterns, understanding pharmacogenomics, and addressing polypharmacy issues in the elderly. She employs advanced methodologies, notably natural language processing (NLP), to enhance the quality of data mining and risk assessment in health care. Additionally, her studies explore the implications of privacy, the appropriateness of drug therapy, and the management of drug interactions and adverse reactions through a combination of case-control studies, cohort studies, and case series. By integrating pharmacovigilance and considering confounding factors in health care quality control, Friedman aims to promote better patient outcomes and safety measures. Overall, her contributions underscore the importance of leveraging technology and innovative practices in enhancing health care delivery and patient management, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly.
