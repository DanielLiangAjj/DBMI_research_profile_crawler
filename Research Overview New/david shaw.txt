Researcher: david shaw
Research Overview:
David Shaw’s research is deeply rooted in interdisciplinary themes, encompassing legal, ethical, and scientific aspects of animal experimentation and welfare, with particular emphasis on Swiss law. His work critically evaluates animal experimentation practices, emphasizing the '3Rs' principle (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) and the ethical implications surrounding animal dignity and welfare laws. Furthermore, Shaw explores societal concerns about transparency and the role of approval rates and harm-benefit analysis in research oversight. His research extends to genetic enhancements and tissue and organ procurement, delving into the ethics of euthanasia and conditional organ donation linked to autonomy and informed consent. Beyond animal welfare, Shaw's work crosses into applying artificial intelligence in healthcare settings, examining ethical dilemmas arising from AI usage, including decision-making processes defined by shared autonomy in doctor-patient relations. His investigations into environmental and public health ethics, particularly amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect his commitment to integrating ethics within health policies and practices while exploring the implications of emerging technologies and methodologies in research integrity. Shaw’s diverse portfolio underscores a holistic approach to understanding and addressing the ethical frameworks surrounding biology, health, and governance, positioning him as a vital contributor to contemporary discussions on public health and animal rights.
