Researcher: despina kontos
Research Overview:
Despina Kontos has made significant contributions to the field of oncologic imaging, particularly focusing on breast cancer through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and advanced imaging techniques. Her research encompasses a variety of areas including deep learning applications in mammography and MRI, risk assessment models integrating polygenic risk scores, and radiomics for evaluating tumor heterogeneity. Through her studies, she emphasizes the importance of imaging biomarkers and precision medicine, which aim to improve the early detection and prognostication of breast cancer. Her work on deformable image registration and longitudinal imaging contributes to enhanced analysis of treatment responses and tumor changes over time. Additionally, she explores the relationships between breast density, imaging modalities, and genetic factors such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), showcasing how these elements can inform risk-reducing strategies in high-risk populations. Overall, Kontos' research bridges the gap between technology and clinical practice, aiming to advance personalized approaches in breast cancer diagnosis and management.
