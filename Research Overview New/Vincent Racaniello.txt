Researcher: Vincent Racaniello
Research Overview:
Vincent Racaniello's research focuses on the biology and virology of enteroviruses, particularly poliovirus and its associated diseases, including acute flaccid myelitis. His work emphasizes the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis, neurotropism, and host immune responses, investigating both innate immune pathways and the role of various immune cells such as macrophages and astrocytes in controlling viral infections. Racaniello extensively studies viral proteins, receptor interactions, and antigenic variations, employing in vitro techniques and animal models to elucidate virus entry mechanisms and the implications for vaccine development. His contributions to understanding the dynamics of picornaviruses, including their evolution and interaction with the human immune system, underscore the importance of this research in combating viral diseases, especially in vulnerable populations like infants and children. Additionally, through educational outreach and media efforts such as podcasting, he conveys the significance of virology to the public and scientific communities.
