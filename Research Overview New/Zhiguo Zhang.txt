Researcher: Zhiguo Zhang
Research Overview:
Zhiguo Zhang's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily centered around cellular processes, metabolic pathways, and neurobiological mechanisms. A significant focus is placed on ferroptosis and its implications in various disease contexts, such as ischemic stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis, indicating a keen interest in the relationship between cellular stress responses and chronic conditions. Zhang has explored the role of adipose-derived stem cells and exosomes in regenerative medicine and drug delivery systems, while also delving into innovative therapeutic approaches involving natural compounds like icariin. The incorporation of modern computational techniques, including machine learning and bioinformatics, reflects a commitment to integrating technology with biological research for enhanced understanding of complex biological systems and disease mechanisms. Additionally, Zhang's work on neuroimaging and neurofeedback indicates an exploration of cognitive functions and emotional processes, aligning with the broader themes of brain health and mental well-being. Through this interdisciplinary approach, Zhang contributes to the understanding of disease pathology and the development of novel therapeutic strategies across multiple health domains.
