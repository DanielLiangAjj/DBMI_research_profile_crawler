Researcher: Elias Issa
Research Overview:
Elias Issa's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationship between neurophysiology and sensory perception, emphasizing the utilization of deep neural networks and advanced neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI to unravel mechanisms of visual and auditory processing in both humans and non-human primates, particularly rhesus macaques. His studies encompass a broad spectrum of topics, including object and face recognition, neural dynamics within the visual cortex and auditory pathways, and the neurological models that underlie these processes. Through comprehensive brain mapping and electrophysiological evaluations, Issa investigates the spatial organization of sensory regions and how they contribute to cognitive functions like visual perception and auditory discrimination, further integrating aspects of sensory neuroscience with the underlying neural networks. His work leverages comparative methods across species to deepen our understanding of brain functions related to vision, hearing, and overall sensory experience, thereby contributing valuable insights to both biological and applied neuroscience.
