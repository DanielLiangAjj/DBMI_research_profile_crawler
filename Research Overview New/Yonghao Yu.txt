Researcher: Yonghao Yu
Research Overview:
Yonghao Yu's research spans a diverse range of biomedical topics, focusing primarily on neurobiology, drug delivery, and cancer biology. A significant part of his work explores the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain and neurocognitive impairment, particularly in the context of postoperative cognitive disorders (POCD) and the effects of general anesthetics like sevoflurane. His studies employ cutting-edge techniques including electroencephalography, molecular motors, and microneedle patches for controlled drug release targeting neuropathic pain and other conditions. Furthermore, his contributions include biochemical studies on the roles of oxidative stress and inflammation in conditions such as sepsis and acute lung injury, revealing the impact of hydrogen therapy and specific signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt and Nrf2 in neuroprotective contexts. Yu also addresses the genetics of cancer, with explorations into breast cancer mechanisms, particularly focusing on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, which play critical roles in DNA damage response. Overall, his interdisciplinary approach combines molecular biology, proteomics, and clinical implications to illuminate therapeutic targets for neuroinflammation, cancer, and recovery from surgical procedures, demonstrating a commitment to advancing understanding and treatment of complex health issues.
