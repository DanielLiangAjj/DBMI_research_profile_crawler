Researcher: Michal Levo
Research Overview:
Michal Levo's research primarily focuses on gene expression regulation and the mechanisms of transcription in both Drosophila and fungal models such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Utilizing techniques such as high-throughput sequencing, quantitative analysis, and single-cell measurements, Levo investigates how transcription factors and enhancer elements interact with chromatin and nucleosome structures to influence gene expression profiles. His work emphasizes the complexities of promoter regions and their regulatory sequences, shedding light on developmental gene regulation and transcriptional activation. By integrating computational biology with experimental approaches, Levo aims to establish a comprehensive gene expression atlas that enhances our understanding of gene regulation dynamics across different biological systems. His findings are crucial for elucidating the genetic underpinnings of embryonic development, stress responses, and broader biological phenomena.
