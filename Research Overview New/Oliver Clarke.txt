Researcher: Oliver Clarke
Research Overview:
Oliver Clarke's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on ion channels, specifically HCN channels and ryanodine receptors, which play crucial roles in calcium signaling and muscle contraction. Utilizing advanced techniques such as cryoelectron microscopy and mass photometry, Clarke investigates the structural and functional dynamics of these membrane proteins, including their stoichiometry and gating mechanisms. His studies delve into the interactions between these ion channels and regulatory proteins like TRIP8b, as well as the implications of calcium release in excitation-contraction coupling within skeletal muscle. Clarke's contributions to molecular dynamics and structural biology extend to understanding the biophysical properties of proteins involved in various biological phenomena, including thyroid hormone synthesis and pathogen interactions, highlighting the interconnectedness of ion channel functionality with cellular processes in both animal models and microbial systems. Thus, his body of work significantly advances the knowledge of ion channel biophysics and their impact on health and disease mechanisms.
