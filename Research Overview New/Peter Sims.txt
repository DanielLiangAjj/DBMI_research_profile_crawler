Researcher: Peter Sims
Research Overview:
Peter Sims's research focuses on pivotal areas within cancer biology, particularly in the context of glioblastoma and glioma, and extends into neuroscience, especially related to dopamine neurons. His work emphasizes the mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer, utilizing advanced techniques such as single-cell genomics, multiplexed lineage tracing, and ribosome profiling. These methodologies allow for an in-depth understanding of tumor heterogeneity, the tumor microenvironment, and the translational regulation of gene expression, which is essential for developing precision medicine strategies. Additionally, Sims explores the interplay between local translation in neurons and broader implications for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinsonâ€™s disease. His studies employ various experimental approaches, including fluorescence-guided surgery and chemical biology, to dissect complex cellular behaviors and to elucidate the pathways contributing to malignancies and neural function. Overall, his research integrates cutting-edge genomic and proteomic technologies to advance understanding of both cancer and neuroscience, aiming to innovate therapeutic strategies and improve patient outcomes.
