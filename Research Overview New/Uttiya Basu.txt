Researcher: Uttiya Basu
Research Overview:
Uttiya Basu's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms underlying B cell biology, with a particular emphasis on aberrant somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, which are critical processes in adaptive immunity and their implications in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma. His work investigates the role of key enzymes like Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and the RNA exosome complex in regulating genomic stability and RNA processing. Through innovative methods such as DRIP-seq and nondenaturing sodium bisulfite probing, Basu explores how long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and methylation states influence gene expression and contribute to immune system function. The integration of molecular biology, immunology, and genetics in his research provides insights into how dysregulation of these processes can lead to developmental diseases and cancer, highlighting the significance of regulatory mechanisms within B cells. Overall, Basu's contributions advance our understanding of immune responses and the potential for novel therapeutic targets in B cell malignancies.
