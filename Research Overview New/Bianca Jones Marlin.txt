Researcher: Bianca Jones Marlin
Research Overview:
Bianca Jones Marlin's research focuses on the interplay of sensory modalities in shaping maternal and parental behaviors in mammals, particularly within the context of auditory and olfactory cues. By examining how these multisensory signals influence behaviors, her work delves into the underlying neural mechanisms and adaptations that facilitate these critical social interactions. With a strong emphasis on animal behavior and neuroscience, her studies incorporate aspects of neurogenesis and the impact of various sensory perceptions on decision-making processes related to parenting. By bridging disciplines and exploring the intricate ways that sensory inputs inform maternal behavior, her research contributes valuable insights into the evolutionary and neurological underpinnings of social behaviors in mammals.
