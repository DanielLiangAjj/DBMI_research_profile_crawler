Research Overview:
Noémie Elhadad's research focuses on the intersection of public health informatics, health equity, and advanced technologies in healthcare, particularly emphasizing the use of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and artificial intelligence in managing and analyzing health information. Her work addresses critical areas such as disease surveillance, the impact of social determinants of health on health inequities, and the optimization of health information exchange. She investigates various health conditions, especially within reproductive health contexts like polycystic ovary syndrome and menstrual health, while also exploring the usability and effectiveness of health technologies, including mobile applications, chatbots, and fitness trackers. Through her comprehensive literature analysis, she addresses the significance of patient-generated health data and electronic health records (EHRs) in enhancing self-management and improving patient-provider partnerships. Ultimately, her research aims to leverage computational methods to improve health outcomes and inform ethical practices in health informatics, thereby promoting a more equitable healthcare system.
