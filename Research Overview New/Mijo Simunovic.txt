Researcher: Mijo Simunovic
Research Overview:
Mijo Simunovic's research primarily focuses on the intricate processes of early embryonic development, emphasizing key stages such as blastulation, gastrulation, and implantation. His work explores the biomechanical aspects of embryo formation and the role of mechanosignaling and mechanotransduction in these processes. By leveraging stem cell embryo models, including blastoids and embryoids, Simunovic investigates the biochemical pathways involved in cell differentiation and tissue mechanics. His studies delve into membrane dynamics, employing advanced techniques like molecular dynamics simulations and coarse-grained modeling to understand membrane shaping, curvature sensing, and endocytosis. Additionally, he examines protein interactions, specifically those involving BAR domain proteins and their influence on cellular organization and membrane traffic. Overall, Simunovic's interdisciplinary approach integrates developmental biology with biophysics, contributing significantly to our understanding of human embryo development and synthetic embryogenesis.
