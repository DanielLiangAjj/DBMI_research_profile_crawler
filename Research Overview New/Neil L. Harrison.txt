Researcher: Neil L. Harrison
Research Overview:
Neil L. Harrison's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily centered around the neurobiological effects of alcohol, COVID-19, and their associated mechanisms. His work on COVID-19 focuses on the underlying coagulopathy, fibrinolysis, and biomarkers like PAI-1 and von Willebrand factor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the implications for thrombosis and blood coagulation disorders. Concurrently, his studies in the realm of alcohol research delve into how alcohol impacts neural circuits within the prefrontal cortexâ€”particularly its influence on interneurons, working memory, and dopamine signaling during adolescence. Using techniques like calcium imaging and electrophysiology, he investigates the roles of GABA and glycine receptors, alongside the modulation of synaptic transmission and neuroinhibition. The integration of genetic models, cellular assays, and physiological measurements has been pivotal in unraveling the cellular mechanisms through which alcohol and viral proteins exert their effects, potentially leading to advancements in treatment strategies for both alcohol use disorders and the neurological aftermath of COVID-19. Thus, Harrison's research contributes significantly to understanding neurovascular health and the biochemical pathways influenced by psychoactive substances in the context of viral infections.
