Researcher: Michael Shadlen
Research Overview:
Michael Shadlen's research focuses extensively on the neuroscience of decision-making, particularly in the context of perceptual judgments and motor responses. His work investigates the processes involved in decision-making, emphasizing the role of neural mechanisms within the parietal cortex, specifically the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). Utilizing advanced methodologies such as multi-neuron recording, optogenetics, and computational modeling, Shadlen explores how factors like evidence accumulation, motion perception, and sensory signals influence choices and reaction times. His studies also delve into the cognitive aspects of decision-making, examining the interactions between working memory, attention, and saccadic eye movements. By integrating insights from both human and non-human primate research, particularly involving Macaca mulatta, Shadlen aims to elucidate the neural computations that underlie flexible behavior and the complexities of cognition, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of choice and judgment in both humans and animals.
