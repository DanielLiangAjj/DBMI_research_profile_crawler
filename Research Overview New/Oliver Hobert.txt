Researcher: Oliver Hobert
Research Overview:
Oliver Hobert's research primarily focuses on the molecular and genetic mechanisms underpinning neuronal development and differentiation, with a particular emphasis on the model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans*. His work explores the roles of transcription factors, homeobox genes, and various signaling pathways in neurogenesis, neuronal identity, and behavior. Through the use of advanced genetic techniques, including CRISPR and RNA interference, Hobert investigates how specific genes and regulatory elements drive neuronal differentiation and contribute to the formation of the connectomeâ€”the complex wiring of neurons in the nervous system. His research also delves into the sex-specific variations in neuronal function and behavior, aiming to understand the genetic basis of these dimorphisms. The integration of molecular biology, developmental biology, and genetics in his studies contributes to a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing nervous system development and function, illustrating the intricate relationship between gene expression and neuronal phenotypes in both normal and pathological states.
