Researcher: Kelley Yan
Research Overview:
Kelley Yan's research primarily focuses on the functions and mechanisms of intestinal stem cells, particularly within the context of the intestinal epithelium. Her work employs advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and time-resolved fate mapping to elucidate the lineage hierarchy and differentiation processes that govern the behavior and regeneration of crypt base columnar cells and transit-amplifying cells. Her studies explore how factors such as the microbiome, dysbiosis, and host-pathogen interactions influence tissue homeostasis, barrier function, and disease states, including Barrett’s esophagus and various forms of esophageal cancer. Additionally, she investigates the role of G-protein-coupled receptors and Wnt signaling pathways in stem cell niches and cellular plasticity. By utilizing 3D organoid systems and RNA-sequencing methodologies, her research aims to advance understanding of gastrointestinal diseases and inform potential therapeutic strategies for regenerative medicine and cancer treatment. Overall, Yan’s work significantly contributes to the fields of gastroenterology, stem cell biology, and the interactions between microbiota and intestinal health.
