Researcher: Arthur Karlin
Research Overview:
Arthur Karlin's research focuses primarily on the mechanisms and interactions of ion channels, particularly those related to calcium and potassium signaling in vascular smooth muscle and other cell types. His work extensively explores the roles of various agents, such as adenosine triphosphate and nitric oxide, in modulating calcium and chloride channels, including large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels. By employing theoretical models and molecular biology techniques, including mutagenesis, protein structure analysis, and confocal microscopy, he delves into the ion channel gating processes and their pharmacological implications. Karlin's studies also cover cellular dynamics in different animal models, emphasizing the physiological and pathological contexts of cardiovascular health. In summary, his research significantly contributes to understanding the molecular underpinnings of ion channel function and their relevance in cardiovascular physiology and potential therapeutic targets.
