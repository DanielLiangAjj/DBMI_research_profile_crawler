Researcher: Nancy Wexler
Research Overview:
Nancy Wexler’s research primarily focuses on the intersection of community health, genetics, and the epidemiology of Huntington's disease. Her work encompasses key themes such as the integration of Community Health Workers within health systems, highlighting issues like recruitment and retention of these essential workforce members. Wexler has extensively studied the genetic aspects of Huntington's disease, particularly the implications of HTT exon 1, mis-splicing associated with the huntingtin protein, and the role of SRSF6 in these processes. Her research also addresses broader public health concerns, including the incidence and prevalence of Huntington's disease in various demographic contexts like the United States, Venezuela, and the United Kingdom. By employing analytical approaches that draw on epidemiology and biomedical research, Wexler advocates for a professional patient relationship and emphasizes the importance of genetic counseling, ethical considerations, and social responsibility in the delivery of healthcare. Overall, her comprehensive body of work contributes significantly to understanding and addressing the complex challenges surrounding Huntington’s disease and its impact on affected communities.
