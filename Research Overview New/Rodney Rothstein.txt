Researcher: Rodney Rothstein
Research Overview:
Rodney Rothstein’s research primarily focuses on the mechanisms of DNA repair, particularly the processes of homologous recombination and the stability of the genome. His studies extensively explore the roles of various proteins—including Rad52, Rad51, Mre11, and others—associated with DNA strand break repair, the formation of R-loops, and the significance of DNA:RNA hybrids. Utilizing techniques such as fluorescence microscopy, Rothstein investigates the dynamics of chromosomal mobility during DNA repair and recombination, particularly in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast). His work emphasizes the intersection of transcription and repair pathways and highlights how defects in these processes can contribute to genetic instability. Additionally, his studies on the regulatory roles of Cyclin-dependent kinases and Polo-like kinases provide insights into checkpoint signaling during the cell cycle, further elucidating the molecular underpinnings of DNA damage responses. Through this comprehensive research, Rothstein advances our understanding of genomic stability and the cellular mechanisms that safeguard the integrity of genetic information.
