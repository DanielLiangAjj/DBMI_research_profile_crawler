Researcher: Shi Du Yan
Research Overview:
Shi Du Yan's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationships among neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, diabetes complications, and their underlying molecular mechanisms involving amyloid beta-peptides, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. The studies examine various cellular and biochemical processes, such as neurotransmission in neurons, gene expression regulation, and the roles of synaptic potentials and mitochondrial functions in maintaining cellular health. With an emphasis on the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), the research explores how RAGE-mediated signaling pathways influence inflammation and oxidative stress in brain tissues and vascular systems. By employing various models, including cultured cells, animal models, and transgenic mice, the work seeks to elucidate drug interactions, neuroprotective strategies, and the cellular responses leading to apoptosis and neurodegeneration. Overall, Yan's research strives not only to deepen the understanding of these complex diseases but also to identify potential therapeutic targets for intervention and prevention.
