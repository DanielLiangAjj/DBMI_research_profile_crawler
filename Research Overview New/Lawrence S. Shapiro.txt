Researcher: Lawrence S. Shapiro
Research Overview:
Lawrence S. Shapiro's research primarily focuses on the mechanisms of vertebrate development, with a particular emphasis on the roles of cadherins and signaling pathways, such as the Wnt signaling pathway, in embryonic patterning and motor neuron development. Utilizing mammalian embryos, specifically mice, his studies explore the impact of mutations on biological evolution and body patterning, as well as the intricate processes of signal transduction within the spinal cord. The implications of his work extend to understanding how these molecular interactions influence the functionality of motor neurons and overall developmental outcomes in vertebrates.
