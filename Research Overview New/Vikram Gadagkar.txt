Researcher: Vikram Gadagkar
Research Overview:
Vikram Gadagkar's research focuses on the intersection of neuroscience and behavioral biology, particularly in the context of motor skill learning and natural behavior as observed in songbirds. His work delves into the dynamics of vocalization and the underlying neural mechanisms involving the basal ganglia and dopaminergic systems, including the ventral tegmental area and the ventral pallidum. By employing models such as Gaussian processes and generalized linear models, he investigates how dopamine influences performance prediction, motivation, and skill maintenance during birdsong. Through the use of various experimental techniques including electrophysiology and behavior analysis, Gadagkar aims to elucidate the physiological feedback processes that govern learning, communication, and reward mechanisms in animals, contributing to a broader understanding of neural pathways linked to both learning and innate behavior in species such as finches. His findings integrate fundamental neuroscience with applications that could extend to broader contexts, linking neural activity to behavior and learning processes.
