Researcher: David Sulzer
Research Overview:
David Sulzer's research primarily focuses on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. His work delves into the roles of dopaminergic neurons, α-synuclein, neuroinflammation, and the adaptive immune response, particularly the involvement of CD4(+) T cells and their associated HLA-DRB1(∗)15:01 alleles. Sulzer employs a multidisciplinary approach that includes computational neuroscience, behavioral neuroscience, and electrochemical techniques, such as fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, to investigate synaptic transmission and dopamine signaling within various brain regions, notably the striatum and basal ganglia. His studies also explore the effects of autophagy in protein homeostasis and the degeneration of neuronal pathways, aiming to understand the cellular mechanisms that contribute to motor deficits, neurotoxicity, and inflammation in models of Parkinson's disease. Overall, his work bridges the gap between the biological sciences and clinical outcomes, advancing our understanding of neurodegeneration and potential therapeutic targets.
