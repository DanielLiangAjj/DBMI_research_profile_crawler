Researcher: Jeremy Worley
Research Overview:
Jeremy Worley's research focuses on the molecular and ecological aspects of fungal pathogens, particularly those affecting snakes, such as *Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola*. His work encompasses the study of aleuriospores and arthrospores, utilizing molecular phylogenetics to understand the evolutionary relationships within the Ascomycota phylum. Worley's studies integrate high-throughput screening methods and yeast knock-out collections to explore gene expression regulation and the effects of environmental stressors like osmotic pressure and oxidative stress on fungal behavior. Notably, he investigates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) and its role in signal transduction and gene regulatory networks, contributing to the broader understanding of mycoses in animals. Through a combination of genetic manipulation techniques, genome-wide association studies, and physiological stress responses, Worley's research aims to elucidate the complexities of fungal genomics and their implications for wildlife health, particularly in snake populations.
