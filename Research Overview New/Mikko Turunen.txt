Researcher: Mikko Turunen
Research Overview:
Mikko Turunen's research primarily focuses on cancer systems biology, with a particular emphasis on breast and colorectal cancers. His work encompasses various aspects of tumor biology, including the roles of key molecular players such as TRPS1, p53, Myc, and RhoA, as well as cellular processes like apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and gene expression. He explores innovative therapeutic strategies, including the use of gemcitabine, gene therapy, and lentiviral vectors to target cancer mechanisms. His studies employ functional genomics, exome sequencing, and RNA interference to delve into the complexities of genetic alterations, including microsatellite instability and chromatin dynamics in cancer cells. Turunen's work also highlights the interplay between tumor immunology, angiogenesis, and the regulatory roles of T lymphocytes and microRNAs, integrating these elements into a broader understanding of cancer progression and treatment resistance. Overall, his research contributes to advancing cancer treatment approaches by elucidating the molecular underpinnings of neoplasms and their microenvironment.
