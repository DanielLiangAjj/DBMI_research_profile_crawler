Research Overview:
Xuhai Xu's research focuses on the pivotal role of Human-AI collaboration in the realm of medical decision making, particularly in the diagnosis of sepsis. By integrating advanced technologies such as impedance cardiography, electrocardiography, and photoplethysmography, Xu explores how these tools can enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve patient outcomes. The utilization of physiological metrics, including blood pressure and heart rate, underscores the importance of real-time data in critical care settings. Overall, Xu's work aims to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence capabilities and human clinical expertise, ultimately advancing the effectiveness of medical interventions in life-threatening conditions like sepsis.
