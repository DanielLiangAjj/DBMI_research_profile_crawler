Researcher: Christoph Kellendonk
Research Overview:
Christoph Kellendonk's research primarily focuses on the intricate roles of dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain's neural pathways and their implications for behavior and cognitive processes. His work extensively examines D2 receptors within the striatopallidal and basal ganglia circuits, particularly their influence on motor control, cognitive flexibility, and the neural mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Using animal models, particularly mice, Kellendonk explores the neurophysiological dynamics of medium spiny neurons and cholinergic interneurons, with an emphasis on the direct and indirect pathways involved in operant conditioning and motivational behaviors. His research leverages advanced techniques including optogenetics and DREADD systems for precise manipulation of neuronal activity, contributing to a deeper understanding of thalamocortical connectivity and its role in cognitive functioning and disease states. Overall, his studies provide critical insights into the neurobiological foundations of motivation, learning, and psychiatric conditions, paving the way for potential therapeutic strategies in neuropsychiatry.
