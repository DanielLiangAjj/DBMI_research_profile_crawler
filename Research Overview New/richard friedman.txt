Research Overview:
Richard Friedmanâ€™s research primarily focuses on various aspects of shoulder arthroplasty, analyzing its complications, outcomes, and related surgical techniques. His investigations cover a range of topics including rotator cuff repair, glenoid component fixation, and the implications of demographic factors such as age and body mass index (BMI) on surgical outcomes. Friedman utilizes advanced modeling techniques, including finite element analysis, to assess joint biomechanics, and has also explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical practices and patient satisfaction. His work extends to evaluating postoperative complications, mental health implications, and disparities in healthcare access, particularly within the context of total shoulder arthroplasties. By integrating clinical epidemiology with practical surgical insights, Friedman contributes significantly to enhancing surgical outcomes and patient care in orthopedic practices.
