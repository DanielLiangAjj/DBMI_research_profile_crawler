Researcher: Tuuli Lappalainen
Research Overview:
Tuuli Lappalainen's research focuses on the multifaceted role of genetic variation and gene regulation, particularly through DNA methylation and its impact on gene expression across diverse contexts and conditions. The integration of techniques like noninvasive RNA sequencing and statistical models allows for in-depth analysis of gene-environment interactions, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and alternative splicing processes. Lappalainen's work extends to the exploration of genetic predisposition to diseases, including the response to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the relevance of functional genomics in understanding complex traits and the underlying biological mechanisms. By leveraging data from large cohorts such as the GTEx and Simons Simplex Collection, Lappalainen aims to elucidate the contributions of trans-acting genetic variation and transcription factor activity, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of heritable phenotypic variations and potential therapeutic targets in conditions such as COVID-19 and genetic disorders.
