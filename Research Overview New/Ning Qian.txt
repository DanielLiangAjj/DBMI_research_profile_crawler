Researcher: Ning Qian
Research Overview:
Ning Qian's research encompasses a diverse array of topics at the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, and plant pathology. In the realm of neuroscience, Qian's work focuses on visuomotor interactions, particularly exploring phenomena such as compressive remapping, perceptual mislocalization, and spatial perception through the lens of saccadic eye movements and the roles of specific brain regions like the parietal and frontal lobes. Studies related to perceptual biases and working memory underscore the importance of coordinated connections in ensuring visual stability during transsaccadic movements. Additionally, the researcher delves into the molecular phylogeny and pathogenicity of fungal species, emphasizing their ecological impact and relevance to crop types such as oilseeds and legumes. The exploration of chronic fatigue syndrome and oxidative stress in pregnant models shows Qian's commitment to understanding physiological adaptations and their psychological implications. Overall, Qian's research provides significant insights into the complexities of visual perception, cognitive processing, and the interplay between organisms and their environments, enriching our understanding of both human neuroscience and plant biology.
