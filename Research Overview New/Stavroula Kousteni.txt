Researcher: Stavroula Kousteni
Research Overview:
Stavroula Kousteni's research primarily investigates the complex interplay between bone biology, energy metabolism, and neuroendocrine regulation, particularly as it pertains to conditions such as obesity and osteoporosis. Her studies explore the role of Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) and its effects on appetite regulation and Î²-cell function, thereby linking metabolic processes to bone health. Utilizing mouse models and human cohorts, her work delves into crucial mechanisms such as hematopoiesis within stem cell niches and the influence of various hormones and signaling pathways on osteoblast function and differentiation. This research is pivotal in understanding the molecular underpinnings of increased bone mass conditions and the implications of adipokines in obesity. Overall, Kousteni's investigations contribute significantly to the fields of neuroscience, endocrinology, and bone biology, shedding light on how metabolic diseases impact skeletal health and offering insights into potential therapeutic approaches for related disorders.
