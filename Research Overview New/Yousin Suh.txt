Researcher: Yousin Suh
Research Overview:
Yousin Suh's research focuses on the complex interplay between genetics, aging, and age-related diseases, particularly through the lens of various biological models such as *Caenorhabditis elegans* and human studies. The researcher investigates molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to diseases like Alzheimer's, glaucoma, and sarcopenia, utilizing advanced genetic tools like CRISPR, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and systems biology. Key themes in the work include the regulation of gene expression by non-coding RNAs (such as circRNAs and miRNAs), the role of specific genetic variants in longevity, cellular senescence, and inflammation, as well as the impact of dietary restriction and mitochondrial function. Suh explores biomarkers of aging and the genetic predispositions of centenarians, shedding light on the pathways that govern longevity, cellular repair, and metabolism. This comprehensive approach helps to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of healthspan, potentially guiding therapeutic strategies for age-associated conditions.
