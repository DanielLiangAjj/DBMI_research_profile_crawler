Researcher: Marian B. Carlson
Research Overview:
Marian B. Carlson's research primarily focuses on the regulatory mechanisms surrounding AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its impact on glucose metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through extensive studies involving yeast genetics, the research examines the phosphorylation of various proteins, the function of protein phosphatases, and the roles played by protein serine-threonine kinases in cellular processes. Utilizing techniques such as gene deletion, immunoblotting, and mutagenesis, Carlson investigates the catalytic domains of these proteins and their interactions within multienzyme complexes. The insights gained from these studies enhance the understanding of energy metabolism dynamics, particularly how glucose and glycogen metabolism are regulated under diverse environmental conditions, such as oxidative stress and temperature variations. Overall, Carlsonâ€™s contributions significantly advance the field of metabolic regulation and have implications for broader biological models.
