Researcher: YiMing Luo
Research Overview:
Dr. YiMing Luo's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on cancer immunotherapy and its interplay with epigenetic mechanisms. His work highlights the roles of lysine demethylases (KDMs) and lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) in tumor biology, emphasizing their potential as therapeutic targets in cancers such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Luo also explores the efficacy of combined treatments, particularly involving agents like Venetoclax, against immune evasion strategies employed by tumors, including the involvement of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages. Furthermore, his investigations into the metastatic processes and regulatory elements, such as long noncoding RNAs and the TGF-Î² pathway, contribute to an understanding of tumor progression and prognosis. Beyond oncology, his research extends to the environmental impacts of agricultural practices, particularly through the study of biochar and wastewater management in pig farming, linking these findings to broader issues of soil health and climate change. Dr. Luo's multifaceted inquiry into cancer biology, combined treatment strategies, and environmental sustainability marks a significant contribution to scientific knowledge and its applications in both clinical and ecological contexts.
