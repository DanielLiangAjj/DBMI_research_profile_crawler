Researcher: Kapil V. Ramachandran
Research Overview:
Kapil V. Ramachandran's research significantly contributes to the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying developmental processes and disease states, particularly focusing on neuronal activity and cardiac conditions. His work involves the regulation of immediate early genes and proteins associated with the membrane proteasome, exploring the roles of calcium signaling in hypertrophy and congenital heart defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Utilizing a variety of biological models, including genetically modified mice and zebrafish, Ramachandran investigates the intricacies of proteolysis, ribosome activity, and neurogenesis. His findings are essential for elucidating the roles of specific transcription factors and signaling pathways in cell differentiation and disease mechanisms, bridging key concepts between neural and cardiac biology. Through these investigations, his research seeks to enhance our understanding of the fundamental processes that govern heart development and the neural regulation of these pathways, contributing valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for congenital heart defects and other related conditions.
