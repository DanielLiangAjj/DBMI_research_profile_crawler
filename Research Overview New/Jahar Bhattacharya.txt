Researcher: Jahar Bhattacharya
Research Overview:
Jahar Bhattacharya's research primarily focuses on the mechanisms and pathways involved in acute lung injury (ALI) and its associated complexities, such as pulmonary edema and the blood-air barrier's integrity. His studies explore the roles of various biological entities, including mitochondria, calcium signaling, connexin-43, and the endothelium, particularly in relation to conditions like ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and infections, including influenza A and bacterial pneumonia. Through advanced methodologies like live and fluorescence microscopy, Bhattacharya investigates how alterations in cellular communication, mechanotransduction, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±), contribute to lung damage and repair processes. Additionally, his work addresses potential therapeutic strategies involving ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and statins, particularly in the context of COVID-19 and future pandemics. The overarching aim of his research is to elucidate cellular immune responses and therapeutic interventions to enhance lung repair and regeneration, ultimately improving outcomes for patients suffering from lung injuries and related respiratory conditions.
