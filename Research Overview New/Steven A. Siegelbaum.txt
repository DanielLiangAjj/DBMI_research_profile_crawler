Researcher: Steven A. Siegelbaum
Research Overview:
Steven A. Siegelbaum's research predominantly revolves around the hippocampus, particularly focusing on the CA2 region and its role in various cognitive functions, including memory, learning, and social behavior. His studies explore the intricate dynamics of neuronal plasticity, synaptic integration, and the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons and interneurons within the hippocampus. Utilizing advanced techniques such as calcium imaging and optogenetics, Siegelbaum investigates mechanisms underlying social memory, sensory coding, and associative learning, particularly in relation to contextual fear conditioning and social discrimination. His work highlights the significance of specific neurotransmitters (e.g., cholecystokinin, glutamate, and opioids) and their receptors in modulating synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability in both healthy and epileptic contexts. By employing animal models and diverse methodologies, Siegelbaum's contributions significantly enhance our understanding of the neurobiological basis of cognitive functions, paving the way for potential therapeutic strategies in neurological disorders.
