Researcher: Clarissa Waites
Research Overview:
Clarissa Waites' research has a strong focus on neurobiology, particularly how glucocorticoids influence tau protein dynamics and synaptic function in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Her studies explore the mechanisms of tau propagation, the role of stress in these processes, and the unconventional pathways of protein secretion that may impact axonal transport and synaptic transmission. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as live-cell imaging, microfluidic analytical techniques, and high-content screening, Waites investigates the interaction between synaptic vesicles, endosomal sorting complexes, and various receptors—like AMPA and NMDA—within hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, her work integrates molecular and cellular models, shedding light on the cellular transport mechanisms and synaptic plasticity that could contribute to cognitive dysfunction associated with stress and neurodegeneration. Overall, Waites' research is pivotal in unraveling the complex interplay between stress responses and neurodegenerative processes at the cellular level, with potential implications for developing therapeutic strategies targeting synaptic health and cognitive resilience.
