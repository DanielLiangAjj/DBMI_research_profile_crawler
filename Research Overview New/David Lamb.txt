Researcher: David Lamb
Research Overview:
David Lambâ€™s research focuses on the intricate systems of cytochrome P450 enzymes and their evolutionary adaptations in various biological contexts, including infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and cancer mechanisms, particularly prostate cancer. His studies emphasize structural biology through methodologies like X-ray crystallography to elucidate the active sites, substrate specificity, and amino acid dynamics of these enzymes. Lamb explores pharmacological aspects, such as enzyme inhibitors and antifungal drug design, while also investigating their roles in metabolic processes within bacteria and fungi. Moreover, he looks into the implications of cytochrome P450 in agricultural biotechnology and artificial intelligence applications for disease detection. Additionally, his research intersects with health care ethics, bioethics, and public health concerns, shedding light on decision-making processes in complex health-related scenarios, particularly in end-of-life care. Overall, his contributions span a range of disciplines, marrying microbiology, enzymology, health care, and ethical inquiry into a cohesive body of work.
