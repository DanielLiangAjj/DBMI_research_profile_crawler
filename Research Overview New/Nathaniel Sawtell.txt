Researcher: Nathaniel Sawtell
Research Overview:
Nathaniel Sawtell's research explores the interplay between sensory processing, motor control, and learning through the lens of neuroethology and computational neuroscience, primarily using electric fish and mouse models. His investigations focus on mechanisms such as corollary discharge, synaptic plasticity, and temporal coding, particularly as they relate to the cerebellum's functions in proprioception and motor decision-making. By analyzing the role of dendritic spikes and dynamic neural networks, Sawtell aims to understand how organisms adapt to their environment, influencing behaviors such as locomotion and prey detection. His work provides insights into how the nervous system integrates sensory feedback and anticipates movements, contributing to a broader understanding of neural processes underlying behavior and cognition across different species.
