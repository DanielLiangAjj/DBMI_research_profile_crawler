Researcher: Sara Zaccara
Research Overview:
Sara Zaccara's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of RNA regulation, particularly in the context of epitranscriptomics and the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation in mRNA stability and translation. By investigating key RNA-binding proteins such as YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, and DHX30, her work addresses the impact of these proteins on processes like transcription, translation, and apoptosis, with a specific emphasis on the tumor suppressor protein p53. Utilizing techniques such as polysomal profiling and CLIP, Zaccara explores how modifications to RNA, including methylation and alterations in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), influence gene expression regulation in various cellular contexts, including cancerous environments. Her findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the translatome and the functional implications of RNA modifications in cellular differentiation, stress response, and tumor biology, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of the molecular underpinnings of neoplasms and potential therapeutic targets.
