Researcher: Peter D. Kwong
Research Overview:
Peter D. Kwong's research focuses on the design and development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and vaccines for various viral infections, particularly HIV-1, influenza viruses, and SARS-CoV-2. His work extensively employs advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography to elucidate the molecular structures of viral proteins and their interactions with antibodies. Key topics in his research include immunogen design, vaccine development strategies, and the pharmacokinetics of antibodies, emphasizing enhancements in half-life and neutralizing responses. His studies on bispecific antibodies and nanobodies highlight innovative approaches to achieve robust immune responses against viral epitopes, aiming to improve vaccination outcomes. Through these endeavors, Kwong contributes vital insights into antibody evolution, immunogenicity, and the mechanisms of immune evasion, thereby paving the way for next-generation vaccine candidates and improved therapeutic strategies against viral diseases.
