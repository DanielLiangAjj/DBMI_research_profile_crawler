Researcher: Richard Mann
Research Overview:
Richard Mann's research encompasses a broad range of topics primarily centered around animal behavior, genetics, and molecular biology, with a particular focus on Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. His work investigates animal movements, collective behavior, and decision-making processes, applying computational models, including agent-based modeling and Bayesian statistics, to better understand these phenomena across species. In addition, Mann explores genetic regulation and engineering techniques, utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 and other genome editing methods to probe gene expression and transcription regulation. His research delves into the intricacies of motor neuron functionality and neurodegeneration, specifically studying conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the impacts of thiamine deficiency. In a broader context, he examines evolutionary biology through the lens of molecular clocks and phylogenetics, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms of biological evolution and species diversification. Overall, his interdisciplinary approach integrates ethology, genomics, and developmental biology, significantly contributing to our understanding of both fundamental and applied biological sciences.
