Researcher: Alexander Sobolevsky
Research Overview:
Alexander Sobolevsky's research spans the molecular and structural biology of ion channels, particularly focusing on transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). The utilization of advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography, and patch-clamp methodologies allows for detailed insights into the gating mechanisms, ligand-binding properties, and conformational dynamics of these channels. His work aims to elucidate the roles of various modulators, including drugs and natural compounds, in regulating channel activity, which holds significant implications for understanding calcium signaling in cancer and neuronal excitability. Furthermore, his exploration into the structural aspects of ion channels contributes to the broader understanding of ion transport, neurotransmission, and the potential development of therapeutics targeting these important cellular components. Through comparative studies with model organisms and biochemical assays, Sobolevsky's research significantly advances the field of ion channel pharmacology and structural biology, providing critical knowledge that could lead to innovative treatments for neurodegeneration and other diseases linked to ion channel dysfunction.
