Researcher: Megan Sykes
Research Overview:
Megan Sykes's research focuses primarily on understanding immune tolerance mechanisms in the context of transplantation, particularly intestinal and hematopoietic stem cell transplants. Her work employs advanced techniques such as single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing to investigate B cell and T cell subpopulations, which play critical roles in graft-vs-host disease and graft tolerance. Sykes explores the dynamics of B cell repertoire and T cell immunity in longitudinal human studies and animal models, including non-human primate studies, to assess the development of resident memory B cells and the impact of mixed chimerism on immune tolerance. Additionally, Sykes's research addresses autoimmune conditions like Type 1 diabetes, emphasizing the need for personalized approaches in transplant immunobiology. Through her work, she aims to inform clinical protocols that enhance graft survival and minimize rejection while fostering greater insights into the immune system's adaptability following transplant procedures.
