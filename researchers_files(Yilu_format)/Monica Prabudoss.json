        "Abstract": "To date, radical surgery remains the best curative option in patients with early-stage lung cancer. In patients with small lung lesions, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) should be increasingly chosen as a fundamental alternative to thoracotomy as it is associated with less postoperative pain and better quality of life. This scenario necessarily increases the need for thoracic surgeons to implement new localization techniques. The conventional near-infrared (NIR) indocyanine green (ICG) method demonstrated a significant limitation in deep cancer recognition, principally due to its intrinsic low-depth tissue penetration. Similarly, the lymph-node sentinel approach conducted by the ICG method was demonstrated to be inefficient, mainly due to the non-specificity of the tracker and the irregular pathway of pulmonary lymph node drainage. Our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Cetuximab- IRDye800CW in marking lung nodules and mediastinal lymph nodes.",

        "Abstract": "Free-electron-lasers fill a critical gap in the space of THz-sources as they can reach high average and peak powers with spectral tunability. Using a waveguide in a THz FEL significantly increases the coupling between the relativistic electrons and electromagnetic field enabling large amounts of radiation to be generated in a single passage of electrons through the undulator. In addition to transversely confining the radiation, the dispersive properties of the waveguide critically affect the velocity and slippage of the radiation pulse which determine the central frequency and bandwidth of the generated radiation. In this paper, we characterize the spectral properties of a compact waveguide THz FEL including simultaneous lasing at two different frequencies and demonstrating tuning of the radiation wavelength in the high frequency branch by varying the beam energy and ensuring that the electrons injected into the undulator are prebunched on the scale of the resonant radiation wavelength.",

In the present study, a method able to detect G. duodenalis mixed-assemblage infections using next generation amplicon sequencing (NGS) of the beta-giardin gene was applied in combination with the US-FDA's BAM Chapter 19b protocol for detection of G. duodenalis from fresh produce to ascertain the limit of detection of G. duodenalis on leafy greens. Ready-to-eat baby Romaine lettuce was inoculated with 5 (n=5), 20 (n=10), 100 (n=10), 200 (n=10), or 1000 (n=10) G. duodenalis cysts of the assemblage B strain H3. Detection of G. duodenalis was successful in 100% of the samples seeded with 1000, 200, and 100 cysts, in 50% of the samples seeded with 20 cysts, and in none of the samples seeded with 5 cysts. We thus demonstrate robust detection of G. duodenalis on packaged leafy greens using the BAM Chapter 19B method coupled with assemblage-sensitive NGS. This protocol provides a new diagnostic tool useful for both prevalence studies and outbreak investigations involving fresh produce that may assist in better describing the role of G. duodenalis in foodborne illness and in protecting consumers from contaminated fresh produce.",

Emulsions with varying CHF concentrations (2\u00a0%, 3\u00a0%, and 4\u00a0%) were prepared and compared to a control. The results from the creaming index and particle size (emulsion) analyses indicated that the highest emulsion stability was achieved with 4\u00a0%CHF, attributed to its protein content (20.5\u00a0%). The encapsulates exhibited spherical and rough surface morphologies but without holes on the surface. Low moisture content (MC\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0%) and water activity (a",

        "Title": "Identifying vulnerabilities in essential health services: Analysing the effects of system shocks on childhood vaccination delivery in Lebanon.",
        "Abstract": "Shocks effects are under-theorised in the growing literature on health system resilience. Existing work has focused on the effects of single shocks on discrete elements within the health system, typically at national level. Using qualitative system dynamics, we explored how effects of multiple shocks interacted across system levels and combined with existing vulnerabilities to produce effects on essential health services delivery, through the prism of a case study on childhood vaccination in Lebanon. Lebanon has experienced a series of shocks in recent years, including large-scale refugee arrivals from neighbouring Syria, the COVID-19 pandemic and a political-economic crisis. We developed a causal loop diagram (CLD) to explore the effects of each shock individually, and in combination. The CLD was developed and validated using qualitative data from interviews with 38 stakeholders working in Lebanon's vaccination delivery system, in roles ranging from national level policy to facility-level service delivery, conducted between February 2020 and January 2022. We found that each of the shocks had different effects on service demand- and supply-side dynamics. These effects cascaded from national through to local levels. Both Syrian refugee movement and the COVID-19 pandemic primarily exposed vulnerabilities in service demand, mainly through slowly emerging knock-on effects on vaccination uptake behaviour among host communities, and fear of contracting infection in crowded health facilities respectively. The economic crisis exposed wider system vulnerabilities, including demand for vaccination as household income collapsed, and supply-side effects such as reduced clinic time for vaccination, declining workforce retention, and reduced availability of viable vaccine doses, among others. Finally, important pathways of interaction between shocks were identified, particularly affecting the balance between demand for vaccination through publicly supported facilities and private clinics. Future research should incorporate dynamic approaches to identifying within-system vulnerabilities and their potential impacts under different scenarios, as a precursor to improved resilience measurement, system preparedness, and intervention targeting.",

        "Abstract": "The hemostatic system is characterized by a delicate balance between pro- and anticoagulant forces, and the smallest alteration can cause serious events such as hemorrhages or thrombosis. Although exercise has been shown to play a protective role in athletes, several factors may increase the risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), including hemoconcentration induced by exertion, immobilization following sports injuries, frequent long-distance flights, dehydration, and the use of oral contraceptives in female athletes. Biomarkers such as D-dimer, Factor VIII, thrombin generation, inflammatory cytokines, and leukocyte count are involved in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), although their interpretation is complex and may indicate the presence of other conditions such as infections, inflammation, and heart disease. Therefore, the identification of biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity is needed for the screening and early diagnosis of thromboembolism. Recent evidence about the correlation between the intensity of physical activity and VTE is divergent, whereas the repeated gestures in sports such as baseball, hockey, volleyball, swimming, wrestling, or, on the other hand, soccer players, runners, and martial art training represent a risk factor predisposing to the onset of upper and lower DVT. Anticoagulant therapy is the gold standard, reducing the risk of serious complications such as pulmonary embolism. The aim of this review is to provide a general overview about the interplay between physical exercise and the risk of thromboembolism in athletes, focusing on the main causes of thrombosis in professional athletes and underlying the need to identify new markers and therapies that can represent a valid tool for safeguarding the athlete's health.",

        "Abstract": "Milk consumption is crucial for a balanced diet, yet recent trends indicate a decline, especially in Italy. A significant factor in this decline is the altered perception of milk quality among consumers, which has created a communication gap between them and other stakeholders. This study aimed to explore the discourse on social media and sentiment towards the concept of milk quality among consumers, farmers, and processors. The research adopted social media analysis to examine online-community messages. A sample of 19,906 Italian comments and posts mentioning keywords \"milk\", \"quality\", \"cow\", and \"vaccine\" was collected and categorized using term-frequency analysis, correspondence analysis, and sentiment analysis. Results highlighted gaps in perceptions of milk quality: farmers focused on economic issues, consumers on animal welfare and health, and processors on lactose content. For farmers, almost all comments were negative, while for processors, nearly all comments were positive. Consumers presented a more mixed picture. This work contributes to the literature by expanding research on milk quality, using social media as a source of information. The findings suggest that enhancing communication and understanding among these groups could lead to more effective strategies for addressing consumer concerns, potentially reversing the decline in milk consumption.",

        "Title": "Sustained Cognitive Improvement in Alzheimer's Disease Patients Following a Precision Medicine Protocol: Case Series.",
        "Abstract": "Arguably, the most important parameter in treating cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease is the length of time in which improvement, if achieved at all, is sustained. However, monotherapies such as donepezil and memantine are associated with a more rapid decline than no treatment in patients over multi-year follow-ups. Furthermore, anti-amyloid antibody treatment, which at best simply slows decline, is associated with accelerated cerebral atrophy, resulting in earlier dementia-associated brain volumes for those treated at the MCI stage than untreated patients. In contrast, a precision medicine approach, in which the multiple potential drivers of cognitive decline are identified for each patient and then targeted with a personalized protocol (such as ReCODE), has led to documented improvements in patients with cognitive decline, but long-term follow-up (>5 years) has not been reported previously. Therefore, here, we report sustained cognitive improvement, in some cases for over a decade, in patients treated with a precision medicine protocol-something that has not been reported in patients treated with anti-cholinesterase, glutamate receptor inhibitory, anti-amyloid, or other therapeutic methods. These case studies warrant long-term cohort studies to determine how frequently such sustained cognitive improvements occur in patients treated with precision medicine protocols.",

        "Abstract": "Climate change mitigation and adaptation along with air pollution are key challenges that require a comprehensive planning approach able to promote win-win strategies and avoid transferring environmental pressures from one sector to another. The joint approach is widely advocated at the policy level while the scientific research investigates the role of co-benefits in planning processes. A methodological framework was developed with the twofold aim of (i) assessing the current integration degree between regional Air Quality Plans and Climate Plans and (ii) providing useful hints for pursuing greater air-climate integration. Its application to the Italian case study provides useful policy implications for strengthening the role of co-benefits as drivers of planning processes. Results show that a greater air-climate integration can be achieved by enhancing the role of regional authorities in supporting the implementation of local-scale plans and actions. This is especially important in contexts where an integrated planning framework is lacking and the mainstreaming within sectoral sub-regional plans turns out to be crucial.",

        "Abstract": "Longitudinal monitoring of vital signs provides a method for identifying changes to general health in an individual, particularly in older adults. The nocturnal sleep period provides a convenient opportunity to assess vital signs. Contactless technologies that can be embedded into the bedroom environment are unintrusive and burdenless and have the potential to enable seamless monitoring of vital signs. To realize this potential, these technologies need to be evaluated against gold standard measures and in relevant populations.",

        "Abstract": "The immunocrit is a cost-effective and straightforward technique traditionally used to assess passive immunity transfer to newborn piglets. However, it has not been previously used for monitoring the effect of vaccination and/or infections. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the immunocrit technique as an immunological monitoring tool in a vaccination and challenge scenario, using porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) as pathogen model. The immunocrit ratio was monitored in PCV-2 vaccinated (V) and non-vaccinated (NV) 3-week-old piglets (study day 0, SD0) that were subsequently challenged with this virus at SD21 and followed up to SD42. Additional techniques (PCV-2 IgG ELISA, optical refractometry, and proteinogram) were performed to further characterize the results of the immunocrit analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Melanoma-associated antigen-A (MAGE-A) is expressed in multiple cancers with restricted expression in normal tissue. We sought to assess the MAGE-A3/A6 expression profile as well as immune landscape in urothelial (UC) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We also assessed co-expression of immune-associated markers, including programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumor and/or immune cells, and assessed the effect of checkpoint inhibitor treatment on these markers in the context of urothelial carcinoma. We used formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from a variety of tumor types were screened by IHC for MAGE-A and PD-L1 expression. Gene expression analyses by RNA sequencing were performed on RNA extracted from serial tissue sections. UC tumor samples from patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors were assessed by IHC and NanoString gene expression analysis for MAGE-A and immune marker expression before and after treatment. Overall, 84 samples (57%) had any detectable MAGE-A expression. Detectable MAGE-A expression was present at similar frequencies in both tumor tissue types, with 41 (50%) NSCLC and 43 (64%) UC. MAGE-A expression was not significantly changed before and after checkpoint inhibitor therapy by both IHC and NanoString mRNA sequencing. Other immune markers were similarly unchanged post immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Stable expression of MAGE-A3/A6 pre and post checkpoint inhibitor treatment indicates that archival specimens harvested after checkpoint therapy are applicable to screening potential candidates for MAGE therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Acetabular retroversion is associated with impingement and instability. An adequate interpretation of acetabular version and coverage on radiographs is essential to determine the optimal treatment strategy (periacetabular osteotomy vs hip arthroscopic surgery). The crossover sign (COS) has been associated with the presence of acetabular retroversion, and the anterior wall index (AWI) and posterior wall index (PWI) assess anteroposterior acetabular coverage. However, the radiographic appearance of the acetabulum is sensitive to anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) morphology and pelvic tilt (PT), which differs between the supine and standing positions.",

While most attention is paid to childhood infection, the RSV burden in adults\u2009\u226560\u2009y should also be considered. In Brazil, this is generally underrecognized, where greater focus is toward other respiratory pathogens. This article presents insights from a multidisciplinary panel gathered to review epidemiologic data and current diagnostic approaches to RSV in Brazil (and their limitations) and develop communication strategies to improve knowledge and awareness. National surveillance data indicate a steady increase in cases of RSV-related severe acute respiratory illness (RSV-SARI) in those aged\u2009\u226560\u2009y in recent years, with high fatality rates (>30%). Routine RSV testing in older individuals with respiratory symptoms is relatively low. Educational activities targeted toward health-care professionals and the general public are critical to raising awareness of the importance of RSV in older individuals, particularly as protective vaccines are now available.",

        "Abstract": "Research examining the relationship between a neighborhood's built-environment and resident health or health-related outcomes has largely either focused on static characteristics using a cross-sectional research design or focuses on the neighborhood in its entirety. Such an approach makes it difficult to understand how specific dynamic neighborhood characteristics are associated with individual well-being. In this analysis, we use longitudinal data from the Pittsburgh Research on Neighborhood Change and Health (PHRESH) studies to assess the relationship between publicly funded neighborhood investments occurring across seven years (2011-2018) on five health-related outcomes: food insecurity, stress, perceived neighborhood safety, neighborhood satisfaction, and dietary quality. We additionally utilize this dataset to determine whether the distance between an individual's place of residence and the investment, as measured at the neighborhood, 1 mile, and \u00bd mile level, effects the magnitude of associations. Using individual and year fixed effects models, we find that when measured at the neighborhood level, a one standard deviation increase in investments (about $130 million dollars) is associated with decreased food insecurity (-0.294 sd), increased safety (0.231 sd), and increased neighborhood satisfaction (0.201 sd) among adults who remain in the study for at least two waves of data collection. We also analyze specific investment types and find that commercial investments are largely driving the changes in food insecurity, safety, and neighborhood satisfaction, while business investments are correlated with the decrease in stress. We find no relationship between investments and dietary quality.",

        "Title": "Detection Limits of Insect Fragments in Spiked Whole Wheat Flour Using Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).",
        "Abstract": "The need for a sensitive molecular method to detect specific species of insect contaminants in food products remains a significant challenge in the food industry. This study evaluated the detection limit of a multiplex end-point PCR assay for detecting insects in food. The assay amplifies two fragments of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI-Fa and COI-Fb) and one fragment of the protein-coding wingless (wg) gene found in insects. Five insect species, comprising three vectors of foodborne pathogens (the housefly, Musca domestica, the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, and the pharaoh ant, Monomorium pharaonis) and two storage insect pests (the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum and the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella), were spiked separately and in combination at levels of 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001% in whole wheat flour. At spike levels greater than 0.01%, amplicon bands of expected sizes were seen in 100% of samples containing fragments from distinct insect species. At least 25% of spiked samples at the lowest spike level had amplicon bands, except for samples spiked with M. domestica. Results showed an 18.9% probability (with 11.3% and 30% lower and upper confidence limits, respectively) of detecting insect fragments at the lowest spike level (0.001%, corresponding to 3-22 fragments), which is far below the FDA's regulatory level of less than 75 fragments per 50\u00a0g of wheat flour. The intensity of amplicon bands in the gel images was higher at higher spike levels. However, this method is not quantitative enough to extrapolate the intensity of the amplicon bands to the number of insect fragments present in a sample. This multiplex assay was also evaluated in a variety of market food samples derived from plants and animals, showing its potential use in various food types. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of this molecular approach suggest that it could be used in the future as a screening tool for detecting insect contaminants in food.",

        "Title": "Mfn2 induces NCLX-mediated calcium release from mitochondria.",
        "Abstract": "Mfn2 is a mitochondrial outer membrane fusion protein with the additional role of tethering mitochondria to the ER. Here, we describe a novel connection between Mfn2 and calcium release from mitochondria. We show that Mfn2 controls the mitochondrial inner membrane sodium-calcium exchange protein NCLX, which is a major source for calcium release from mitochondria. This discovery was made with the fungal toxin Phomoxanthone (PXA), which induces calcium release from mitochondria. PXA-induced calcium release is blocked by a chemical inhibitor of NCLX, while NCLX and Mfn2 deletions both also prevent PXA-induced calcium release. CETSA experiments show that PXA directly targets Mfn2, which likely controls NCLX through physical interactions since co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays show increased association between Mfn2 and NCLX upon treatment with PXA. Interactions between Mfn2 and NCLX also increase when cells are treated with mitochondrial ROS-inducing conditions, such as oligomycin treatment of respiring cells, while the interactions do not increase in Oma1 -/- cells. It seems likely that opening of cristae by Oma1-mediated cleavage of Opa1 promotes translocation of NCLX from cristae to the rim where it can come into contact with Mfn2 thus promoting PXA-induced calcium release from mitochondria. These results therefore delineate a pathway that connects ROS produced inside mitochondria with calcium release and signaling in the cytosol.",

Forensic medical examination of victims of CRSV can be performed for the clinical and forensic management of patients or as part of the medical affidavit in judicial protection procedures. The aim of this scoping review was to summarize the knowledge on the forensic medical examination of survivors of CRSV by analyzing what types of violence were described by survivors, as well as the outcome of medical examination and evaluation of the degree of consistency, and of protection procedures. After the screening process, 17 articles published between January 1st, 2013, and April 3rd, 2023, on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were eligible for inclusion. The findings of our review confirm that literature addressing forensic medical examination of victims of CRSV is scarce, as well as studies describing physicians' opinion on the consistency of the findings and protection outcomes. Trained and experienced professionals are needed in order to document human rights violations, including CRSV-specific lesions.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative condition marked by gradual cognitive deterioration and the loss of neurons. While conventional bulk RNA sequencing techniques have shed light on AD pathology, they frequently obscure the cellular diversity within brain tissues. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed our capability to analyze the cellular composition of AD, allowing for the detection of unique cell populations, rare cell types, and gene expression alterations at an individual cell level. This review examines the use of scRNA-seq in AD research, focusing on its contributions to understanding cellular diversity, disease progression, and potential therapeutic targets. We discuss key technological innovations, data analysis techniques, and challenges associated with scRNA-seq in studying AD. Furthermore, we highlight recent studies that have utilized scRNA-seq to identify novel biomarkers, uncover disease-associated pathways, and elucidate the role of non-neuronal cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, in AD pathogenesis. By providing a comprehensive overview of advancements in scRNA-seq for unraveling cellular heterogeneity in AD, this review highlights the transformative impact of scRNA-seq on our comprehension of disease mechanisms and the creation of targeted treatments.",

This study analyzed park use and engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in specific park amenities across 198 parks in 27 US cities from the 2016 National Study of Neighborhood Parks based on each feature's square footage. The study also specifically measured use of park space by age group and gender. After mapping the parks, measuring the square feet of the most common amenities and controlling for factors like population density, neighborhood poverty levels, and park size, we found varied and inequitable use of amenities by age and gender, with men and boys having considerably greater use than women and girls. The findings suggest that park management and design should support more efficient, equitable, and beneficial use of public spaces.",

Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the antibacterial activity of three types of LASERs namely CO2 LASER.Er, Cr:YSGG LASER and Diode LASER in disinfection of root canals. 70 patients (105 single rooted teeth) were included in the study. There was application of 2% Sodium Hypochlorite (NaOCl), 2780 nm Er,Cr:YSGG LASER, 900 nm Diode LASER and CO2 LASER. Microbial samples were collected from root canals both before and after the interventions through paper points. These parameters were evaluated in microbiology laboratory to obtain Log10 Colony Forming Units (CFUs). There was significant reduction in CFUs of microorganisms inside root canal in all three LASERs evaluated and NaOCl. The reduction in CFUs in LASERs was comparable to NaOCl. Then secondly we applied each LASER in combination with NaOCl. It was observed that reduction in CFU was greater when combination of LASER with NaOCl was applied as compared when applied alone. It can be inferred that LASER when applied with NaOCl can have significant role in disinfection of root canals.",

        "Abstract": "The impact of multiple reuse on the alterations in internal threads of four different implant analogous composed of different materials (stainless steel (SS), aluminum (Al), titanium (Ti), and zirconia (Zr) by utilizing two die materials at different time durations is of interest to dentists. The spacing between the threads was measured using the impressions created for the interior threads of implant analogs, or replicas by stereomicroscope set to x50 at 0th, 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th interval. It was observed that there was decrease in distance between threads 1-2 as the increasing reuse at increasing time intervals in all implants analogs. However the decrease in distance between threads was low in Titanium implants analogs followed by Zircona implant analogs and the decrease was maximum in aluminum implants analogs followed by SS implant analogs. When there was evaluation of distance between threads 3-4 then it was observed that there was reduced decrease in distance between threads 3-4 as compared to threads 1-2 n all implant analogs. Similarly the reduction in distance between threads 5-6 was lesser as compared to threads 1-2 and threads 3-4. There was decrease in distance between threads 1-2 as the increasing reuse at increasing time intervals in all implants analogs. However, the reduction in distance between threads was lowest in Titanium implants analogs followed by Zircona implant analogs.",

        "Abstract": "We have previously reported that nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with IL-2 and TGF-\u03b2 and targeted to T cells induced polyclonal T regulatory cells (Tregs) that protected mice from graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Here, we evaluated whether administration of these NPs during alloantigen immunization could prevent allograft rejection by converting immunogenic responses to tolerogenic ones. Using C57BL/6 mice and BALB/c mice as either donors or recipients of allogeneic splenocytes, we found that treatment with the tolerogenic NPs in both strains of mice resulted in a marked inhibition of mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) to donor cell alloantigen but not to third-party control mouse cells after transfer of the allogeneic cells.

        "Abstract": "As cutting-edge technologies applied for the study of body fluid molecular biomarkers are continuously evolving, clinical applications of these biomarkers improve. Diverse forms of circulating molecular biomarkers have been described, including cell-free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and cell-free microRNAs (cfmiRs), although unresolved issues remain in their applicability, specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. Translational studies demonstrating the clinical utility and importance of cfmiRs in multiple cancers have significantly increased. This review aims to summarize the last 5\u2009years of translational cancer research in the field of cfmiRs and their potential clinical applications to diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring disease recurrence or treatment responses with a focus on solid tumors. PubMed was utilized for the literature search, following rigorous exclusion criteria for studies based on tumor types, patient sample size, and clinical applications. A total of 136 studies on cfmiRs in different solid tumors were identified and divided based on tumor types, organ sites, number of cfmiRs found, methodology, and types of biofluids analyzed. This comprehensive review emphasizes clinical applications of cfmiRs and summarizes underserved areas where more research and validations are needed.",

        "Abstract": "Current treatment outcome of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) remains poor. Following standard therapy, recurrence is universal with limited survival. Tumors from 173 GBM patients are analysed for somatic mutations to generate a personalized peptide vaccine targeting tumor-specific neoantigens. All patients were treated within the scope of an individual healing attempt. Among all vaccinated patients, including 70 treated prior to progression (primary) and 103 treated after progression (recurrent), the median overall survival from first diagnosis is 31.9 months (95% CI: 25.0-36.5). Adverse events are infrequent and are predominantly grade 1 or 2. A vaccine-induced immune response to at least one of the vaccinated peptides is detected in blood samples of 87 of 97 (90%) monitored patients. Vaccine-specific T-cell responses are durable in most patients. Significantly prolonged survival is observed for patients with multiple vaccine-induced T-cell responses (53 months) compared to those with no/low induced responses (27 months; P\u2009=\u20090.03). Altogether, our results highlight that the application of personalized neoantigen-targeting peptide vaccine is feasible and represents a promising potential treatment option for GBM patients.",

Most hospitals use single-mode approaches, even though sequential mixed mode (MM) yields higher RRs and perhaps better patient representativeness. Some hospitals may be reluctant to incur MM's potential additional cost and complexity without knowing how much RRs would increase.",

        "Abstract": "Vicu\u00f1as (Vicugna vicugna) are wild South American camelids (SACs) protected by law in Argentina, and information on pathogens that infect them is scarce. In this study, an adult vicu\u00f1a found dead in the province of Salta was examined, and evidence of infection by Sarcocystis sp. protozoans was sought. Infection of skeletal muscles by S. aucheniae, with the production of macroscopic sarcocysts, a disease known as SAC sarcocystosis, has been described in the other three SACs - llamas, alpacas, and guanacos - but its occurrence in vicu\u00f1as has so far remained unknown. In the analyzed individual, many macroscopic cysts compatible with S. aucheniae were found upon necropsy in the muscular tissue of the neck and diaphragm. Analysis of 18\u00a0S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox-1) gene sequences by BLAST searches and construction of phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the etiological agent was S. aucheniae. Our results show for the first time that vicu\u00f1as act as intermediate hosts in the life cycle of this parasite. In addition, this study provides the first cox-1 sequences for S. aucheniae isolates from the four SAC species acting as intermediate hosts and suggests that this marker could be useful for genotypification of this parasite species. The impact of SAC sarcocystosis on the health, well-being, and fitness of vicu\u00f1as, and the relevance of vicu\u00f1a infections in the epidemiology of S. auchaniae, remain to be elucidated.",

        "Abstract": "Over the last several decades, Medicaid has been \"rebalancing\" services from institutions to the community, increasing support of home- and community-based services (HCBS). These services could potentially substitute for care typically provided by family members, replacing or reducing care from kin. Leveraging one of the most recent Medicaid rebalancing programs, the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), and using data from the 2008-2016 Health and Retirement Study on 953 Medicaid beneficiaries ages 65 and over with at least one functional limitation, we examined the relationship between exposure to BIP and family and professional caregiving. BIP exposure was not associated with receipt of care or total hours of care. It was, however, associated with more hours of professional care and fewer hours of family care from non-spouse kin. These findings suggest that recent Medicaid rebalancing programs, while intended to meet the desires of older adults, could have implications for their families.",

        "Title": "Chronic anterior shoulder instability with bone loss: a practical approach.",
        "Abstract": "The stability of the glenohumeral joint, known for its remarkable mobility, relies on several factors, including the congruency of the joint's bones and the integrity of capsulolabral structures, encompassing the labrum, the capsule, and the glenohumeral ligaments. In cases of anterior shoulder instability, bone lesions are a common occurrence, most frequently involving glenoid bone loss and Hill-Sachs lesions. When both glenoid and humeral bone lesions coexist, the isolated Bankart procedure has exhibited a significant rate of failure. In such instances, the Latarjet procedure, especially when bone loss is present, retains its position as the gold standard, thanks to its consistent success in both short- and long-term outcomes. Recent advancements in research have explored alternative strategies to address bone loss, including the Remplissage procedure for humeral bone deficits and the use of bone block grafts to manage glenoid bone lesions, with a focus on achieving more anatomical techniques. However, it's crucial to recognize that, beyond bone loss, a multitude of intrinsic and extrinsic factors come into play when determining the most suitable treatment. The patient's profile, including factors like constitutional laxity and activity level, must be carefully considered in the decision-making process. The Latarjet procedure maintains its esteemed status as a benchmark in the field, thanks to its consistent excellence in both short- and long-term results. This article seeks to provide insights into the roles and placement of various surgical techniques within the context of chronic anterior shoulder instability, taking into account the intricate interplay of factors that influence treatment decisions.",

        "Abstract": "To address the increasing rates of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury among young sports participants, the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and the Aspen Institute convened a meeting of a new national coalition to make ACL injury prevention a fundamental aspect of youth sports. This executive summary outlines the National ACL Injury Coalition's goals as defined at its inaugural meeting held at HSS on March 27, 2023. Using a theory of change called \"collective impact\" designed to support collaboration and drive systems-level change, the coalition focused on 4 strategic priorities intended to reduce ACL injury rates in high school sports participants: widespread implementation of interventions (ensuring that student athletes are adequately trained), high-quality education (raising awareness among many stakeholders), equitable access (ensuring that all high school sports participants, regardless of the resources available at their schools, have access to injury prevention resources), and aligning stakeholders (uniting disparate entities-schools, sports clubs, parents, coaches, and others in these efforts). The group outlined short-range, medium-range, and long-range goals over a 3-year period, including the launch of an ACL injury prevention toolkit for use by adolescent sports participants and teams, athletic trainers, coaches, and other key stakeholders.",

        "Abstract": "Recent decades have seen state successes in rebalancing Medicaid long-term care from institutional care (e.g., nursing homes) into home and community settings. However, significant barriers can prevent access to home and community-based services (HCBS) among older adults and persons with dementia. Qualitative research on potential innovations and solutions in the contemporary context with attention to a wider range of state-level policy contexts is limited. Drawing on interviews with 49 key informants including state Medicaid officials, HCBS providers, and advocates for persons with dementia across 11 states, we examined perceived solutions to barriers. Key informants articulated a range of potential solutions and innovations, ranging from tangible or realized policy changes to 'magic wand' solutions. Policy research has typically focused on the former; excluding the latter may miss opportunities to envision and design a more effective long-term care system for persons living with dementia and older adults.",

        "Abstract": "Although recent theories of consciousness have emerged to define what consciousness is, an under-represented aspect within this field remains: time consciousness. However, the subjective passage of time is modulated by changing experiences within different situational contexts and by self-awareness. The experience of silence influences our awareness of self, space, and time, and it impacts on psychological well-being. The present review describes how self and time are influenced by different situations of silence (pure silence indoors and outdoors, the \"just thinking\" situation, and the combination of silence with deep relaxation). Also, the changes in time experience during a \"forced\" waiting situation due to the COVID-19 lockdown are presented in order to highlight the role of boredom in waiting situations and in situations in which we are alone with \"our thoughts.\" Finally, in the context of the importance of creating silence through meditation practices, the alterations to one's sense of self and time during mindfulness meditation are reviewed. These studies are discussed within the framework of the cognitive models of prospective time perception, such as the attentional-gate model and the model of self-regulation and self-awareness.",

        "Abstract": "Boron (B) is a crucial element for efficient plant growth and development; therefore, B-based fertilisers have been employed in agricultural applications. The need for B-based fertilisers for agricultural uses is continuously increasing as a result of the world's growing population. It is expected that the global market for B-based fertiliser will grow by around $6.3 billion by 2032; hence, demand for B sources will also increase. In addition to being used in fertiliser, B is also employed in the production of neodymium iron B (NdFeB) permanent magnets. The demand for NdFeB magnets is also continuously increasing. Hence, it is of the utmost importance to reclaim B from secondary resources due to the rising demand for B in a wide variety of applications. This review study addresses the recovery of B from various waste streams. The main focus is on the recovery of B from spent NdFeB magnets, borax sludge, and liquid streams such as brine water, seawater, sewage, industrial wastewater, and agricultural effluents. Different technologies for B recovery are discussed, such as sorption, solvent extraction, membrane processes, precipitation, and hydrometallurgical methods. Solvent extraction has been found to be a very effective approach for reclaiming B from spent NdFeB magnet waste and from liquid streams with high B concentration (>1-2\u00a0g/L). Further, the application of B-based fertiliser in agriculture application is reviewed. Challenges associated with B recovery from waste streams and future perspectives are also highlighted in this review.",

        "Title": "Multivariate Neural Patterns of Reward and Anxiety in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa.",
        "Abstract": "People with anorexia nervosa (AN) commonly exhibit elevated anxiety and atypical reward responsiveness. To examine multivariate neural patterns associated with reward and the impact of anxiety on reward, we analyzed fMRI data from a monetary reward task using representational similarity analysis, a multivariate approach that measures trial-by-trial consistency of neural responses. Twenty-five adolescent girls with AN and 22 mildly anxious controls lacking any history of AN were presented personalized anxiety-provoking or neutral words before receiving a reward, and neural response patterns in reward regions were analyzed. Consistent with our preregistered hypothesis, AN participants showed lower representational similarity than controls during neutral-word rewarded trials. Within groups, controls showed significant representational similarity in reward circuit regions including the left nucleus accumbens, left basolateral amygdala, and left medial orbitofrontal cortex, which were not observed in AN. Further, reward-related prefrontal cognitive control areas - left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - showed significant representational similarity in both groups, but a larger spatial extent in controls. Contrary to predictions, there were no significant between-group differences for the effects of anxiety-words on reward representational similarity, and representational similarity did not predict longitudinal symptom change over six months. Overall, the results demonstrate relatively inconsistent trial-by-trial responses to reward receipt in the neutral state in AN compared with controls in both reward circuit and cognitive control regions, but no significant differential effects of anxiety states on reward responses. These results add to dynamic understandings of reward processing in AN that have potential implications for planning and guiding reward-focused interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Cervical cancer remains a significant but preventable threat to women's health throughout much of the developing world, including Uganda. Cervical cancer screening and timely treatment of pre-cancerous lesions is a cost-effective means of mitigating cervical cancer morbidity and mortality. However, only 5% of women in Uganda have ever been screened. Barriers to screening, such as social stigma and access to safe conditions, have been previously identified, but insights into the role of male spouses in encouraging or discouraging screening have been limited. To our knowledge, no studies have compared barriers and facilitators among women who had or had not yet been screened and male partners of screened and unscreened women.",

        "Abstract": "Drug repurposing in glomerular disease can deliver opportunities for steroid-free regimens, enable personalized multi-target options for resistant or relapsing disease and enhance treatment options for understudied populations (for example, children) and in resource-limited settings. Identification of drug-repurposing candidates can be data driven, which utilizes existing data on disease pathobiology, drug features and clinical outcomes, or experimental, which involves high-throughput drug screens. Information from databases of approved drugs, clinical trials and PubMed registries suggests that at least 96 drugs on the market cover 49 targets with immunosuppressive potential that could be candidates for drug repurposing in glomerular disease. Furthermore, evidence to support drug repurposing is available for 191 immune drug target-glomerular disease pairs. Non-immunological drug repurposing includes strategies to reduce haemodynamic overload, podocyte injury and kidney fibrosis. Recommended strategies to expand drug-repurposing capacity in glomerular disease include enriching drug databases with glomeruli-specific information, enhancing the accessibility of primary clinical trial data, biomarker discovery to improve participant selection into clinical trials and improve surrogate outcomes and initiatives to reduce patent, regulatory and organizational hurdles.",

        "Abstract": "Physical and chemical hydrogels are promising platforms for tissue engineering/regenerative medicine (TERM). In particular, physical hydrogels are suitable for use in the design of drug delivery systems owing to their reversibility and responsiveness to applied stimuli and external environment. Alternatively, the use of chemical hydrogels represents a better strategy to produce stable 3D constructs in the TERM field. In this work, these two strategies were combined to develop multi-functional formulations integrating both drug delivery potential and TERM approaches in a single device. Specifically, a novel photo-sensitive poly(ether urethane) (PEU) was developed to form supramolecular networks with \u03b1-cyclodextrins (\u03b1-CDs). The PEU was successfully synthesized using Poloxamer\u00ae 407, 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, as assessed by infrared spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (",

        "Abstract": "Perinatal depression has been shown to have deleterious effects on maternal post-partum functioning, as well as early child development. However, few studies have documented whether depression care helps to mitigate these effects. We examined the effects of the M-DEPTH (Maternal Depression Treatment in HIV) depression care model (including antidepressants and individual Problem Solving Therapy) on maternal functioning and infant development in the first 6 months post-delivery in an ongoing cluster randomized controlled trial of 391 HIV-infected women with at least mild depressive symptoms enrolled across eight antenatal care clinics in Uganda. A subsample of 354 (177 in each of the intervention and control groups) had a live birth delivery and comprised the analytic sample, of whom 69% had clinical depression at enrollment; 70% of women in the intervention group (including 96% of those with clinical depression) received depression treatment. Repeated-measures multivariable regression models found that the intervention group reported better infant care, lower parental burden, and greater perceived adequacy of parental support, compared to the control group. These findings suggest that depression care for pregnant women living with HIV is important not only for maternal mental health, but it also helps women to better manage parenting and care for their infant.",

However, the availability of dementia specialists is limited and varies across the United States. Using data from the Area Health Resources Files, we found that the median density of dementia specialists across hospital referral regions in United States is 28.8 per 100 000 population aged 65 years and older (interquartile range 19.3-43.6). We derived thresholds of 33-45 dementia specialists per 100 000 population aged 65 years and older as the provider density necessary to care for older adults with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Based on these thresholds, we estimated that 34%-59% of the population aged 65 years and older resided in areas with potential dementia specialist shortfalls. The extent of potential shortfalls varied by state and rurality. A better understanding of potential gaps in the availability of dementia specialists will inform policies and practices to ensure access to services for people with cognitive impairment and dementia.",

        "Abstract": "Multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs) have shown that timely triage expedites treatment. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) may help improve pulmonary embolism (PE) management with early CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) screening and accelerate PERT coordination. This study aimed to test the clinical validity of an FDA-approved PE AI algorithm. CTPA scan data of 200 patients referred due to automated AI detection of suspected PE were retrospectively reviewed. In our institution, all patients suspected of PE received a CTPA. The AI app was then used to analyze CTPA for the presence of PE and calculate the right-ventricle/left-ventricle (RV/LV) ratio. We compared the AI's output with the radiologists' report. Inclusion criteria included segmental PE with and without RV dysfunction and high-risk PE. The primary endpoint was false positive rate. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes according to the therapy selected, including catheter-directed interventions, systemic thrombolytics, and anticoagulation. Fifty-seven of 200 exams (28.5%) were correctly identified as positive for PE by the algorithm. A total of 143 exams (71.5%) were incorrectly reported as positive. In 8% of cases, PERT was consulted. Four patients (7%) received systemic thrombolytics without any complications. There were six patients (10.5%) who developed high-risk PE and underwent thrombectomy, one of whom died. Among 46 patients with acute PE without right heart strain, 44 (95%) survived. The false positive rate of our AI algorithm was 71.5%, higher than what was reported in the AI's prior clinical validity study (91% sensitivity, 100% specificity). A high rate of discordant AI auto-detection of suspected PE raises concerns about its diagnostic accuracy. This can lead to increased workloads for PERT consultants, alarm/notification fatigue, and automation bias. The AI direct notification process to the PERT team did not improve PERT triage efficacy.",

        "Title": "Liver biochemical indexes and cholesterol metabolism in cystic fibrosis patients with F508del/CFTR variant genotype after elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment.",
        "Abstract": "Modulators of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) improved cystic fibrosis (CF) patients' outcome. The elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) combination was safe and effective improving lung function in patients with different CFTR genotypes, including at least one F508del mutation. However, cases with liver damage were reported. We describe 105 CF patients heterozygous for F508del in trans with another CFTR mutation, treated for 1\u00a0year with ETI. We analyzed liver biochemical parameters and cholesterol metabolism, including lathosterol and phytosterols, surrogate markers of cholesterol de-novo synthesis and absorption, respectively. The treatment significantly improved sweat chloride, body mass index and forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s, whereas it caused a significant increase of total and conjugated bilirubin, ALT and GGT, even if no patients developed CF liver disease. Such alterations were less relevant than those previously observed in ETI-treated F508del homozygous patients. Furthermore, ETI treatment significantly increased serum cholesterol by enhancing its absorption (correlation between serum cholesterol and phytosterols). Whereas, we observed a normalization of de-novo biosynthesis (lathosterol reduction) that was not observed in homozygous patients. These data suggest that the second mutation in trans with the F508del contributes to reduce the liver cholesterol accumulation and thus, the triggering of liver inflammation. However, no differences in the alteration of biochemical indexes were observed between CF patients with and without liver steatosis, and between patients with different mutations in trans with the F508del. Such data suggest to further investigate the effects of ETI therapy on liver function indexes and new predictive biomarkers.",

        "Abstract": "Patellar failure in total knee arthroplasty is a major source of complications postoperatively. Previous patellar failure reports commonly cited dissociations of modular and metal-backed patellar implants. However, mechanical breakage of monoblock all-polyethylene patellar implants is very rare. We present a case of an early shear failure of a 3-peg modified dome all-polyethylene patellar implant at 16 months. The patient underwent a revision procedure and at 1-year follow-up, the patient's patella and knee remained stable with no reported issues. Shear failure of polyethylene pegs requires excess cyclic shear stress imparted at the prosthetic-bone interface. Patellar implants with a cone design are more constrained and, if misaligned relative to the metallic trochlea, may impart excess shear force to the patella during flexion.",

        "Abstract": "In a recent call to action, we described pressing issues in the health-service-psychology (HSP) internship from the perspective of interns. In our article, we sought to initiate a dialogue that would include trainees and bring about concrete changes. The commentaries on our article are a testament to the readiness of the field to engage in such a dialogue, and we applaud the actionable recommendations that they make. In our response to these commentaries, we seek to move the conversation further forward. We observe two themes that cut across these responses: the impetus to gather novel data on training (the \"need to know\") and the importance of taking action (the \"need to act\"). We emphasize that in new efforts to gather data and take policy-level action, the inclusion of trainee stakeholders (as well as others involved in and affected by HSP training) is a crucial ingredient for sustainable and equitable change.",

        "Abstract": "Since its inception 30\u00a0years ago, Photovoice has gained increasing popularity as a research method and more recently has been incorporated within randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs. Photovoice is a participatory action research method that pairs photography with focus group discussions to record community strengths and concerns, build critical consciousness, and reach policymakers. Adherence of Photovoice implementation to these original tenets of Photovoice varies. This article provides the Photovoice protocol developed by the authors to improve the methodological rigor of Photovoice integration into RCTs and help contextualize the landscape for the HEALing Communities Study (HCS: NCT04111939), a greater than $350 million investment by the National Institute on Drug Abuse along with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to reduce opioid overdose deaths in 67 of the hardest-hit communities in four states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio). The product of a cross-state collaboration, this HCS Photovoice protocol provides ethical and methodological tools for incorporating Photovoice into RCT designs to enhance community engagement, communication campaigns, and data-driven decision-making about evidence-based practice selection and implementation.",

        "Title": "Conformational Alterations of the Cell Surface of Monomeric and Dimeric \u03b22m-Free HLA-I (Proto-HLA) May Enable Novel Immune Functions in Health and Disease.",
        "Abstract": "Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are polymorphic glycoproteins expressed on the cell surface of nucleated cells and consist of two classes, HLA class I and HLA class II. In contrast, in mice, these molecules, known as H-2, are expressed on both nucleated cells and erythrocytes. HLA-I molecules (Face-1) are heterodimers consisting of a polypeptide heavy chain (HC) and a light chain, B2-microglobulin (B2m). The heterodimers bind to antigenic peptides and present them to the T-cell receptors of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The HCs can also independently emerge on the cell surface as B2m-free HC monomers without peptides (Face-2). Early investigators suggested that the occurrence of B2m-free HCs on the cell surface resulted from the dissociation of B2m from Face-1. However, others documented the independent emergence of B2m-free HCs (Face-2) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface. The clustering of such HC molecules on either the cell surface or on exosomes resulted in the dimerization of B2m-free HCs to form homodimers (if the same allele, designated as Face-3) or heterodimers (if different alleles, designated as Face-4). Face-2 occurs at low levels on the cell surface of several normal cells but is upregulated on immune cells upon activation by proinflammatory cytokines and other agents such as anti-CD3 antibodies, phytohemagglutinin, and phorbol myristate acetate. Their density on the cell surface remains high as long as the cells remain activated. After activation-induced upregulation, Face-2 molecules undergo homo- and heterodimerization (Face-3 and Face-4). Observations made on the structural patterns of HCs and their dimerization in sharks, fishes, and tetrapod species suggest that the formation of B2m-free HC monomers and dimers is a recapitalization of a phylogenetically conserved event, befitting the term Proto-HLA for the B2m-free HCs. Spontaneous arthritis occurs in HLA-B27+ mice lacking B2m (HLA-B27+ B2m-/-) but not in HLA-B27+ B2m+/+ mice. Anti-HC-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) delay disease development. Some HLA-I polyreactive mAbs (MEM series) used for immunostaining confirm the existence of B2m-free variants in several cancer cells. The conformational alterations that occur in the B2m-free HCs enable them to interact with several inhibitory and activating receptors of cellular components of the innate (natural killer (NK) cells) and adaptive (T and B cells) immune systems. The NK cells express killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), whereas leukocytes (T and B lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells) express leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs). The KIRs and LILRs include activating and inhibitory members within their respective groups. This review focuses on the interaction of KIRs and LILRs with B2m-free HC monomers and dimers in patients with spondylarthritis. Several investigations reveal that the conformational alterations occurring in the alpha-1 and alpha-2 domains of B2m-free HCs may facilitate immunomodulation by their interaction with KIR and LILR receptors. This opens new avenues to immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases and even human cancers that express B2m-free HCs.",

        "Abstract": "Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after heart transplantation. CAV is often diagnosed in later stages or during routine screening in asymptomatic subjects. Myocardial work (MW), calculated using left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) and systemic blood pressure, may be associated with the presence of CAV and outperform conventional echocardiographic parameters. In this retrospective observational study, heart transplant recipients who underwent regular follow-up at our institution between May 2022 and September 2023 were enrolled. All included patients underwent speckle-tracking echocardiography, including MW indexes. CAV was classified according to invasive coronary angiography or computed tomography performed within 12 months of index echocardiography. We collected all available clinical and echocardiographic parameters and evaluated the potential association with CAV. CAV was detected in 29 of 93 patients (31%) (CAV+). Of the MW indexes, the mean global work efficiency (GWE) was 90 \u00b1 6% and was significantly lower in CAV+ than CAV- subjects (86 \u00b1 7% vs 91 \u00b1 4%, p <0.001). GWE (OR 0.86, CI 0.77 to 0.94, p = 0.002), E/e' ratio (OR 1.27, CI 1.08 to 1.52, p = 0.006), and left ventricular ejection fraction (OR 0.90; CI 0.81 to 0.98, p = 0.017) were independently associated with the presence of CAV. GWE (GWE vs LV-GLS, delta area under the curve 0.154, p = 0.047) and the proposed model (GWE+E/e' vs LV-GLS, delta area under the curve 0.198, p = 0.004) were significantly superior in stratifying the incremental risk for CAV compared with LV-GLS. In conclusion, GWE was observed to be independently associated with the presence of CAV. MW could represent a novel noninvasive screening method for CAV in heart transplant recipients. Larger and prospective studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

        "Title": "Evaluating MONICA's capability to simulate water, carbon and nitrogen fluxes in a wet grassland at contrasting water tables.",
        "Abstract": "Wet grasslands, which are vital for water and nutrient regulation, are characterised by distinct water, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics, and their interactions. Due to their shallow groundwater table, wet grasslands promote a strong interconnection between diverse vegetation and soil water. Researchers have investigated how wet grasslands respond to environmental changes, using various simulation models to understand how these sites contribute to water, C and N dynamics. However, a comprehensive, simultaneous study of all three of these dynamics is still lacking. This study makes use of a grassland lysimeter study with differently managed groundwater levels and employs the process-based MOdel for NItrogen and Carbon dynamics in Agroecosystems (MONICA) to simulate these dynamics. By using SPOTPY (Statistical Parameter Optimization Tool) to optimise the relevant parameters, we find that MONICA performs well in simulating vegetation growth (aboveground biomass), and elements of the water (evapotranspiration), C (gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration) and N (N in aboveground biomass, nitrate in soil solution, Nitrous oxide emissions) balance, with Willmott's Refined Index of Agreement always larger than 0.35. This level of accuracy demonstrates that MONICA is ready to be applied for scenario simulations of groundwater management and climate change to evaluate their impact on greenhouse gas emissions and long-term carbon storage, as well as water and nitrogen losses in wet grasslands.",

        "Title": "The swine waste resistome: Spreading and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in Escherichia coli strains and the associated microbial communities.",
        "Abstract": "The overuse of antimicrobials in livestock farming has led to the development of resistant bacteria and the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) among animals. When manure containing these antibiotics is applied to agricultural fields, it creates a selective pressure that promotes the acquisition of ARGs by bacteria, primarily through horizontal gene transfer. Most research on ARGs focuses on their role in clinical antibiotic resistance and their transfer from environmental sources to bacteria associated with humans, such as Escherichia coli. The study investigates the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) through class 1 integrons in 27 Escherichia coli strains from pig manure. It focuses on six common ARGs (ermB, cmlA, floR, qnrS, tetA, and TEM) and the class 1 integron gene, assessing their prevalence in manure samples from three pig farms. The study found correlations and anticorrelations among these genes, indicating a predisposition of the integron in spreading certain ARGs. Specifically, cmlA and tetA genes were positively correlated with each other and negatively with int1, suggesting they are not transferred via Int1. Farm B had the highest int1 counts and a higher abundance of the TEM gene, but lower levels of cmlA and tetA genes. The results underscore the complexity of predicting ARG spread in agricultural environments and the associated health risks to humans through the food chain. The study's results offer valuable insights into the antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) profile in swine livestock, potentially aiding in the development of methods to trace ARGs in the environment.",

        "Abstract": "Most patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have limited treatment options following standard-of-care therapy. VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in mCRC in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly in patients without liver metastases. The TKI zanzalintinib (XL092) targets VEGFR, MET and TAM kinases, proteins that are involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. Zanzalintinib has immunomodulatory properties that may enhance response to ICIs. Presented is the design of STELLAR-303, a global, phase III, open-label, randomized study evaluating zanzalintinib plus atezolizumab versus regorafenib in patients with non-MSI-H mCRC who progressed during/after or are refractory/intolerant to standard-of-care therapy. The primary end point is overall survival in patients without liver metastases.",

        "Abstract": "There are great concerns for the accumulation in the environment of small dimension plastics, such as micro- and nanoplastics. Due to their small size, which facilitates their uptake by organisms, nanoplastics are of particular concern. The toxic effects of nanoplastics on plants are already reported in the literature, however nothing is known, to date, about the possible effects of climate change, in particular of increasing temperatures, on their toxicity for plants. To address this issue, plants of the water fern Azolla filiculoides were grown at optimal (25\u00a0\u00b0C) or high (35\u00a0\u00b0C) temperature, with or without polystyrene nanoplastics, and the effects of these stressors were assessed using a multidisciplinary approach. Green fluorescent polystyrene nanoplastics were used to track their possible uptake by A. filiculoides. The development and physiology of our model plant was adversely affected by both nanoplastics and high temperatures. Overall, histological, morphological, and photosynthetic parameters worsened under co-treatment, in accordance with the increased uptake of nanoplastics under higher temperature, as observed by fluorescence images. Based on our findings, the concern regarding the potential for increased toxicity of pollutants, specifically nanoplastics, at high temperatures is well-founded and warrants attention as a potential negative consequence of climate change. Additionally, there is cause for concern regarding the increase in nanoplastic uptake at high temperatures, particularly if this phenomenon extends to food and feed crops, which could lead to greater entry into the food chain.",

        "Title": "Applications of optical sensing and imaging spectroscopy in indoor farming: A systematic review.",
        "Abstract": "As demand for food continues to rise, innovative methods are needed to sustainably and efficiently meet the growing pressure on agriculture. Indoor farming and controlled environment agriculture have emerged as promising approaches to address this challenge. However, optimizing fertilizer usage, ensuring homogeneous production, and reducing agro-waste remain substantial challenges in these production systems. One potential solution is the use of optical sensing technology, which can provide real-time data to help growers make informed decisions and enhance their operations. optical sensing can be used to analyze plant tissues, evaluate crop quality and yield, measure nutrients, and assess plant responses to stress. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the current state of using spectral-optical sensors and hyperspectral imaging for indoor farming, following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The study surveyed existing studies from 2017 to 2023 to identify gaps in knowledge, provide researchers and farmers with current trends, and offer recommendations and inspirations for possible new research directions. The results of this review will contribute to the development of sustainable and efficient methods of food production.",

        "Abstract": "Mobile populations such as fisherfolk show high HIV incidence and prevalence. We pilot-tested implementation strategies to enhance pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence in the context of healthcare outreach events in two mainland fisherfolk communities on Lake Victoria, Uganda from September 2021 to February 2022. The implementation strategies included PrEP adherence supporters (selected from PrEP users' social networks), community workshops (to address misconceptions and stigma, and empower PrEP advocacy), and check-in calls (including refill reminders). PrEP medical records data were collected from 6-months pre-intervention to 6-months post-intervention. Qualitative interviews with 20 PrEP users (10 who continued, 10 who discontinued), 9 adherence supporters, and 7 key\u00a0partners (providers, community leaders) explored acceptability. Percentages of PrEP initiators (of those eligible) were significantly higher during the intervention (96.5%) than 6-months before the intervention (84.5%), p\u2009<\u20090.0001; percentages of PrEP users who persisted (i.e.,\u00a0possessed a refill) 6-months post-initiation (47.9% vs. 6.7%) and had at least 80% PrEP coverage (based on their\u00a0medication possession ratio) from the initiation date to 6-months later (35.9% vs. 0%) were higher during versus pre-intervention, p\u2009<\u20090.0001. A comparison fisherfolk community with better healthcare access had lower uptake (78.3%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and persistence at 6-months (34.0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001), but higher coverage during the intervention period (70.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Qualitative data suggested the strategies promoted PrEP use through reduced stigma and misconceptions. The intervention bundle cost was $223.95, $172.98, and $94.66 for each additional person for PrEP initiation, persistence, and coverage, respectively. Enhanced community-based PrEP implementation that fosters a supportive community environment can improve PrEP use in mobile populations without easy access to healthcare. (NCT05084716).",

        "Abstract": "Clinical guidelines direct healthcare professionals toward evidence-based practices. Evaluating guideline impact can elucidate information penetration, relevance, effectiveness, and alignment with evolving medical knowledge and technological advancements. As the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Section on Tumors marks its 40th anniversary in 2024, this article reflects on the tumor guidelines established by the Section over the past decade and explores their impact on other publications, patents, and information dissemination. Six tumor guideline categories were reviewed: low-grade glioma, newly diagnosed glioblastoma, progressive glioblastoma, metastatic brain tumors, vestibular schwannoma, and pituitary adenomas. Citation data were collected from Google Scholar and PubMed. Further online statistics, such as social media reach, and features in policy, news, and patents were sourced from Altmetric. Online engagement was assessed through website and CNS+ mobile application visits. Data were normalized to time since publication. Metastatic Tumor guidelines (2019) had the highest PubMed citation rate at 26.1 per year and webpage visits (29\u2009100 page views 1/1/2019-9/30/2023). Notably, this guideline had two endorsement publications by partner societies, the Society of Neuro-Oncology and American Society of Clinical Oncology, concerning antiepileptic prophylaxis and steroid use, and the greatest reach on X (19.7 mentions/y). Citation rates on Google Scholar were led by Vestibular Schwannoma (2018). Non-Functioning Pituitary Adenoma led Mendeley reads. News, patent, or policy publications were led by low-grade glioma at 1.5/year. Our study shows that the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Section on Tumors guidelines go beyond citations in peer-reviewed publications to include patents, online engagement, and information dissemination to the public.",

        "Abstract": "Jumping is an important task in skiing, snowboarding, ski jumping, figure skating, volleyball and many other sports. In these examples, jumping tasks are a performance criterion, and therefore detailed insight into them is important for athletes and coaches. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce a simple and easy-to-implement jump detection algorithm for skiing using acceleration data from inertial measurement units attached to ski boots. The algorithm uses the average of the absolute vertical accelerations of the two boots. We provide results for different parameter settings of the algorithm and two types of jumps: Big Air jumps and jumps during skiing. The latter are divided into small (time of flight < 500 ms) and medium (time of flight \u2265 500 ms) jumps. The algorithm detects 100% of Big Air, 94% of medium and 44% of small jumps. In addition, the settings with the highest detection rates also have the highest number of overdetected jumps. To resolve this conflict, a penalty-adjusted score that considers the number of overdetected jumps in the final performance analysis is proposed.",

Eventually, disturbances in the embryological/fetal development path facilitate the occurrence of scrotal hernia, a congenital malformation characterized by the presence of intestinal portions within the scrotal sac due to the abnormal expansion of the inguinal ring. In pigs, some genes have been related to this anomaly, but the genetic mechanisms involved remain unclear.

        "Title": "Psychosocial issues and quality of life associated with food allergy.",
        "Abstract": "The day-to-day challenges involved in caring for a child with food allergies can be a significant stress within a family. As the child with a food allergy grows up, developmental changes as well as external influences such as bullying and peer pressure can further influence these stressors. When the child with a food allergy is young, the family may be limited on where they can vacation or go out to restaurants, which can cause tension and frustration within the family. Hypervigilance and fear of accidental exposure to the allergen takes an emotional and physical toll on the child with a food allergy and the child's family. Socially, children with a food allergy may have to limit participation in school events, parties, or camps. These limitations can cause feelings of isolation for the child and feelings of guilt for the parents. As the child becomes an adolescent and young adult (AYA), increased autonomy of dining options and a desire to fit in with peers can trigger higher risk-taking behavior, which can be a source of anxiety for the AYA as well as the caregivers. The aim of this review was to describe potential negative psychosocial impacts of having a food allergy for the family. Data were reviewed from a literature search of medical literature data bases between 2010 and 2020 by using the search terms \"food allergy,\" \"psychosocial,\" \"anxiety,\" and\" quality of life.\" As we better recognize the psychosocial issues associated with food allergies, we will have a better ability to develop effective interventions to improve the quality of life for these families.",

        "Abstract": "This study compared the effects of a low-fat vegan diet to those of a portion-controlled diet in people with type 1 diabetes. Over 12 weeks, the average total daily dose of insulin decreased significantly and insulin sensitivity increased significantly in the vegan group, while no significant changes were observed in the group receiving the portion-controlled diet. Total and LDL cholesterol decreased in the vegan group, as did the ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine. A1C decreased in both groups. These findings suggest that a low-fat vegan diet may yield improvements in insulin sensitivity, insulin requirements, glycemic control, and markers of cardiovascular and renal health compared with a portion-controlled diet in people with type 1 diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUNDMetastases are the hallmark of lethal cancer, though underlying mechanisms that drive metastatic spread to specific organs remain poorly understood. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is known to have distinct sites of metastases, with lung, bone, liver, and lymph nodes being more common than brain, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine glands. Previous studies have shown varying clinical behavior and prognosis associated with the site of metastatic spread; however, little is known about the molecular underpinnings that contribute to the differential outcomes observed by the site of metastasis.METHODSWe analyzed primary renal tumors and tumors derived from metastatic sites to comprehensively characterize genomic and transcriptomic features of tumor cells as well as to evaluate the tumor microenvironment at both sites.RESULTSWe included a total of 657 tumor samples (340 from the primary site [kidney] and 317 from various sites of metastasis). We show distinct genomic alterations, transcriptomic signatures, and immune and stromal tumor microenvironments across metastatic sites in a large cohort of patients with RCC.CONCLUSIONWe demonstrate significant heterogeneity among primary tumors and metastatic sites and elucidate the complex interplay between tumor cells and the extrinsic tumor microenvironment that is vital for developing effective anticancer therapies.",

        "Title": "Impact of debulking therapy on the clinical outcomes of axicabtagene ciloleucel in the treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.",
        "Abstract": "Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, was approved for relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) based on the results from pivotal Cohorts 1+2 of ZUMA-1 (NCT02348216). ZUMA-1 was expanded to investigate safety management strategies aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events (NEs). Prospective safety expansion Cohort 5 evaluated the impact of debulking therapy, including rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy regimens and radiotherapy, in axi-cel-treated patients; the CRS and NE management strategy paralleled those in Cohorts 1+2. Among the 50 patients in Cohort 5 who received axi-cel, 40% received \u22653 prior lines of chemotherapy, and 40% had disease that progressed while on the most recent chemotherapy. Forty-eight patients (96%) received debulking therapy, 14 (28%) radiotherapy only, and 34 (71%) systemic immunochemotherapy. Median decrease in tumor burden (per sum of product of diameters of target lesions) relative to screening was 17.4% with R-ICE/R-GDP, 4.3% with other debulking chemotherapies, and 6.3% with radiotherapy only. All patients were followed for \u22658 months. CRS was reported in 43 patients (86%), with 1 patient (2%) experiencing grade \u22653. NEs were reported in 28 patients (56%), with 6 (12%) experiencing grade \u22653. Cytopenias were the most frequent grade \u22653 adverse event (AE); 19 (38%) and 18 (36%) treated patients had any and grade \u22653 prolonged thrombocytopenia, respectively, and 25 (50%) and 24 (48%) patients had any and grade \u22653 prolonged neutropenia, respectively. Overall, patients who received debulking chemotherapy had higher incidences of serious treatment-emergent AEs than those who received radiotherapy only. At the 24-month analysis, objective response rate was 72%, and complete response rate was 56%. Median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 25.8, 3.1, and 20.6 months, respectively. These results from exploratory Cohort 5 demonstrate the feasibility of debulking prior to axi-cel, and together with current real-world evidence, suggest that debulking regimens may help minimize the frequency and severity of CRS and NEs in patients with R/R LBCL. The incidence of other AEs observed in Cohort 5 suggest the risk/benefit profile was not improved via the debulking regimens studied here.",

        "Abstract": "Cell cycle progression is regulated by the orderly balance between kinase and phosphatase activities. PP2A phosphatase holoenzymes containing the B55 family of regulatory B subunits function as major CDK1-counteracting phosphatases during mitotic exit in mammals. However, the identification of the specific mitotic roles of these PP2A-B55 complexes has been hindered by the existence of multiple B55 isoforms. Here, through the generation of loss-of-function genetic mouse models for the two ubiquitous B55 isoforms (B55\u03b1 and B55\u03b4), we report that PP2A-B55\u03b1 and PP2A-B55\u03b4 complexes display overlapping roles in controlling the dynamics of proper chromosome individualization and clustering during mitosis. In the absence of PP2A-B55 activity, mitotic cells display increased chromosome individualization in the presence of enhanced phosphorylation and perichromosomal loading of Ki-67. These data provide experimental evidence for a regulatory mechanism by which the balance between kinase and PP2A-B55 phosphatase activity controls the Ki-67-mediated spatial organization of the mass of chromosomes during mitosis.",

        "Title": "Pro-inflammatory protein S100A9 targeted by a natural molecule to prevent neurodegeneration onset.",
        "Abstract": "Accumulation of the pro-inflammatory protein S100A9 has been implicated in neuroinflammatory cascades in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). S100A9 co-aggregates with other proteins such as \u03b1-synuclein in PD and A\u03b2 in AD, contributing to amyloid plaque formation and neurotoxicity. The amyloidogenic nature of this protein and its role in chronic neuroinflammation suggest that it may play a key role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Research into molecules targeting S100A9 could be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent its amyloidogenic self-assembly and to attenuate the neuroinflammatory response in affected brain tissue. This work suggests that bioactive natural molecules, such as those found in the Mediterranean diet, may have the potential to alleviate neuroinflammation associated with the accumulation of proteins such as S100A9 in neurodegenerative diseases. A major component of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), hydroxytyrosol (HT), with its ability to interact with and modulate S100A9 amyloid self-assembly and expression, offers a compelling approach for the development of novel and effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of ND. The findings highlight the importance of exploring natural compounds, such as HT, as potential therapeutic options for these complex and challenging neurological conditions.",

        "Abstract": "This article focuses on the emergence of cooperation in societies of self-interested agents. In particular, it introduces a mechanism based on indirect-stigmergic-interactions between agents moving in an environment, to express the likeliness of finding cooperative partners. On the one hand, agents that find themselves cooperating with others emit pheromones in their current location, expressing the presence of agents willing to cooperate. On the other hand, agents that sense pheromones tend to move towards regions with a higher pheromone concentration. Results show that this mechanism leads to the emergence of spatial regions where cooperation can be effectively sustained, and in which agents can overall get better payoffs than those agents not taking into account pheromones in their choices.",

        "Title": "Drug delivery in leptomeningeal disease: Navigating barriers and beyond.",
        "Abstract": "Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) refers to the infiltration of cancer cells into the leptomeningeal compartment. Leptomeninges are the two membranous layers, called the arachnoid membrane and pia mater. The diffuse nature of LMD poses a challenge to its effective diagnosis and successful management. Furthermore, the predominant phenotype; solid masses or freely floating cells, has altering implications on the effectiveness of drug delivery systems. The standard of care is the intrathecal delivery of chemotherapy drugs but it is associated with increased instances of treatment-related complications, low patient compliance, and suboptimal drug distribution. An alternative involves administering the drugs systemically, after which they must traverse fluid barriers to arrive at their destination within the leptomeningeal space. However, this route is known to cause off-target effects as well as produce subtherapeutic drug concentrations at the target site within the central nervous system. The development of new drug delivery systems such as liposomal cytarabine has improved drug delivery in leptomeningeal metastatic disease, but much still needs to be done to effectively target this challenging condition. In this review, we discuss about the anatomy of leptomeninges relevant for drug penetration, the conventional and advanced drug delivery methods for LMD. We also discuss the future directions being set by different clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "Pharmacogenetics investigates sequence of genes that affect drug response, enabling personalized medication. This approach reduces drug-induced adverse reactions and improves clinical effectiveness, making it a crucial consideration for personalized medical care. Numerous guidelines, drawn by global consortia and scientific organizations, codify genotype-driven administration for over 120 active substances. As the scientific community acknowledges the benefits of genotype-tailored therapy over traditionally agnostic drug administration, the push for its implementation into Italian healthcare system is gaining momentum. This evolution is influenced by several factors, including the improved access to patient genotypes, the sequencing costs decrease, the growing of large-scale genetic studies, the rising popularity of direct-to-consumer pharmacogenetic tests, and the continuous improvement of pharmacogenetic guidelines. Since EMA (European Medicines Agency) and AIFA (Italian Medicines Agency) provide genotype information on drug leaflet without clear and explicit clinical indications for gene testing, the regulation of pharmacogenetic testing is a pressing matter in Italy. In this manuscript, we have reviewed how to overcome the obstacles in implementing pharmacogenetic testing in the clinical practice of the Italian healthcare system. Our particular emphasis has been on germline testing, given the absence of well-defined national directives in contrast to somatic pharmacogenetics.",

        "Abstract": "Inguinal lymph node dissection plays an important role in the management of melanoma, penile and vulval cancer. Inguinal lymph node dissection is associated with various intraoperative and postoperative complications with significant heterogeneity in classification and reporting. This lack of standardization challenges efforts to study and report inguinal lymph node dissection outcomes. The aim of this study was to devise a system to standardize the classification and reporting of inguinal lymph node dissection perioperative complications by creating a worldwide collaborative, the complications and adverse events in lymphadenectomy of the inguinal area (CALI) group.",

        "Title": "Upcoming Italian clinical practice guidelines on endoscopic bariatric treatment of overweight and obesity: design and methodological aspects.",
        "Abstract": "Obesity/overweight and its complications are a growing problem in many countries. Italian Society of Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery for Obesity (Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Chirurgia dell'Obesit\u00e0 e delle Malattie Metaboliche-SICOB) decided to develop the first Italian guidelines for the endoscopic bariatric treatment of obesity. The creation of SICOB Guidelines is based on an extended work made by a panel of 44 members and a coordinator. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology has been used to decide the aims, reference population, and target health professionals. Clinical questions have been created using the PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) conceptual framework. We will perform systematic reviews, formal meta-analyses, and network meta-analyses for each PICO and critical outcomes aimed at assessing and rating the efficacy and safety of endoscopic bariatric procedures in comparison with either no interventions, lifestyle interventions, or approved anti-obesity treatments in trials with a follow-up of at least 52 weeks. For PICO on temporary endoscopic bariatric treatments, we will also consider RCT with a minimum duration of 6 months. The panel proposed 8 questions, organized into four domains: A. Indication for endoscopic bariatric surgery; B. Revisional surgery; C. Temporary gastric and duodenal-jejunal procedures; D. Endoscopic diagnosis/treatment of bariatric and metabolic surgery complications. These guidelines will apply to patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200914 years) with body mass index (BMI)\u2009\u2265\u200927 kg/m",

We sought to develop recommendations for Malawi as a test case since it has the second-highest cervical cancer burden globally and high HIV prevalence. We incorporated updated epidemiologic data, the full range of ablation methods recommended, and a more nuanced representation of how HIV status intersects with cervical cancer risk and exposure to screening to model outcomes of different approaches to screening.",

        "Abstract": "Skeletal muscle, the major processor of dietary glucose, stores it in myriad glycogen granules. Their numbers vary with cellular location and physiological and pathophysiological states. AI models were developed to derive granular glycogen content from electron-microscopic images of human muscle. Two UNet-type semantic segmentation models were built: \"Locations\" classified pixels as belonging to different regions in the cell; \"Granules\" identified pixels within granules. From their joint output, a pixel fraction pf was calculated for images from patients positive (MHS) or negative (MHN) to a test for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. pf was used to derive vf, the volume fraction occupied by granules. The relationship vf (pf) was derived from a simulation of volumes (\"baskets\") containing virtual granules at realistic concentrations. The simulated granules had diameters matching the real ones, which were measured by adapting a utility devised for calcium sparks. Applying this relationship to the pf measured in images, vf was calculated for every region and patient, and from them a glycogen concentration. The intermyofibrillar spaces and the sarcomeric I band had the highest granular content. The measured glycogen concentration was low enough to allow for a substantial presence of non-granular glycogen. The MHS samples had an approximately threefold lower concentration (significant in a hierarchical test), consistent with earlier evidence of diminished glucose processing in MHS. The AI models and the approach to infer three-dimensional magnitudes from two-dimensional images should be adaptable to other tasks on a variety of images from patients and animal models and different disease conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Beyond Bias was an intervention introduced in Burkina Faso, Pakistan and Tanzania, with the aim of reducing health worker bias toward young, unmarried and nulliparous women seeking family planning services. This study used qualitative methods - based on interviews with health workers who participated in the intervention, managers at health facilities that participated in the intervention, and policy and program stakeholders at the national level - to understand implementation experiences with the intervention. The results offer insights for organizations or countries seeking to implement Beyond Bias or similar programs, and point to some other key implementation challenges for multi-component interventions in lower-resource settings. The intervention, developed using a human-centered design approach, was seen as key for successful implementation but there were logistical challenges. The digital intervention was disruptive and distracting to many. In addition, the non-financial rewards intervention was perceived as complex, and some participants expressed feeling discouraged when they did not receive a reward. Beyond Bias did not sufficiently attend to the \"outer setting,\" and this was perceived as a major implementation barrier as it limited individuals' capacity to fully achieve the desired behavior change; for example, space constraints meant that some health facilities could not ensure private services for all clients. There were scalability concerns related to cost, and there is uncertainty whether diversity of contexts (within and across countries) might constrain implementation of Beyond Bias at scale.",

        "Abstract": "The Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality Healthcare Innovations Exchange (IE) was developed to collect and report on innovative approaches to improving health care. The team reviewed 348 IE innovations including patient-reported satisfaction or experience measures. Innovations most often measured overall rating of care (61% of innovations), followed by access (52%) and provider-patient communication (12%). More than half used patient satisfaction surveys (n = 187) rather than patient experience surveys (n = 64). Innovations using patient experience surveys more often measured specific aspects of patient care, for example, access, versus a general overall rating of care. Most innovations using patient experience surveys administered nonvalidated, homegrown surveys, with few using the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality-endorsed, psychometrically-tested CAHPS (Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) survey. The most common study design was postimplementation-only (65%), highlighting that methodological rigor used to assess patient-centeredness in the IE is low. Broad use of patient experience surveys and more rigorous evaluation study designs has increased some over time but is still lacking.",

        "Abstract": "To quantify the clinical unmet need of r/r MCL patients who progress on a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), we conducted a systematic review to identify studies that reported overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or response outcomes of patients who received a chemo(immunotherapy)\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0targeted agent standard therapy (STx) or brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) in the post-BTKi setting. Twenty-six studies (23 observational; three trials) reporting outcomes from 2005 to 2022 were included. Using two-stage frequentist meta-analyses, the estimated median PFS/OS for patients treated with an STx was 7.6\u00a0months (95% CI: 3.9-14.6) and 9.1\u00a0months (95% CI: 7.3-11.3), respectively. The estimated objective response rate (ORR) was 45% (95% CI: 34-57%). For patients treated with brexu-cel, the estimated median PFS/OS was 14.9\u00a0months (95% CI: 10.5-21.0) and 32.1\u00a0months (95% CI: 25.2-41.2), with a pooled ORR of 89% (95% CI: 86-91%). Our findings highlight a significant unmet need for patients whose disease progresses on a covalent BTKi.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) can be strongly potentiated by the addition of the non-toxic inorganic salt, potassium iodide (KI). This approach was shown to apply to many different photosensitizers, including the xanthene dye Rose Bengal (RB) excited by green light (540\u00a0nm). Rose Bengal diacetate (RBDA) is a lipophilic RB derivative that is easily taken up by cells and hydrolyzed to produce an active photosensitizer. Because KI is not taken up by microbial cells, it was of interest to see if aPDI mediated by RBDA could also be potentiated by KI. The addition of 100 mM KI strongly potentiated the killing of Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylocccus aureus, Gram-negative Eschericia coli, and fungal yeast Candida albicans when treated with RBDA (up to 15 \u00b5M) for 2 hours followed by green light (540\u00a0nm, 10\u00a0J/cm",

        "Abstract": "Dengel, DR, Studee, HR, Juckett, WT, Bosch, TA, Carbuhn, AF, Stanforth, PR, and Evanoff, NG. Muscle-to-bone ratio in NCAA Division I collegiate football players by position. J Strength Cond Res 38(9): 1607-1612, 2024-The purpose of this study was to compare the muscle-to-bone ratio (MBR) in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I football players (collegiate football players [CFP]) to healthy, age-matched controls. In addition, we examined MBR in CFP by position. A total of 553 CFP and 261 controls had their total and regional lean mass (LM), fat mass (FM), and bone mineral content (BMC) determined by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). College football players were categorized by positions defined as offensive linemen (OL), defensive linemen (DL), tight end, linebacker (LB), running back (RB), punter or kicker, quarterback (QB), defensive back (DB), and wide receiver (WR). There were significant differences between CFP and controls for total LM (80.1 \u00b1 10.0 vs. 56.9 \u00b1 7.8 kg), FM (22.2 \u00b1 12.5 vs. 15.2 \u00b1 7.1 kg), and BMC (4.3 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 3.1 \u00b1 0.5 kg). Although there were significant differences in body composition between CFP and controls, there was no significant differences in total MBR between CFP and controls (18.6 \u00b1 1.4 vs. 18.8 \u00b1 1.7). Regionally, CFP had significantly lower trunk MBR than controls (26.7 \u00b1 2.7 vs. 28.7 \u00b1 4.2), but no difference was seen in leg or arm MBR. Positional differences in CFP were noted as total MBR being significantly higher in DL (19.0 \u00b1 1.4) than in DB (18.1 \u00b1 1.3), WR (18.1 \u00b1 1.3), and LB (18.2 \u00b1 1.3). OL had a significantly higher total MBR (19.2 \u00b1 1.3) than DB (18.1 \u00b1 1.3), LB (18.2 \u00b1 1.3), QB (18.1 \u00b1 1.0), and WR (18.1 \u00b1 1.3). In addition, RB had significantly higher total MBR (18.8 \u00b1 1.3) than DB (18.1 \u00b1 1.3) and WR (18.1 \u00b1 1.3). This study may provide athletes and training staff with normative values when evaluating total and regional MBR with DXA.",

The endonasal access guide (EAG) has been demonstrated as a possible adjunct to minimize these events. However, to date, there have been no comparative studies performed and the potential time savings by using EAGs have yet to be quantified. This cohort study aimed to determine the operative efficiency benefits of the EAG in EEA operations.",

        "Title": "An Overview on the Management of Atrophic Acne Scars: The Role of Trifarotene as an Adjunct.",
        "Abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a common, often chronic inflammatory disease that can affect all ages and skin tones. Beyond acute lesions, the sequelae of acne - specifically scarring and dyspigmentation - can be long-lasting, challenging to treat and have substantial psychosocial impact on affected individuals. For acne scarring, treatment modalities include topical, physical, and laser and light therapies, with combination approaches typically yielding optimal outcomes. Trifarotene is a novel fourth generation retinoid with targeted action towards retinoid acid receptor gamma (RAR-\u03b3), the most common isotype found in the epidermis, that has previously been approved for the management of moderate-to-severe facial and truncal acne in individuals over the age of 12 years. Recently, data on trifarotene supports its application in acne scarring. Herein, we provide a succinct review on various treatments for acne scarring and explore how trifarotene and its mechanism of action present an additional topical approach to target atrophic acne scarring.",

        "Abstract": "Thousands of prolonged sequences of human ultra-conserved non-coding elements (UCNEs) share only one common feature: peculiarities in the unique composition of their dinucleotides. Here we investigate whether the numerous weak signals emanating from these dinucleotide arrangements can be used for computational identification of UCNEs within the human genome. For this purpose, we analyzed 4272 UCNE sequences, encompassing 1\u2009393\u2009448 nucleotides, alongside equally sized control samples of randomly selected human genomic sequences. Our research identified nine different features of dinucleotide arrangements that enable differentiation of UCNEs from the rest of the genome. We employed these nine features, implementing three Machine Learning techniques - Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks - to classify UCNEs, achieving an accuracy rate of 82-84%, with specific conditions allowing for over 90% accuracy. Notably, the strongest feature for UCNE identification was the frequency ratio between GpC dinucleotides and the sum of GpG and CpC dinucleotides. Additionally, we investigated the entire pool of 31\u2009046 SNPs located within UCNEs for their representation in the ClinVar database, which catalogs human SNPs with known phenotypic effects. The presence of UCNE-associated SNPs in ClinVar aligns with the expectation of a random distribution, emphasizing the enigmatic nature of UCNE phenotypic manifestation.",

However, gaps remain about how to best sustain EBPs in treatment organizations in the U.S., especially in resource-constrained settings like publicly-funded youth substance use services. One important, but understudied, determinant of EBP sustainment is alignment: the extent to which multi-level factors that influence sustainment processes and outcomes are congruent, consistent, and/or coordinated. This study examined the role of alignment in U.S. states' efforts to sustain the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA), an EBP for youth substance use disorders, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "Abstract": "Global methylation analysis of gene promoters is promising for detection of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse (HSIL+) in high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-positive women. However, diagnostic performance of methylation data at individual CpG-sites is limited. We explored methylation for predicting HSIL+ in self- and clinician-collected samples from Papua New Guinea. Methylation of EPB41L3 (1-6 CpG-sites), hTERT (1-10 CpG-sites) and FAM19A4 (1-5 CpG-sites) was assessed through pyrosequencing from 44 HPV+\u00a0samples (4 cancers, 19 HSIL, 4 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 17 normal). New primers were designed for FAM19A4 directed to the first exon region not explored previously. In clinician-collected samples, methylation at CpG-sites 4 and 5 of EPB41L3 were the best HSIL predictors (AUC >0.83) and CpG-site 4 for cancer (0.925). Combination of EPB41L3 sites 2/4 plus FAM19A4 site 1 were the best HSIL+\u00a0markers [100% sensitivity, 63.2% specificity]. Methylation at CpG-site 5 of FAM19A4 was the best HSIL predictor (0.67) in self-collected samples, and CpG-sites 1 and 3 of FAM19A4 for cancer (0.77). Combined, FAM19A4 site 1 plus HPV 16/18 detection yielded sensitivity of 82.6% and specificity of 61.9%. In conclusion, methylation at individual CpG-sites of EPB41L3 and FAM19A4 outperformed global analysis and improved HSIL+\u00a0detection, warranting further investigation.",

With the abundance of novel therapies, NI trials are increasing in publication. Prior studies found inadequate quality of reporting of NI studies, but were limited to certain specialties/journals, lacked NI margin evaluation, and did not examine temporal changes in quality. We conducted a systematic review without restriction to journal type, journal impact factor, disease state or intervention to evaluate the quality of NI trials, including a comprehensive risk of bias assessment and comparison of quality over time.",

Genistein is a natural isoflavonoid with known chemotherapeutic activity. Unfortunately, it has low bioavailability due to its poor aqueous solubility and excessive metabolism. In the current study, genistein was incorporated into transferosomal hydrogel to improve its bioavailability. The prepared transferosomal formulations were characterized regarding: particle size; polydispersity index; zeta potential; encapsulation efficiency; TEM; FTIR; DSC; XRD; ",

Botanical extracts, rich in phytoconstituents, present a useful resource for discovering therapies that could target senescence and thus improve healthspan. Here, we show that daily oral administration of a standardized extract of Salvia haenkei (Haenkenium (HK)) extended lifespan and healthspan of naturally aged mice. HK treatment inhibited age-induced inflammation, fibrosis and senescence markers across several tissues, as well as increased muscle strength and fur thickness compared with age-matched controls. We also found that HK treatment reduced acutely induced senescence by the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, using p16",

        "Abstract": "Intrinsic breast cancer molecular subtyping (IBCMS) provides significant prognostic information for patients with breast cancer and helps determine treatment. This study compared IBCMS methods on various gene-expression platforms in PALOMA-2 and PALLET trials. PALOMA-2 tumor samples were profiled using EdgeSeq and nanostring and subtyped with AIMS, PAM50, and research-use-only (ruo)Prosigna. PALLET tumor biopsies were profiled using mRNA sequencing and subtyped with AIMS and PAM50. In PALOMA-2 (n\u2009=\u2009222), a 54% agreement was observed between results from AIMS and gold-standard ruoProsigna, with AIMS assigning 67% basal-like to HER2-enriched. In PALLET (n\u2009=\u2009224), a 69% agreement was observed between results from PAM50 and AIMS. Different IBCMS methods may lead to different results and could misguide treatment selection; hence, a standardized clinical PAM50 assay and computational approach should be used.Trial number: NCT01740427.",

        "Abstract": "The issue of obstetric violence is internationally acknowledged as a serious violation of human rights. First identified by the Committee of Experts of the Inter-American Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1 Convention in 2012, it is recognized as a form of gender-based violence that infringes upon women's rights during childbirth. Nations such as Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, and certain regions in Spain have implemented laws against it, highlighting its severity and the need for protective legislation. Major international organizations, including WHO and the Council of Europe, advocate for the elimination of disrespectful and abusive treatment in maternity care. In 2019, the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women called on states to protect women's human rights in reproductive services by enforcing laws, prosecuting perpetrators, and providing compensation to victims. However, despite advances, there remains institutional and systemic resistance to recognizing obstetric violence, which undermines trust in healthcare and impacts women's quality of life. Addressing this violence is imperative, requiring education and training in women's human rights for all healthcare professionals. As part of the coalition of experts from various organizations (InterOVO), we respond to the publication by EAPM, EBCOG, and EMA: \"Joint Position Statement: Substandard and Disrespectful Care in Labor - Because Words Matter.\" We are committed to preventing and mitigating obstetric violence and improving care for women and newborns.",

        "Abstract": "The approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), introducing several ICI-based combinations as the new standard of care for affected patients. Nonetheless, monotherapy with antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as pazopanib or sunitinib, still represents a first-line treatment option for selected patients belonging to the favorable risk group according to the International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) model. After TKI monotherapy, the main second-line option is represented by ICI monotherapy with the anti-Programmed Death Receptor 1(PD-1) nivolumab. To date, the expected clinical outcomes are similar with pazopanib or sunitinib and there is no clear indication for selecting one TKI over the other. Moreover, their impact on subsequent ICI treatment outcomes is not well defined, yet. Based on these premises, we investigated the immunomodulatory activity of these drugs in vitro and in vivo.Both TKIs induced Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and soluble PD-L1 release in RCC cells, and hampered T cell activation, reducing cytokine production and the proportion of activated T cells. Nevertheless, in a syngeneic co-culture system with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumor cells, incubation with anti-PD-1 antibody following TKIs treatment significantly restored T cell function, potentiating the cytotoxic effects against tumor cells. Pazopanib and sunitinib followed by anti-PD-1 antibody produced a comparable inhibition of tumor growth in a RCC syngeneic mouse model. Our findings suggest that pazopanib and sunitinib, showing similar immunomodulatory effects, may have a comparable impact on the subsequent effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.",

        "Abstract": "In the context of deep learning models, attention has recently been paid to studying the surface of the loss function in order to better understand training with methods based on gradient descent. This search for an appropriate description, both analytical and topological, has led to numerous efforts in identifying spurious minima and characterize gradient dynamics. Our work aims to contribute to this field by providing a topological measure for evaluating loss complexity in the case of multilayer neural networks. We compare deep and shallow architectures with common sigmoidal activation functions by deriving upper and lower bounds for the complexity of their respective loss functions and revealing how that complexity is influenced by the number of hidden units, training models, and the activation function used. Additionally, we found that certain variations in the loss function or model architecture, such as adding an \u2113",

This way, this work reports an integrative review with a current analytical approach for food authentication, indicating the main analytical techniques to identify adulteration and perform the traceability of chemical components in processed and non-processed foods, evaluating the authenticity and geographic origin. This work presents results from a systematic search in Science Direct\u00ae and Scopus\u00ae databases using the keywords \"authentication\" AND \"food\", \"authentication,\" AND \"beverage\", from published papers from 2013 to, 2024. All research and reviews published were employed in the bibliometric analysis, evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of analytical techniques, indicating the perspectives for direct, quick, and simple analysis, guaranteeing the application of quality standards, and ensuring food safety for consumers. Furthermore, this work reports the analysis of natural foods to evaluate the origin (traceability), and industrialized foods to detect adulterations and fraud. A focus on research to detect adulteration in milk and dairy products is presented due to the importance of these products in the nutrition of the world population. All analytical tools discussed have advantages and drawbacks, including sample preparation steps, the need for reference materials, and mathematical treatments. So, the main advances in modern analytical techniques for the identification and quantification of food adulterations, mainly milk and dairy products, were discussed, indicating trends and perspectives on food authentication.",

        "Abstract": "Aurones, particular polyphenolic compounds belonging to the class of minor flavonoids and overlooked for a long time, have gained significative attention in medicinal chemistry in recent years. Indeed, considering their unique and outstanding biological properties, they stand out as an intriguing reservoir of new potential lead compounds in the drug discovery context. Nevertheless, several physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic (P3) issues hinder their progression in more advanced phases of the drug discovery pipeline, making lead optimization campaigns necessary. In this context, scaffold hopping has proven to be a valuable approach in the optimization of natural products. This review provides a comprehensive and updated picture of the scaffold-hopping approaches directed at the optimization of natural and synthetic aurones. In the literature analysis, a particular focus is given to nitrogen and sulfur analogues. For each class presented, general synthetic procedures are summarized, highlighting the key advantages and potential issues. Furthermore, the biological activities of the most representative scaffold-hopped compounds are presented, emphasizing the improvements achieved and the potential for further optimization compared to the aurone class.",

        "Abstract": "Current United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations include routine screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer; however, two out of every three cancer cases occur in other indications, leading to diagnoses in advanced stages of the disease and a higher likelihood of mortality. Blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests can impact cancer screening and early detection by monitoring for multiple different cancer types at once, including indications where screening is not performed routinely today. We conducted a survey amongst healthcare providers (HCPs), payers, and patients within the U.S. health system to understand the current utilization of cancer screening tests and the anticipated barriers to widespread adoption of blood-based MCED tests. The results indicated that the community favors the adoption of blood-based MCED tests and that there is broad agreement on the value proposition. Despite this recognition, the survey highlighted that there is limited use today due to the perceived lack of clinical accuracy and utility data, high out-of-pocket patient costs, and lack of payer coverage. To overcome the hurdles for future widespread adoption of blood-based MCED tests, increased investment in data generation, education, and implementation of logistical support for HCPs will be critical.",

        "Abstract": "A \"Think Tank for Osteosarcoma\" medical advisory board meeting was held in Santa Monica, CA, USA on February 2-3, 2024. The goal was to develop a strategic approach to prevent recurrence of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma metabolism and the genomic instability of osteosarcoma, immunotherapy for osteosarcoma, CAR-T cell therapy, DeltaRex-G tumor-targeted gene therapy, repurposed drugs, alternative medicines, and personalized medicine were discussed. Only DeltaRex-G was voted on. The conclusions were the following: No intervention has been demonstrated to improve survival in a clinical trial. Additionally, the consensus (10/12 in favor) was that DeltaRex-G without immunotherapy may be administered for up to one year. Phase 2/3 randomized studies of DeltaRex-G should be performed to determine whether the incidence of recurrence could be reduced in high-risk individuals. Furthermore, a personalized approach using drugs with minimal toxicity could be attempted with the acknowledgement that there are no efficacy data to base this on. Repurposed drugs and alternative therapies should be tested in mouse models of osteosarcoma. Moreover, unmodified IL-2 primed Gamma Delta (NK) cell therapy may be used to prevent recurrence. Lastly, rapid development of CAR-T cell therapy is recommended, and an institute dedicated to the study of osteosarcoma is needed.",

To explore the service needs of this population, we interviewed providers (n = 11) and clients (n = 10) from eight supportive housing organizations working with SGM populations in Los Angeles County, USA. We used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to synthesize interview responses into themes (by domain and cross-cutting). Take-aways included the need for investment in systems of care for vulnerable SGM populations; the particular marginalization of Trans individuals and providers that serve them; the roles of supportive housing staff, residents, and leadership in cultivating an affirming environment; prevalence of discrimination and stigma within supportive housing programs and broader society; and the complex interrelationships among SGM identity, homelessness, and criminal justice system involvement. These findings have important implications for supportive housing services and related policy.",

        "Abstract": "Insurer-provider integration is a new form of vertical integration, with increasing prominence in health care markets. While there are potential benefits from tighter alignment between providers and payers, risks of perverse impacts on health care markets loom large. Yet, little is known about this new wave of consolidation, which limits options for policy or regulatory responses. We focus on a dominant insurer's acquisitions of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) to document the growth and geographic spread of these ownership events. We found that a diverse swathe of the United States has experienced an insurer-led ASC takeover. The acquisitions are also more frequently in areas where the insurer holds a higher enrollee market share at baseline, although a linear prediction of the likelihood of ASC acquisition shows a more nuanced picture.",

        "Title": "A randomized trial of collaborative support for opioid taper after trauma hospitalization.",
        "Abstract": "The COTAT (Collaborative Opioid Taper After Trauma) Study was a randomized trial of an opioid taper support program using a physician assistant (PA) to provide pain and opioid treatment guidance to primary care providers assuming care for adult patients with moderate to severe trauma discharged from a Level I trauma center on opioid therapy. Patients were recruited, assessed, and randomized individually by a surgery research recruitment team one to two days prior to discharge to home. Participants randomized to the opioid taper support program were contacted by phone within a few days of discharge by the PA interventionist to confirm enrollment and their primary care provider (PCP). The intervention consisted of PA support as needed to the PCP concerning pain and opioid care at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 after discharge or until the PCP office indicated they no longer needed support or the patient had tapered off opioids. The PA was supervised by a pain physician-psychiatrist, a family physician, and a trauma surgeon. Patients randomized to usual care received standard hospital discharge instructions and written information on managing opioid medications after discharge. Trial results were analyzed using repeated measures analysis. 37 participants were randomized to the intervention and 36 were randomized to usual care. The primary outcomes of the trial were pain, enjoyment, general activity (PEG score) and mean daily opioid dose at 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge. Treatment was unblinded but assessment was blinded. No significant differences in PEG or opioid outcomes were noted at either time point. Physical function at 3 and 6 months and pain interference at 6 months were significantly better in the usual care group. No significant harms of the intervention were noted. COVID-19 (corona virus 2019) limited recruitment of high-risk opioid tolerant subjects, and limited contact between the PA interventionist and the participants and the PCPs. Our opioid taper support program failed to improve opioid and pain outcomes, since both control and intervention groups tapered opioids and improved PEG scores after discharge. Future trials of post-trauma opioid taper support with populations at higher risk of persistent opioid use are needed. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under NCT04275258 19/02/2020. This trial was funded by a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the University of Washington Harborview Injury Prevention & Research Center (R49 CE003087, PI: Monica S. Vavilala, MD). The funder had no role in the analysis or interpretation of the data.",

        "Abstract": "Biopolymers like starch, a renewable and widely available resource, are increasingly being used to fabricate the films for eco-friendly packaging solutions. Starch-based edible films offer significant advantages for food packaging, including biodegradability and the ability to extend shelf life. However, they also present challenges such as moisture sensitivity and limited barrier properties compared to synthetic materials. These limitations can be mitigated by incorporating bioactive components, such as antimicrobial agents or antioxidants, which enhance the film's resistance to moisture and improve its barrier properties, making it a more viable option for food packaging. This review explores the emerging field of starch-based sustainable edible films enhanced with bioactive components for food packaging applications. It delves into fabrication techniques, structural properties, and functional attributes, highlighting the potential of these innovative films to reduce environmental impact and preserve food quality. Key topics discussed include sustainability issues, processing methods, performance characteristics, and potential applications in the food industry. The review provides a comprehensive overview of current research and developments in starch-based edible films, presenting them as promising alternatives to conventional food packaging that can help reduce plastic waste and environmental impact.",

        "Abstract": "Our previous study identified 8 risk and 9 protective plasma miRNAs associated with progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in diabetes. This study aimed to elucidate preanalytical factors that influence the quantification of circulating miRNAs. Using the EdgeSeq platform, which quantifies 2,002 miRNAs in plasma, including ESKD-associated miRNAs, we compared miRNA profiles in whole plasma versus miRNA profiles in RNA extracted from the same plasma specimens. Less than half of the miRNAs were detected in standard RNA extraction from plasma. Detection of individual and concentrations of miRNAs were much lower when RNA extracted from plasma was quantified by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) or quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) platforms compared with EdgeSeq. Plasma profiles of miRNAs determined by the EdgeSeq platform had excellent reproducibility in assessment and had no variation with age, sex, hemoglobin A1c, BMI, and cryostorage time. The risk ESKD-associated miRNAs were detected and measured accurately only in whole plasma and using the EdgeSeq platform. Protective ESKD-associated miRNAs were detected by all platforms except qRT-PCR; however, correlations among concentrations obtained with different platforms were weak or nonexistent. In conclusion, preanalytical factors have a profound effect on detection and quantification of circulating miRNAs in ESKD in diabetes. Quantification of miRNAs in whole plasma and using the EdgeSeq platform may be the preferable method to study profiles of circulating cell-free miRNAs associated with ESKD and possibly other diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Public health policy interventions are associated with many important public health achievements. To provide public health practitioners and decision makers with practical approaches for examining and employing evidence-based public health (EBPH) policy interventions, we describe the characteristics and benefits that distinguish EBPH policy interventions from programmatic interventions. These characteristics include focusing on health at a population level, focusing on upstream drivers of health, and involving less individual action than programmatic interventions. The benefits of EBPH policy interventions include more sustained effects on health than many programs and an enhanced ability to address health inequities. Early childhood education and universal preschool provide a case example that illustrates the distinction between EBPH policy and programmatic interventions. This review serves as the foundation for 3 concepts that support the effective use of public health policy interventions: applying core component thinking to understand the population health effects of EBPH policy interventions; understanding the influence of existing policies, policy supports, and the context in which a particular policy is implemented on the effectiveness of that policy; and employing a systems thinking approach to identify leverage points where policy implementation can have a meaningful effect.",

        "Abstract": "Polysaccharide-based nanogels offer a wide range of chemical compositions and are of great interest due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and their ability to display pH, temperature, or enzymatic response. In this work, we synthesized monodisperse and tunable pH-sensitive nanogels by crosslinking, through reductive amination, chitosan and partially oxidized maltodextrins, by keeping the concentration of chitosan close to its overlap concentration, i.e. in the dilute and semi-dilute regime. The chitosan/maltodextrin nanogels presented sizes ranging from 63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 to 279\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016\u00a0nm, showed quasi-spherical and cauliflower-like morphology, reached a \u03b6-potential of +36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mV and maintained a colloidal stability for up to 7\u00a0weeks. It was found that the size and surface charge of nanogels depended both on the oxidation degree of maltodextrins and chitosan concentration, as well as on its degree of acetylation and protonation, the latter tuned by pH. The pH-responsiveness of the nanogels was evidenced by an increased size, owed to swelling, and \u03b6-potential when pH was lowered. Finally, maltodextrin-chitosan biocompatible nanogels were assessed by cell viability assay performed using the HEK293T cell line.",

        "Abstract": "We develop a simulation framework for studying misinformation spread within online social networks that blends agent-based modeling and natural language processing techniques. While many other agent-based simulations exist in this space, questions over their fidelity and generalization to existing networks in part hinder their ability to drive policy-relevant decision making. To partially address these concerns, we create a 'digital clone' of a known misinformation sharing network by downloading social media histories for over ten thousand of its users. We parse these histories to both extract the structure of the network and model the nuanced ways in which information is shared and spread among its members. Unlike many other agent-based methods in this space, information sharing between users in our framework is sensitive to topic of discussion, user preferences, and online community dynamics. To evaluate the fidelity of our method, we seed our cloned network with a set of posts recorded in the base network and compare propagation dynamics between the two, observing reasonable agreement across the twin networks over a variety of metrics. Lastly, we explore how the cloned network may serve as a flexible, low-cost testbed for misinformation countermeasure evaluation and red teaming analysis. We hope the tools explored here augment existing efforts in the space and unlock new opportunities for misinformation countermeasure evaluation, a field that may become increasingly important to consider with the anticipated rise of misinformation campaigns fueled by generative artificial intelligence.",

        "Abstract": "Discoveries in the field of genomics have revealed that non-coding genomic regions are not merely \"junk DNA\", but rather comprise critical elements involved in gene expression. These gene regulatory elements (GREs) include enhancers, insulators, silencers, and gene promoters. Notably, new evidence shows how mutations within these regions substantially influence gene expression programs, especially in the context of cancer. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have accelerated the identification of somatic and germline single nucleotide mutations in non-coding genomic regions. This review provides an overview of somatic and germline non-coding single nucleotide alterations affecting transcription factor binding sites in GREs, specifically involved in cancer biology. It also summarizes the technologies available for exploring GREs and the challenges associated with studying and characterizing non-coding single nucleotide mutations. Understanding the role of GRE alterations in cancer is essential for improving diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in the precision medicine era, leading to enhanced patient-centered clinical outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Treatment of children with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) having a hypoplastic mandible and upper airway distress after birth may consist of external distraction devices. Shape anomalies of the permanent molars and positional changes due to surgery have been documented. The aim of this study is to compare the long-term effects (>5 years) on the growth pattern of PRS-patients treated with an external mandibular distraction device with no-surgery cases and to investigate the dental development or damage. A retrospective cohort study was performed. PRS-patients with and without surgery were included. A digital cephalometric analysis was made to evaluate the growth pattern of the mandible between groups as well as with normal values. Nine of 19 patients underwent an external mandibular distraction. All children were extubated after 4-5 days with no signs of respiratory distress. Screw and device loosening presented in one patient. The articular and sellar angles were significantly larger and smaller, respectively, in the Surgery group. Mandibular distraction surgery might result in a 'growth boost' compared to the No-surgery group. No significant difference in dental development was found. Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is an effective way of relieving severe upper airway obstruction.",

        "Title": "Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparisons of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel to Mosunetuzumab for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Follicular Lymphoma.",
        "Abstract": "Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) was the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy approved for relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) patients, while mosunetuzumab was the first bispecific monoclonal antibody approved in this population. In the absence of head-to-head evidence, this study sought to conduct a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to estimate the comparative efficacy and safety of these treatments in 3rd line or higher (3L+) FL. The evidence base consisted of individual patient data (IPD) of all enrolled patients, regardless of infusion status, from the single-arm axi-cel trial, ZUMA-5 (NCT03105336), and aggregate data from the mosunetuzumab FL trial (NCT02500407) from publications identified through a systematic review. Efficacy outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), objective response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR). Analyses used independent central review for both trials, where possible. Safety outcomes were cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurological events (NE), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Unanchored MAICs were conducted to align ZUMA-5 to the patient characteristics of the mosunetuzumab trial. For each outcome, prognostic factors were identified a priori through quantitative analysis and clinical experts. For time-to-event outcomes, hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox regression using IPD from ZUMA-5 and pseudo-IPD extracted from Kaplan-Meier plots for mosunetuzumab. Patient characteristics were well-aligned between trials leading to large effective-sample sizes after matching, ranging from 93.4 to 115.5, for ZUMA-5 (n = 127). In comparisons to mosunetuzumab (n = 90), axi-cel was associated with improved PFS (HR: 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24-0.62) and DoR (HR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.27-0.76). Similarly, axi-cel led to higher ORR (OR: 3.87; 95% CI: 1.53-9.76) and CRR (OR: 2.80; 95% CI: 1.50-5.26). Although axi-cel was associated with a higher rate of all-grade CRS (OR: 5.54; 95% CI: 2.63-8.94) and NEs (OR: 3.54; 95% CI: 1.28-9.83), differences in grade \u22653 CRS and TRAEs were not statistically significant. Findings from this study show improved efficacy and more durable response for the treatment of 3L+ R/R FL with axi-cel relative to mosunetuzumab, with increased odds of all-grade CRS and NE, but not G3+ CRS and TRAEs.",

        "Abstract": "Peer advocacy can promote HIV protective behaviors, but little is known about the concordance on prevention advocacy(PA) reports between people living with HIV(PLWH) and their social network members. We examined prevalence and correlates of such concordance, and its association with the targeted HIV protective behavior of the social network member. Data were analyzed from 193 PLWH(index participants) and their 599 social network members(alters). Kappa statistics measured concordance between index and alter reports of PA in the past 3 months. Logistic and multinomial regressions evaluated the relationship between advocacy concordance and alter condom use and HIV testing behavior and correlates of PA concordance. Advocacy concordance was observed in 0.3% of index-alter dyads for PrEP discussion, 9% for condom use, 18% for HIV testing, 26% for care engagement, and 49% for antiretroviral use discussions. Fewer indexes reported condom use(23.5% vs. 28.1%;[Formula: see text]=3.7, p=0.05) and HIV testing(30.5% vs. 50.5%; [Formula: see text]=25.3, p<0.001) PA occurring. Condom advocacy concordance was higher if the index and alter were romantic partners(OR=3.50; p=0.02), and lower if the index was 10 years younger than the alter(OR=0.23; p\u2009=\u20090.02). Alters had higher odds of using condoms with their main partner when both reported condom advocacy compared to dyads where neither reported advocacy(OR=3.90; p<0.001) and compared to dyads where only the index reported such advocacy(OR\u2009=\u20093.71; p=0.01). Age difference and relationship status impact advocacy agreement, and concordant perceptions of advocacy are linked to increased HIV protective behaviors. Alters' perceptions may be crucial for behavior change, informing strategies for improving advocacy.",

        "Abstract": "Treatment with atezolizumab and bevacizumab has become standard of care for advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but carries an increased gastrointestinal bleeding risk. Therefore, patients are often required to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to rule out esophageal varices (EV) prior to initiating therapy, which can delay care and lead to unnecessary procedural risks and health care costs. In 2019, the EVendo score was created and validated as a noninvasive tool to accurately screen out patients who were at low risk for having EV that required treatment. We sought to validate whether the EVendo score could be used to accurately predict the presence of EV and varices needing treatment (VNT) in patients with HCC.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate estimation of the dispersal velocity or speed of evolving organisms is no mean feat. In fact, existing probabilistic models in phylogeography or spatial population genetics generally do not provide an adequate framework to define velocity in a relevant manner. For instance, the very concept of instantaneous speed simply does not exist under one of the most popular approaches that models the evolution of spatial coordinates as Brownian trajectories running along a phylogeny [30]. Here, we introduce a new family of models - the so-called \"Phylogenetic Integrated Velocity\" (PIV) models - that use Gaussian processes to explicitly model the velocity of evolving lineages instead of focusing on the fluctuation of spatial coordinates over time. We describe the properties of these models and show an increased accuracy of velocity estimates compared to previous approaches. Analyses of West Nile virus data in the U.S.A. indicate that PIV models provide sensible predictions of the dispersal of evolving pathogens at a one-year time horizon. These results demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of predictive phylogeography in monitoring epidemics in time and space.",

        "Abstract": "Talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) is a genetically modified oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) that is used for the intralesional treatment of advanced or metastatic melanoma. Given that TVEC produces the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), recent reports have suggested that radiation treatment (RT) given in conjunction with TVEC may provide synergistic immune activation at the site, and possibly systemically. However, studies on combining RT with TVEC remain limited. We conducted a retrospective review of melanoma patients from a single cancer center who received TVEC and RT in the same region of the body and compared them to patients who received TVEC with RT at another site (other than the site of TVEC injection). Between January 2015 and September 2022, we identified twenty patients who were treated with TVEC and RT; fourteen patients received TVEC and RT in the same region, and six had treatments in separate regions. Regions were determined at the time of analysis and were based on anatomic sites (such as arm, leg, torso, etc.). Kaplan-Meier analysis of progression-free survival (PFS), analyses of time to distant metastasis (DM), overall survival (OS), and locoregional control (LRC), and the corresponding log-rank test were performed. With a median follow-up of 10.5 months [mos] (range 1.0-58.7 mos), we found an improvement in PFS with TVEC and RT in the same region compared to different regions, which were 6.4 mos (95% CI, 2.4-NR mos) and 2.8 mos (95% CI, 0.7-4.4 mos), respectively; ",

        "Abstract": "The transition from paediatric to adult care poses a significant health system-level challenge impeding the delivery of quality health services for youth with chronic health conditions. In Canada and globally, the transition to adult care is regarded as a top priority in adolescent health in need of readily applicable, adaptable, and relevant national metrics to evaluate and benchmark transition success across disease populations and clinical care settings. Unfortunately, existing literature fails to account for the lack of engagement from youth and caregivers in developing indicators, and its applicability across chronic conditions, primary care involvement, and health equity considerations.",

        "Title": "Families as partners in neonatal neuro-critical care programs.",
        "Abstract": "Parents of neonates with neurologic conditions face a specific breadth of emotional, logistical, and social challenges, including difficulties coping with prognostic uncertainty, the need to make complex medical decisions, and navigating new hopes and fears. These challenges place parents in a vulnerable position and at risk of developing mental health issues, which can interfere with bonding and caring for their neonate, as well as compromise their neonate's long-term neurodevelopment. To optimize neurologic and developmental outcomes, emerging neonatal neuro-critical care (NNCC) programs must concurrently attend to the unique needs of the developing newborn brain and of his/her parents. This can only be accomplished by embracing a family-centered care environment-one which prioritizes effective parent-clinician communication, longitudinal parent support, and parents as equitable partners in clinical care. NNCC programs offer a multifaceted approach to critical care for neonates at-risk for neurodevelopmental impairments, integrating expertise in neonatology and neurology. This review highlights evidence-based strategies to guide NNCC programs in developing a family-partnered approach to care, including primary staffing models; staff communication, implicit bias, and cultural competency trainings; comprehensive and tailored caregiver training; single-family rooms; flexible visitation policies; colocalized neonatal and maternal care; uniform mental health screenings; follow-up care referrals; and connections to peer support. IMPACT: Parents of neonates with neurologic conditions are at high-risk for experiencing mental health issues, which can adversely impact the parent-neonate relationship and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of their neonates. While guidelines to promote families as partners in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have been developed, no protocols integrate the unique needs of parents in neonatal neurologic populations. A holistic approach that makes families true partners in the care of their neonate with a neurologic condition in the NICU has the potential to improve mental and physical well-being for both parents and neonates.",

        "Abstract": "The Prescribing Information (PI) in the United States (US) and the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) in the European Union (EU) are approved by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), respectively. The inclusion of overdosage information in these documents is a regulatory requirement in both regions. This research evaluates the content of the overdosage section of US and EU labeling. The overdosage sections of labels for drugs approved in the US in three time periods were analyzed: 2000-2001, 2010-2011, and 2020-2021. EU labels for these same products were also reviewed if registered through the Centralized Procedure. Data collection and analyses were performed using a predefined questionnaire, focusing on adherence to regulatory requirements and identifying areas where additional regulatory guidance may be beneficial. The findings indicate that the content of the overdosage sections largely comply with the regulatory requirements of their respective regions. Fewer than half of the labels included information on supratherapeutic doses observed from clinical studies, risk factors for overdose or population specific data associated with overdose. Inconsistencies were noted concerning the incorporation of animal data when human data were available, in addition to the referencing of Poison Centers. The overall utility of non-specific treatment recommendations, in addition to gastric lavage is discussed. While the content of the overdosage section generally aligns with regulatory expectations, additional regulatory guidance could enhance consistency in how this section of labeling is presented and clarify expectations to improve its usefulness for health care professionals (HCPs).",

        "Abstract": "Immunocompromised individuals are at significantly elevated risk for severe courses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition to vaccination,\u00a0severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have been applied throughout the pandemic, with time of treatment onset and potency against the currently prevailing virus variant identified as relevant factors for medical benefit. Using data from the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) registry, the present study evaluated COVID-19 cases in three groups of patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI; 981 agammaglobulinemia patients on immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT); 8960 non-agammaglobulinemia patients on IGRT; 14\u2009428 patients without IGRT), and the neutralizing capacity of 1100 immunoglobulin lots against SARS-CoV-2 (\"Wuhan\" and Omicron strains), throughout 3 years. From the first (2020/2021) to the second (2021/2022) cold season, i.e., during the virus drift to the more contagious Omicron variants, an increase in case numbers was recorded that was comparable (~2- to 3-fold) for all three study groups. During the same period, immunoglobulin lots showed a profound nAb increase against the archetypal SARS-CoV-2 strain, yet only low levels of Omicron nAbs. Notably, shortly before the third (2022/2023) cold season, Omicron-neutralizing capacity of released immunoglobulin lots had plateaued at high levels. From the second to the third cold season, COVID-19 cases dropped markedly. While a ~6-fold case reduction was recorded for the groups of non-agammaglobulinemia patients on IGRT and IEI patients not receiving IGRT, the decline was ~30-fold for the group of agammaglobulinemia patients on IGRT. These findings suggest a substantial COVID-19-protective effect of IGRT, at least for distinct groups of antibody-deficient patients.",

        "Abstract": "The family Acuariidae is a speciose group of parasitic nematodes, infecting mostly birds as definitive hosts. This study focused on the characterization of two species of acuariids, collected in two different species of piscivorous birds, the European great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis from Italy, and the pygmy cormorant Microcarbo pygmaeus from Israel. Parasites were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy and by amplification and sequencing of the 28S rDNA. The results of morphological and molecular analyses showed that Ph. carbo sinensis was infected by the acuariid Syncuaria squamata (12 females) and Cosmocephalus obvelatus (1 female), whereas M. pygmaeus was infected by C. obvelatus (2 males, 12 females). The present results provide new data on the distribution of acuariid parasites of piscivorous birds, the first report of Acuariidae in Israel, and the first molecular data on S. squamata and C. obvelatus, which will be useful in future epidemiological and phylogenetic studies of these widely distributed, but less molecularly studied parasites.",

        "Abstract": "Microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer (MSS mCRC; mismatch repair proficient) has previously responded poorly to immune checkpoint blockade. Botensilimab (BOT) is an Fc-enhanced multifunctional anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody designed to expand therapy to cold/poorly immunogenic solid tumors, such as MSS mCRC. BOT with or without balstilimab (BAL; anti-PD-1 antibody) is being evaluated in an ongoing expanded phase 1 study. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability, which was evaluated separately in the dose-escalation portion of the study and in patients with MSS mCRC (using combined dose-escalation/dose-expansion data). Secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed RECIST version 1.1-confirmed objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Here we present outcomes in 148 heavily pre-treated patients with MSS mCRC (six from the dose-escalation cohort; 142 from the dose-expansion cohort) treated with BOT and BAL, 101 of whom were considered response evaluable with at least 6\u2009months of follow-up. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 89% of patients with MSS mCRC (131/148), most commonly fatigue (35%, 52/148), diarrhea (32%, 47/148) and pyrexia (24%, 36/148), with no grade 5 TRAEs reported and a 12% discontinuation rate due to a TRAE (18/148; data fully mature). In the response-evaluable population (n\u2009=\u2009101), ORR was 17% (17/101; 95% confidence interval (CI), 10-26%), and DCR was 61% (62/101; 95% CI, 51-71%). Median DOR was not reached (NR; 95% CI, 5.7\u2009months-NR), and median PFS was 3.5\u2009months (95% CI, 2.7-4.1\u2009months), at a median follow-up of 10.3\u2009months (range, 0.5-42.6\u2009months; data continuing to mature). The combination of BOT plus BAL demonstrated a manageable safety profile with no new immune-mediated safety signals and encouraging clinical activity with durable responses.

        "Abstract": "Immigration-related problems and stressors are prevalent and pressing concerns among Latinx and Asian American school-age youth. Youth fears related to family deportation have been associated with adverse mental health outcomes. This study used an ecological framework to examine the impact of immigration stress and school- and community-level resources and protective factors on Latinx and Asian American youth internalizing symptoms. The sample included 1309 Asian American and 701 Latinx students (N\u00a0=\u00a02010) who participated in a routine school-based mental health needs assessment survey. Multilevel regressions analyses revealed that first-generation youth, Latinx youth, and female youth were more vulnerable to experiencing immigration-related problems and worry. Student perceptions of negative school climate and community violence were associated with greater internalizing symptoms regardless of immigration worry. Moderation analyses revealed that immigration-related problems and worry were positively associated with internalizing symptoms and that this relationship did not differ by race/ethnicity. However, immigration worry was a particular risk factor for students who perceived their neighborhood community as safe. Findings highlight that a sociopolitical climate that sows immigration-related challenges fuels youth distress and that students' experiences of their community environment can play an essential role as a psychological resource.",

        "Abstract": "The flavonoid family is a set of well-known bioactive natural molecules, with a wide range of potential therapeutic applications. Despite the promising results obtained in preliminary in vitro/vivo studies, their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are severely compromised by chemical instability. To address this issue, the scaffold-hopping approach is a promising strategy for the structural optimization of natural leads to discover more potent analogues. In this scenario, this Perspective provides a critical analysis on how the replacement of the chromon-4-one flavonoid core with other bioisosteric nitrogen/sulphur heterocycles might affect the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological properties of the resulting new chemical entities. The investigated derivatives were classified on the basis of their biological activity and potential therapeutic indications. For each session, the target(s), the specific mechanism of action, if available, and the key pharmacophoric moieties were highlighted, as revealed by X-ray crystal structures and in silico structure-based studies. Biological activity data, in vitro/vivo studies, were examined: a particular focus was given on the improvements observed with the new heterocyclic analogues compared to the natural flavonoids. This overview of the scaffold-hopping advantages in flavonoid compounds is of great interest to the medicinal chemistry community to better exploit the vast potential of these natural molecules and to identify new bioactive molecules.",

        "Abstract": "Sexual minority men (gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men; SMM) in Nigeria are disproportionately affected by HIV compared to heterosexual men. There is a dearth of research on the correlates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) non-adherence and correlates in both groups. The current study examined the associations of ART non-adherence with sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics among a sample of Nigerian heterosexual and SMM. Between March and September 2014, we surveyed 120 SMM and 108 heterosexual men receiving ART in Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria. We specified univariate and multivariable linear regression models to examine correlates of ART non-adherence. We found that 50.8% and 29.6% of sexual minority and heterosexual men respectively self-reported ART non-adherence which was significantly associated with psychosocial factors such as stigma, depressive symptoms, and suicidality. Mental health care and psychosocial support should be incorporated into routine HIV care for Nigerian SMM living with HIV.",

        "Title": "Ecological \"Windows of opportunity\" influence biofilm prokaryotic diversity differently in glacial and non-glacial Alpine streams.",
        "Abstract": "In glacier-fed streams, the Windows of Opportunity (WOs) are periods of mild environmental conditions supporting the seasonal development of benthic microorganisms. WOs have been defined based on changes in biofilm biomass, but the responses of microbial diversity to WOs in Alpine streams have been overlooked. A two year (2017-2018) metabarcoding of epilithic and epipsammic biofilm prokaryotes was conducted in Alpine streams fed by glaciers (kryal), rock glaciers (rock glacial), or groundwater/precipitation (krenal) in two catchments of the Central-Eastern European Alps (Italy), aiming at testing the hypothesis that: 1) environmental WOs enhance not only the biomass but also the \u03b1-diversity of the prokaryotic biofilm in all stream types, 2) diversity and phenology of prokaryotic biofilm are mainly influenced by the physical habitat in glacial streams, and by water chemistry in the other two stream types. The study confirmed kryal and krenal streams as endmembers of epilithic and sediment prokaryotic \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity, with rock glacial streams sharing a large proportion of taxa with the two other stream types. Alpha-diversity appeared to respond to ecological WOs, but, contrary to expectations, seasonality was less pronounced in the turbid kryal than in the clear streams. This was attributed to the small size of the glaciers feeding the studied kryal streams, whose discharge dynamics were those typical of the late phase of deglaciation. Prokaryotic \u03b1-diversity of non-glacial streams tended to be higher in early summer than in early autumn. Our findings, while confirming that high altitude streams are heavily threatened by climate change, underscore the still neglected role of rock glacier runoffs as climate refugia for the most stenothermic benthic aquatic microorganism. This advocates the need to define and test strategies for protecting these ecosystems for preserving, restoring, and connecting cold Alpine aquatic biodiversity in the context of the progressing global warming.",

        "Title": "Does type of antiretroviral therapy pick-up point influence 12-month virologic suppression in South Africa?",
        "Abstract": "We assessed the impact of community- versus clinic-based medication pick-up on rates of virologic suppression in an observational cohort of adults on ART enrolled in a decentralized antiretroviral therapy program (CCMDD) in South Africa. Participants either attended clinics where they were given the choice to pick up ART in community venues or traditional clinics, or clinics where this pathway was assigned. Among 1856 participants, 977 (53%) opted for community ART pick-up at enrollment, and 1201 (86%) were virologically suppressed at one year. Because of missing data on virologic suppression, primary results are based on a model incorporating multiple imputation. In addition to age and gender, distance from clinic and year of HIV diagnosis were included in the multivariable model. There was no difference in opting for clinic- vs. community-based pick-up with regard to achieving 12-month virologic suppression (aRR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98-1.05) in clinics offering choice. There was no impact of assigning all participants to an external pick-up point (aRR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.06), but virologic suppression was reduced in the clinic that assigned participants to clinic pick-up (aRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.92). These results suggest that provision of community-based ART has not reduced continued virologic suppression in the population enrolled in the CCMDD program.",

Traditionally, the Brand transfer is a favored intervention but requires lengthy grafts and bulky tenorrhaphies, risking adhesions in the lumbrical canal. We present a modified Brand tendon transfer, which extends the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) into 4 tails for individual grafting into the lateral band, decreasing adhesion risk and graft length need.",

The aim of this national survey was to assess how gastroenterologists and general practitioners use rifaximin to manage diverticulosis and diverticular disease.\u00a0Members of the\u00a0Italian Association of Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO) and the Italian Federation of General Practitioners (FIMMG)\u00a0were invited to complete a 39-item online survey concerning the use of rifaximin in five clinical settings: (1) diverticulosis; (2) reducing symptoms in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease;\u00a0(3) reducing the occurrence of diverticulitis in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (primary prevention);\u00a0(4) reducing the recurrence of diverticulitis in patients with previous attacks of diverticulitis (secondary prevention);\u00a0(5) treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.\u00a0A total of 1094 physicians completed the survey. Overall, 25.1%, 83.5%, 68%, 74.2%, and 63% of physicians prescribed rifaximin for the clinical settings 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. In each clinical setting, the dosage of rifaximin most frequently used was 800\u00a0mg/day, the most common duration of therapy was 7\u00a0days, and the cyclic administration of treatment (expressed in months) most frequently used was\u2009>\u200924\u00a0months. These results highlight that a reappraisal of the use of rifaximin in patients with diverticulosis and diverticular disease is required to reduce the gap between the evidence available and the daily clinical practice, optimizing also the use of healthcare resources.",

        "Abstract": "The impact of common and rare variants in COVID-19 host genetics has been widely studied. In particular, in Fallerini et al. (Human genetics, 2022, 141, 147-173), common and rare variants were used to define an interpretable machine learning model for predicting COVID-19 severity. First, variants were converted into sets of Boolean features, depending on the absence or the presence of variants in each gene. An ensemble of LASSO logistic regression models was used to identify the most informative Boolean features with respect to the genetic bases of severity. After that, the Boolean features, selected by these logistic models, were combined into an Integrated PolyGenic Score (IPGS), which offers a very simple description of the contribution of host genetics in COVID-19 severity.. IPGS leads to an accuracy of 55%-60% on different cohorts, and, after a logistic regression with both IPGS and age as inputs, it leads to an accuracy of 75%. The goal of this paper is to improve the previous results, using not only the most informative Boolean features with respect to the genetic bases of severity but also the information on host organs involved in the disease. In this study, we generalize the IPGS adding a statistical weight for each organ, through the transformation of Boolean features into \"Boolean quantum features,\" inspired by quantum mechanics. The organ coefficients were set via the application of the genetic algorithm PyGAD, and, after that, we defined two new integrated polygenic scores (",

        "Abstract": "Persons with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) experience three co-existing stigmatizing health conditions: skin disease, HIV, and cancer, which contribute to a complex experience of stigmatization and to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Despite the importance of stigma among these patients, there are few proven stigma-reduction strategies for HIV-associated malignancies. Using qualitative methods, we explore how people with HIV-associated KS in western Kenya between August 2022 and 2023 describe changes in their stigma experience after participation in a multicomponent navigation strategy, which included 1) physical navigation and care coordination, 2) video-based education with motivational survivor stories, 3) travel stipend, 4) health insurance enrollment assistance, 5) health insurance stipend, and 6) peer mentorship. A purposive sample of persons at different stages of chemotherapy treatment were invited to participate. Participants described how a multicomponent navigation strategy contributed to increased knowledge and awareness, a sense of belonging, hope to survive, encouragement, and social support, which served as stigma mitigators, likely counteracting the major drivers of intersectional stigma in HIV-associated KS.",

Older workers generally face higher job automation risks in part due to their lower levels of digital skills. A better understanding of the associations between job automation risk, digital skills, and type of occupation (e.g., STEM vs non-STEM) can facilitate preparations for job automation and workforce population aging.",

        "Abstract": "Technological advances in radiation therapy impact on the role and scope of practice of the radiation therapist. The European Society of Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) recently held two workshops on this topic and this position paper reflects the outcome of this workshop, which included radiation therapists from all global regions. Workflows, quality assurance, research, IGRT and ART as well as clinical decision making are the areas of radiation therapist practice that will be highly influenced by advancing technology in the near future. This position paper captures the opportunities that this will bring to the radiation therapist profession, to the practice of radiation therapy and ultimately to patient care.",

        "Abstract": "An unmet need exists for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) and high-risk disease features, such as progression of disease within 24\u2009months (POD24) from first-line immunochemotherapy or disease refractory to both CD20-targeting agent and alkylator (double refractory), due to no established standard of care and poor outcomes. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is an option in R/R FL after two or more lines of prior systemic therapy, but there is no consensus on its optimal timing in the disease course of FL, and there are no data in second-line (2L) treatment of patients with high-risk features. Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) is an autologous, CD19-directed, 4-1BB CAR T cell product. The phase 2 TRANSCEND FL study evaluated liso-cel in patients with R/R FL, including 2L patients who all had POD24 from diagnosis after treatment with anti-CD20 antibody and alkylator \u22646\u2009months of FL diagnosis and/or met modified Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires criteria. Primary/key secondary endpoints were independent review committee-assessed overall response rate (ORR)/complete response (CR) rate. At data cutoff, 130 patients had received liso-cel (median follow-up, 18.9\u2009months). Primary/key secondary endpoints were met. In third-line or later FL (n\u2009=\u2009101), ORR was 97% (95% confidence interval (CI): 91.6\u201299.4), and CR rate was 94% (95% CI: 87.5\u201297.8). In 2L FL (n\u2009=\u200923), ORR was 96% (95% CI: 78.1\u201299.9); all responders achieved CR. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 58% of patients (grade \u22653, 1%); neurological events occurred in 15% of patients (grade \u22653, 2%). Liso-cel demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with R/R FL, including high-risk 2L FL. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04245839 .",

        "Abstract": "Public health practice appears poised to undergo a transformative shift as a result of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). These changes will usher in a new era of public health, charged with responding to deficiencies identified during the COVID-19 pandemic and managing investments required to meet the health needs of the twenty-first century. In this Commentary, we explore how AI is being used in public health, and we describe the advanced capabilities of generative AI models capable of producing synthetic content such as images, videos, audio, text, and other digital content. Viewing the use of AI from the perspective of health departments in the United States, we examine how this new technology can support core public health functions with a focus on near-term opportunities to improve communication, optimize organizational performance, and generate novel insights to drive decision making. Finally, we review the challenges and risks associated with these technologies, offering suggestions for health officials to harness the new tools to accomplish public health goals.",

        "Abstract": "Reproductive outcomes after uterine artery embolization (UAE) for the treatment of uterine fibroids are challenging to study, leaving several unanswered questions surrounding the future fertility of patients undergoing the procedure. Subject matter experts from interventional radiology, diagnostic radiology, obstetrics and gynecology, and reproductive medicine participated in a Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Foundation Research Consensus Panel to discuss and prioritize critical research topics focusing on fertility and reproductive outcomes in patients undergoing UAE for symptomatic uterine fibroids. After presentations and discussion of research ideas, the panelists prioritized the following topics for further investigation: (a) a prospective study of factors that influence implantation and gene expression in patients undergoing UAE or myomectomy over 1 year; (b) refinement of a classification system for uterine fibroids that can allow for more focused study design, which may include burden of fibroid disease; and (c) conjoint analysis/discrete choice experiments to better characterize those patients for whom fertility preservation is a high priority.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, the intra-operative visualization of vessels during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) relies on contrast-based imaging modalities. Moreover, traditional image fusion techniques lack a continuous and automatic update of the vessel configuration, which changes due to the insertion of stiff guidewires. The purpose of this work is to develop and evaluate a novel approach to improve image fusion, that takes into account the deformations, combining electromagnetic (EM) tracking technology and finite element modeling (FEM).",

        "Abstract": "The intricate origins and diverse symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose significant challenges for both diagnosis and treatment. Exosomes and microvesicles, which carry disease-specific cargo from a variety of central nervous system cell types, have emerged as promising reservoirs of biomarkers for AD. Research on the screening of possible biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease using proteomic profiling of EVs is systematically reviewed in this comprehensive review. We highlight key methodologies employed in EV isolation, characterization, and proteomic analysis, elucidating their advantages and limitations. Furthermore, we summarize the evolving landscape of EV-associated biomarkers implicated in AD pathogenesis, including proteins involved in amyloid-beta metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal injury. The literature review highlights the necessity for robust validation strategies and standardized protocols to effectively transition EV-based biomarkers into clinical use. In the concluding section, this review delves into potential future avenues and technological advancements pivotal in crafting EV-derived biomarkers applicable to AD diagnostics and prognostics. This review contributes to our comprehension of AD pathology and the advancement of precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases, hinting at a promising era in AD precision medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) are a group of structural abnormalities or defects of the heart that are present at birth. CHDs could be connected to sudden death (SD), defined by the WHO (World Health Organization) as \"death occurring within 24 h after the onset of the symptoms\" in an apparently \"healthy\" subject. These conditions can range from relatively mild defects to severe, life-threatening anomalies. The prevalence of CHDs varies across populations, but they affect millions of individuals worldwide. This article aims to discuss the post-mortem investigation of death related to CHDs, exploring the forensic approach, current methodologies, challenges, and potential advancements in this challenging field. A further goal of this article is to provide a guide for understanding these complex diseases, highlighting the pivotal role of autopsy, histopathology, and genetic investigations in defining the cause of death, and providing evidence about the translational use of autopsy reports. Forensic investigations play a crucial role in understanding the complexities of CHDs and determining the cause of death accurately. Through collaboration between medical professionals and forensic experts, meticulous examinations, and analysis of evidence, valuable insights can be gained. These insights not only provide closure to the families affected but also contribute to the prevention of future tragedies.",

        "Title": "Health-related social control among U.S. adults ages 30-80: Associations with alcohol use over four years.",
        "Abstract": "Health-related social control (HRSC) includes efforts to regulate or influence others' health behaviors and is an important way interpersonal relationships can affect individual-level health. This study used egocentric network data to describe the size and composition of HRSC networks, identify trajectories of HRSC receipt, and examine how HRSC is related to binge drinking and alcohol-related problems. Data come from a U.S. nationally representative sample of 1235 adults age 30 and older (baseline mean age\u00a0=\u00a052, 52% female, 64% White) who completed four annual surveys between 2019 and 2022. On average, 30% of adults' network members were HRSC agents who told or reminded them to do things to protect their health. At baseline, 50% of respondents identified a spouse/partner as a HRSC agent, 56% a relative, 46% a friend, and 12% someone else. Respondents' relationships with HRSC agents were generally strong, 93% of agents were described as people \"whose opinion matters,\" and only 10% were described as hassling or making life difficult for the respondent. Growth mixture modeling identified five trajectories of HRSC receipt over the four-year period: Stable High (36% of sample), Stable Moderate (47%), Stable Low (14%), Decreasing (2%), and Increasing (2%). Binge drinking was relatively consistent for the three Stable HRSC classes (ranging from 11% to 15% of individuals), decreased steadily for the Increasing HRSC class (32%-16%), and fluctuated for the Decreasing HRSC class (decreasing from 10% to 2%, then increasing to 8%). For alcohol problems, the Increasing HRSC class showed the largest increase (2%-21%) before dropping to near-baseline levels (4%), whereas the Decreasing HRSC class fluctuated during the first three waves followed by no individuals reporting alcohol problems at the last wave. Results highlight the importance of examining heterogeneity in adults' HRSC experiences because of its implications for understanding social influences on health-related behaviors.",

We calculated reported unfair treatment rates overall and by enrollee characteristics. Nine percent of respondents reported any unfair treatment, most often based on health condition (6%), disability (3%), or age (2%). Approximately 40% of those reporting any unfair treatment endorsed multiple categories. People who qualified for Medicare via disability reported unfair treatment by disability, age, income, race and ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, and gender/gender identity more often than those who qualified via age. Enrollees dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid or eligible for a Low-Income Subsidy (DE/LIS) reported unfair treatment by disability, income, language/accent, race and ethnicity, culture/religion, and sex more often than non-DE/LIS enrollees. Compared with White respondents, racial and ethnic minority respondents more often reported unfair treatment by race and ethnicity, language/accent, culture/religion, and income. Female respondents were more likely than male respondents to report unfair treatment based on age and sex.",

        "Abstract": "Are teenage and adult smoking causally related? Recent anti-tobacco policy is predicated on the assumption that preventing teenagers from smoking will ensure that fewer adults smoke, but direct evidence in support of this assumption is scant. Using data from three nationally representative sources and instrumenting for teenage smoking with cigarette taxes experienced at ages 14-17, we document a strong positive relationship between teenage and adult smoking: deterring 10 teenagers from smoking through raising cigarette taxes roughly translates into 5 fewer adult smokers. We conclude that efforts to reduce teenage smoking can have long-lasting consequences on smoking participation and, presumably, health.",

        "Abstract": "We developed an expert panel approach for identifying expert views on the effectiveness and implementability of population-level policy interventions. ROMPER-the RAND/USC OPTIC Method for Policy Expert Ratings-involves an online, three-round, modified-Delphi process:\u2022Experts rate and comment on policies according to domains of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Evidence-to-Decision framework.\u2022To identify consensus on policy effectiveness and implementability, expert ratings are analyzed using the Inter-Percentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry (IPRAS) technique from the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and visualized using a forest plot. To explain consensus, expert comments are analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis and reported following the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research.\u2022To provide actionable information for decisionmakers, each policy is summarized in a \"Policy Profile\" adapted from GRADEPro Evidence-to-Decision tables.We validated ROMPER in two studies that successfully recruited the targeted sample size, retained experts through all three rounds, and examined consensus on which policies are (not) effective and implementable. ROMPER protocols, materials, data, and code are openly available on the Open Science Framework with Creative Commons licensing for replication and reuse. ROMPER provides a validated, replicable, open access approach for eliciting expert views on both policy effectiveness and implementability-and for summarizing (lack of) consensus specifically for policymakers.",

        "Abstract": "Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) is a clinical sequela of central nervous system metastasis involving the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), often seen in late-stage solid tumors. It has a grave prognosis without urgent treatment. Standard of care methodologies to diagnose LMD include CSF cytology, magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical evaluation. These methods offer limited sensitivity and specificity for the evaluation of LMD. Here, we describe the analytic performance characteristics of a microfluidic-based tumor cell enrichment and detection assay optimized to detect epithelial cells in CSF using both contrived samples as well as CSF from patients having suspected or confirmed LMD from carcinomas.",

        "Abstract": "Atmospheric pollution is a major public health issue and has become increasingly critical for human health. Urban atmospheric pollution is typically assessed through physicochemical indicators aligned with environmental legislation parameters, providing data on air quality levels. While the effects of pollution on sensitive organisms serve as a warning for public health decision-makers, there remains a need to explore the interpretation of environmental data on pollutants. The use of species adapted to urban environments as sentinels enables continuous and integrated monitoring of environmental pollution implications on biological systems. In this study, we investigated the use of the plant species Tradescantia pallida as a biomonitor to evaluate the genotoxic effects of atmospheric pollution under diverse vehicular traffic conditions. T. pallida was strategically planted at the leading urban intersections in Uberl\u00e2ndia, Brazil. During COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, we compared indicators such as physical, biological, and traffic data at different intersections in residential and commercial zones. The reduction in vehicular traffic highlighted the sensitivity of plant species to changes in air and soil pollutants. T. pallida showed bioaccumulation of heavy metals Cd and Cr in monitored areas with higher traffic levels. Additionally, we established a multiple linear regression model to estimate genotoxicity using the micronucleus test, with chromium concentration in the soil (X1) and particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere (X2) identified as the primary independent variables. Our findings provide a comprehensive portrait of the impact of vehicular traffic changes on PM and offer valuable insights for refining parameters and models of Environmental Health Surveillance.",

        "Abstract": "Markers that allow for the selection of tailored treatments for individual patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are yet to be identified. Our aim was to describe trends in real-life treatment usage. For this purpose, patients from the ENEIDA registry who received their first targeted IBD treatment (biologics or tofacitinib) between 2015 and 2021 were included. A subsequent analysis with Machine Learning models was performed. The study included 10,009 patients [71% with Crohn's disease (CD) and 29% with ulcerative colitis (UC)]. In CD, anti-TNF (predominantly adalimumab) were the main agents in the 1st line of treatment (LoT), although their use declined over time. In UC, anti-TNF (mainly infliximab) use was predominant in 1st LoT, remaining stable over time. Ustekinumab and vedolizumab were the most prescribed drugs in 2nd and 3rd LoT in CD and UC, respectively. Overall, the use of biosimilars increased over time. Machine Learning failed to identify a model capable of predicting treatment patterns. In conclusion, drug positioning is different in CD and UC. Anti-TNF were the most used drugs in IBD 1st LoT, being adalimumab predominant in CD and infliximab in UC. Ustekinumab and vedolizumab have gained importance in CD and UC, respectively. The approval of biosimilars had a significant impact on treatment.",

Methylglyoxal accumulated in plasma and urine of hyperglycemic and diabetic individuals acts as a potent peptide glycation molecule, giving rise to advanced glycation end products (AGEs) like arginine-derived hydroimidazolone (MG-H1) and carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL). Methylglyoxal-derived AGEs exert their effects mostly via activation of RAGE, a cell surface receptor that initiates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, favoring a pro-oxidant environment through NADPH oxidase activation and generation of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Diabetic bladder dysfunction is a bothersome urological complication in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and may comprise overactive bladder, urge incontinence, poor emptying, dribbling, incomplete emptying of the bladder, and urinary retention. Preclinical models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes have further confirmed the relationship between diabetes and voiding dysfunction. Interestingly, healthy mice supplemented with MGO for prolonged periods exhibit in vivo and in vitro bladder dysfunction, which is accompanied by increased AGE formation and RAGE expression, as well as by ROS overproduction in bladder tissues. Drugs reported to scavenge MGO and to inactivate AGEs like metformin, polyphenols, and alagebrium (ALT-711) have shown favorable outcomes on bladder dysfunction in diabetic obese leptin-deficient and MGO-exposed mice. Therefore, MGO, AGEs, and RAGE levels may be critically involved in the pathogenesis of bladder dysfunction in diabetic individuals. However, there are no clinical trials designed to test drugs that selectively inhibit the MGO-AGEs-RAGE signaling, aiming to reduce the manifestations of diabetes-associated bladder dysfunction. This review summarizes the current literature on the role of MGO-AGEs-RAGE-ROS axis in diabetes-associated bladder dysfunction. Drugs that directly inactivate MGO and ameliorate bladder dysfunction are also reviewed here.",

Its determination is an essential reference to the quality of biofuel and a significant parameter to be determined. This parameter concerns the quality of the biodiesel to be supplied to the consumer, and its determination is fundamental to maintaining the engine's proper functioning. Raman spectroscopy allows the rapid obtaining of structural information regarding biodiesel quality and, when aided by multivariate analysis methods, allows a quantitative determination of specific properties. This work uses Raman spectroscopy, Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternative Least Squares (MCR-ALS) method, and Evolving Factor Analysis (EFA) to study biodiesel's oxidation kinetics.

        "Abstract": "Today, colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis is performed using colonoscopy, which is the current, most effective screening method. However, colonoscopy poses risks of harm to the patient and is an invasive process. Recent research has proven metabolomics as a potential, non-invasive detection method, which can use identified biomarkers to detect potential cancer in a patient's body. The aim of this study is to develop a machine-learning (ML) model based on chemical descriptors that will recognize CRC-associated metabolites. We selected a set of metabolites found as the biomarkers of CRC, confirmed that they participate in cancer-related pathways, and used them for training a machine-learning model for the diagnostics of CRC. Using a set of selective metabolites and random compounds, we developed a range of ML models. The best performing ML model trained on Stage 0-2 CRC metabolite data predicted a metabolite class with 89.55% accuracy. The best performing ML model trained on Stage 3-4 CRC metabolite data predicted a metabolite class with 95.21% accuracy. Lastly, the best-performing ML model trained on Stage 0-4 CRC metabolite data predicted a metabolite class with 93.04% accuracy. These models were then tested on independent datasets, including random and unrelated-disease metabolites. In addition, six pathways related to these CRC metabolites were also distinguished: aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; arginine biosynthesis; and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Thus, in this research study, we created machine-learning models based on metabolite-related descriptors that may be helpful in developing a non-invasive diagnosis method for CRC.",

        "Abstract": "A growing body of literature uses the concept of core components to better understand small-scale programmatic interventions. Instead of interventions being viewed as unitary \"black boxes,\" interventions are viewed as configurations of core components, which are the parts of interventions that carry their causal potential and therefore need to be reproduced with fidelity to produce the intended effect. To date, the concept of core components has not been as widely applied to public health policy interventions as it has to programmatic interventions. The purpose of this topical review is to familiarize public health practitioners and policy makers with the concept of core components as applied to public health policy interventions. Raising the profile of core component thinking can foster mindful adaptation and implementation of public health policy interventions while encouraging further research to enhance the supporting evidence base. We present 3 types of multilevel interactions in which the core components of a public health policy intervention produce effects at the population level by (1) seeking to directly affect individual behavior, (2) facilitating adoption of programmatic interventions by intermediaries, and (3) encouraging intermediaries to take action that can shape changes in upstream drivers of population health. Changing the unit of analysis from whole policies to core components can provide a basis for understanding how policies work and for facilitating novel evidence-generating strategies and rapid evidence reviews that can inform future adaptation efforts.",

        "Abstract": "While insurance is integral for accessing healthcare in the US, coverage alone may not ensure access, especially for those publicly insured. Access barriers for Medicaid-insured patients are rooted in social drivers of health, insurance complexities in the setting of managed care plans, and federal- and state-level policies. Elucidating barriers at the health system level may reveal opportunities for sustainable solutions.",

However, a gap exists in understanding the comprehensive value-based perspectives of other professionals involved in both somatic and psychiatric euthanasia. This paper aims to analyze the interplay among legal, medical, and ethical factors to clarify how foundational values shape the ethical discourse surrounding euthanasia in both somatic and psychiatric contexts. It seeks to explore these dynamics among all healthcare professionals and volunteers in Belgium.",

As a consequence, data from individual subjects appears in both the training and the test set. Could high test-set accuracy reflect data leakage from subject-specific patterns in the data, rather than patterns that identify a disease? We address this question by testing the performance of DNN classifiers using segment-based holdout (in which segments from one subject can appear in both the training and test set), and comparing this to their performance using subject-based holdout (where all segments from one subject appear exclusively in either the training set or the test set). In two datasets (one classifying Alzheimer's disease, and the other classifying epileptic seizures), we find that performance on previously-unseen subjects is strongly overestimated when models are trained using segment-based holdout. Finally, we survey the literature and find that the majority of translational DNN-EEG studies use segment-based holdout. Most published DNN-EEG studies may dramatically overestimate their classification performance on new subjects.",
