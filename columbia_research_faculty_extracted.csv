"Hashim M. Al-Hashimi, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"Al-Hashimi is interested in developing a deep, quantitative, and predictive understanding of cellular processes based on the fundamental behaviors of nucleic acids and their interactions with protein binding partners.  Over the past two decades, Al-Hashimi and his trainees developed approaches combining NMR spectroscopy, computational modeling, optical melting experiments, and chemical probing to determine 3D dynamic ensembles of RNA and DNA molecules at atomic resolution.  Using dynamic ensembles of nucleic acids, the Al-Hashimi group has developed quantitative and predictive models for several fundamental biological processes, including DNA replication fidelity, Tat-dependent HIV-1 transcriptional activation, RNA folding, and the impact of post-transcriptional modifications such as m6A and Nm on translation, splicing, and RNA-protein interactions.  These studies have reshaped structural biology, revealing dynamic ensembles as the fundamental behavior of biomolecules needed to understand and predict cellular activity quantitatively.The Al-Hashimi lab is currently using dynamic ensembles to reconstitute the folding and cellular activities of viral and other non-coding RNAs, to determine the role of DNA structural dynamics in shaping the probabilities of mutagenesis and cancer, and to rationally design inhibitors targeting viral RNA regulatory elements in HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 as well as non-coding RNAs involved in cancer.  Efforts include developing and applying high throughput sequencing-based approaches to map DNA structural dynamics genome-wide, developing high throughput assays for quantitatively measuring the activity of various steps in the HIV-1 lifecycle, and determining an atlas of dynamic ensembles for all nucleic acid building block motifs.  A more recent area includes efforts to digitize biochemistry by describing biomolecules in terms of finite-state-computing machines and applying complexity theory to classifying biochemical reactions.As a mentor, Al-Hashimi is strongly committed to creating a welcoming, enriching, and supportive environment for all his trainees and effectively preparing them for careers in science.  To date, he has trained over thirty-five graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with backgrounds in biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, and mathematics.  His alumni include heads of laboratories at universities in the US, France, Sweden, India, and China and scientists at many biotech companies, large pharmaceutical firms, and management consulting firms.  Over 30 undergraduates have also worked in the Al-Hashimi laboratory.Al-Hashimi Lab:https://www.biochem.cuimc.columbia.edu/research/research-labs/al-hashimi...",Mechanisms of Cancer-Causing Mutations NMR Spectroscopy Nucleic Acid Structural Dynamics In Vitro and In Vivo RNA Biology and Drug Discovery,"Zhang, Q., Sun, X., Watt, E.D., & Al-Hashimi, H.M., Resolving the motional modes that code for RNA adaptation.

"Richard Axel, MD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"Mammals possess an olfactory system of inordinate discriminatory power. We are studying how the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception is accomplished. Our analysis of the patterns of expression of the odorant receptor genes, coupled with earlier electrophysiologic experiments have provided a logic for olfactory discrimination. Individual olfactory sensory neurons express only one of a thousand receptor genes. Neurons expressing a given receptor, although randomly distributed in domains in the epithelium, project their axons to a small number of topographically fixed loci or glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. These data support a model of olfactory coding in which discrimination of odor quality would result from the detection of specific spatial patterns of activity in the olfactory bulb.",Neurogenetics Sensory Physiology Synapses and Circuits,"2015 Gore F, Schwartz EC, Brangers BC, Aladi S, Stujenske JM, Likhtik E, Russo MJ, Gordon JA, Salzman CD, Axel R.

"Anum Glasgow, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"The diversity of natural proteins shapes cell- and tissue-level structure and behavior, and advances in protein engineering have enabled the de novo design of artificial, super-stable proteins. But real proteins have evolved to depend on biomolecular interactions and conformational flexibility in order to balance stability with function. A key challenge in protein engineering is our limited mechanistic understanding of how proteins’ conformational ensembles are poised to perform non-equilibrium processes, which enable their functions.Our research group combines computational protein design with high-throughput biophysical techniques to study biomolecular conformational changes, towards engineering proteins that change conformations, interact with other molecules, and cross membranes in response to signals. Design principles for building signal-responsive, conformation-switching proteins can guide efforts to control the behavior and development of living systems and treat diseases without disrupting healthy cells. Our long-term goal is to engineer multi-functional proteins and therapeutics that respond to ligand binding and correct localization via programmed conformational changes. This work serves the public by growing our knowledge of biomolecular behavior and opening new paths to treat disease.Website:https://www.glasgowlab.org",N/A,"A. Glasgow*, J. Glasgow*, D. Limonta, P.

"Stephen P. Goff, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"Goff’s current work is centered on the study of the retrovirus life cycle and the host restriction systems that inhibit virus replication. His lab identified and characterized a novel host protein, termed ZAP for zinc finger antiviral protein, that blocks gene expression of many viruses, including the murine leukemia viruses, Ebola, Sindbis, and HIV-1, by degrading viral mRNAs and inhibiting their translation. Recent work has identified RIPLET, a signaling molecule in annate immunity, as a cofactor for ZAP. The lab has also characterized a protein complex responsible for the silencing of retroviral DNAs in embryonic stem (ES) cells, and identified a zinc finger protein, ZFP809, as an ES-cell specific recognition molecule that binds the proviral DNA and brings TRIM28 to locally modify chromatin. His lab is currently studying the chromatinization and silencing of incoming retroviral DNAs after acute infection, implicating several histone modifiers and the H1 linker histones as players in silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNAs.

"Max E. Gottesman, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"My laboratory investigates the mechanism of transcription termination in E. coli and how termination affects other cellular processes. Blocking the release of a stalled transcription elongation complex leads to clashes with the replisome and the formation of lethal DNA double-strand breaks. Coupling of transcription to translation suppresses stalling. NusG links RNA polymerase and the first translating ribosome. The linkage is broken by tmRNA, which releases ribosomes at rare codons. The interactions among ribosomes, RNA polymerase and DNA polymerase are being investigated using genetic and biochemical approaches.

"Eric C.  Greene, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"Our group uses single-molecule optical microscopy to study fundamental interactions between proteins and nucleic acids. Our overall goal is to reveal the molecular mechanisms that cells use to repair, maintain, and decode their genetic information. This research combines aspects of biochemistry, physics, and nanoscale technology to answer questions about complex biological problems that cannot be easily addressed through traditional biochemical approaches. As part of our work, we have established robust experimental platforms that enable single molecule imaging of biochemical reaction mechanisms in a “high throughput” experimental format that can be applied to the study of protein-nucleic acid interactions. The advantages of our approaches are that we can see what proteins are bound to DNA, where they are bound, how they move, and how they interact with and influence other components of the system – all in real-time, at the level of a single reaction.

Greenwald, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"Research in my laboratory is unified by my belief in the “awesome power ofC. elegansgenetics to identify and illuminate conserved mechanisms that mediate cell-cell interactions in animal development. Much of our work is concerned with LIN-12/Notch, one of the major signaling systems for specifying cell fate during animal development. Mutations in core components and modulators of the LIN-12/Notch signaling system have been implicated in cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and developmental diseases and syndromes. UsingC. elegans, we study how LIN-12/Notch signaling is modulated during normal development and identify potential ways it may be modulated to combat disease.We are currently investigating the fundamental logic and molecular events that govern how multipotential cells make cell fate decisions; using sensitive and specific suppressor and enhancer screens to identify new, conserved modulators of LIN-12/Notch and other signaling pathways with potential disease relevance; and studying cell fate programming and reprogramming during organogenesis and in alternative life histories..",cell-cell interactions and cell fate specification integration of signaling events in development LIN-12/Notch signaling and its modulation organogenesis Grants NEW MODES AND MECHANISMS OF NEGATIVE REGULATION OF LIN-12/NOTCH IN C .

"Oliver Hobert, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"The main focus of the laboratory is to understand the molecular mechanisms that generate the astounding diversity of cell types in a nervous system. Using the C.elegans model system, we have revealed a core regulatory logic for how terminal neuronal identity is controlled in several different neuron types. We have demonstrated that these regulatory mechanisms are conserved in chordates. These insights have allowed us to reprogram the identity of heterologous cell types to that of specific neuron types. Venturing into a little explored area of neuronal diversification, we have developed a novel paradigm to study asymmetry across the left/right axis, by far the least understood axis in any nervous system, and identified a complex gene regulatory network that differentially controls terminal neuron identity across this axis.Aside from our main focus on neuronal development, we have also studied the molecular machinery with which the nervous system responds to the environment (i) to modulate behavior and (ii) to ensure that it maintains its functional and structural integrity.Employing new technologies that we developed, we continue to exploit the simplicity and experimental amenability of the worm to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the genetic programs that control the development of theC.elegansnervous system and we will continue to extend these insights to vertebrates.",Axon Pathfinding and Synaptogenesis Cell Specification and Differentiation Cellular/Molecular/Developmental Neuroscience Neurogenetics Synapses and Circuits,"Kratsios, P, Pinan-LucarrÃ©, B, Kerk, SY, Bessereau, JL and Hobert, O (2015) ""Transcriptional coordination of synaptogenesis and neurotransmitter signaling"", Curr.

"Arthur Karlin, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"Understanding the function of molecular receptors has been my guiding interest and the central mission of the Center. Receptors function in three steps: signal recognition, transduction, and transmission. This is exemplified by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, on which I worked for forty years. These receptors bind acetylcholine, transduce this binding into the opening of a pore, and conduct cations causing a depolarization of the synaptic membrane. We identified the overall receptor structure and, within this, the specific sites and substructures at the front-line of these functional steps. More recently, this approach was applied to the BK channel, a voltage- and calcium-ion-activated channel, widely expressed and responsible for membrane hyperpolarization.Also recently, I began to consider cellular functions that depend on circuits of signaling components. Cellular function depends on the functions of individual molecular components and on their coordination via direct or indirect interactions. Cellular function also depends on cellular structure and on the distribution of the functional molecular components in these structures. Crucial to the specificity and effectiveness of the interactions among functional components are microdomains, which both channel and amplify the signals between components. My approach to understanding such systems is to represent all steps as kinetic equations, consistent with thermodynamics, and to solve the resulting equations in time and space. To the extent that experimental data exist, the equations are fit to these data. Such a model is a mathematical summary of the known properties of the components and of the target cellular function. Notwithstanding, such a model is a hypothetical outline of how the cell might function, always wanting experimental tests and refinement.",Biochemistry and Biophysics Systems Biology,"Rahman MM, Teng J, Worrell BT, Noviello CM, Lee M, Karlin A, Stowell MHB, Hibbs RE.

"Peter D. Kwong, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"At Columbia University, my research has focused on Antibodyomics, the informatics of antibody recognition, development, and improvement. Numerous antibodies have been identified from HIV-1-infected donors that neutralize diverse strains of HIV-1. These antibodies could provide the basis for a B cell-mediated HIV-1 vaccine. However, it has been unclear how to elicit similar antibodies by vaccination. To address this issue, my group along with colleagues from Columbia University (L. Shapiro, B. Honig, R. Friesner) and elsewhere (Academia Sinica, ADARC, NIH, Vanderbilt University, University of Kansas) have undertaken an informatics-based approach to understand the genetic and immunologic processes controlling the development of HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies. As genetic information is currently the fastest growing database of biological information, we have focused on incorporating next-generation sequencing of B cell transcripts to determine the origin, maturation pathway, and prevalence of broadly neutralizing antibody lineages (Antibodyomics1, 2, 4, and 6). We have also incorporated large-scale robotic analyses of serum neutralization to identify and quantify neutralizing antibodies from donor cohorts (Antibodyomics3). Statistical analyses furnish another layer of insight (Antibodyomics5), with informatics incorporating physical characteristics of antibodies and their targets through molecular dynamics simulations and with free energy perturbation analyses providing information-rich output (Antibodyomics7 and 8). Functional interrogation of individual antibodies (Antibodyomics9) and synthetic antibody libraries (Antibodyomics10) also yields multi-dimensional data by which to understand and improve antibodies. Antibodyomics thus comprise resolution-enhancing tools, which collectively embody an information-driven discovery engine towards development of effective B cell-based vaccines. These efforts synergize with the efforts of my group at the Vaccine Research Center, NIH (see website athttps://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/peter-kwong-phd-structural-biology-se...), which seeks to apply structural biology to the development of vaccines against HIV-1 and other human pathogens.",N/A,N/A,"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/peter-kwong-phd-structural-biology-section, https://www.linkedin.com/company/2623/"

"Michal Levo, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"Coordinated activation of subsets of genes, at specific tissues and developmental times, governs cell fate decisions and cellular behavior. We now know that genomes are replete with regulatory sequences guiding this spatiotemporal activation of genes. Developmental disorders and diseases are often associated with disruptions to this regulatory code. As our mapping of eukaryotic genomes improved in the last few decades, we learned that the number of regulatory DNA elements greatly exceeds the number of genes, and these elements can reside far away along the genome from their target gene. What are the mechanisms that mediate gene regulation within this genomic labyrinth remains an open question. How do regulatory elements communicate with their target genes? What ensures the right regulatory interactions take place at specific cells and times? What are the molecular agents bringing the regulatory instruction to life? And how are properties of the local chromatin environment and the broader 3D genome organization related to the regulation of gene activity?The Levo lab combines several experimental modalities (from genomic assays to live subcellular imaging), with computational analysis and modeling, to study the dynamic, multilayered control of gene expression in the service of differentiation and development.

"Stavros Lomvardas, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"Our research program aims to understand the molecular mechanisms of olfactory receptor gene choice. Olfactory receptor (OR) genes compose the largest mammalian gene family consisted of more than 1000 members. These genes are expressed in a stochastic and mutually exclusive fashion in such a way that only one OR allele is expressed in each olfactory sensory neuron. Our data suggest that this unusual expression pattern is orchestrated by a combination of positive and negative regulatory mechanism. According to our findings, OR genes undergo chromatin mediated silencing at a developmental stage that precedes olfactory receptor activation. One of the 3000 alleles is chosen for activation, by the enzymatic removal of the silencing chromatin marks. We currently combine genetic and biochemical approaches that together with cutting edge microscopy should reveal critical mechanistic details of this process.",Sensory Physiology Snapses and Circuits,"Dalton RP, Lyons DB, Lomvardas S.

"Tom Maniatis, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"The primary focus of my lab during the past 10 years has been in two areas: 1. Disease mechanisms of ALS, which involves a combination of human genetic, stem cell and animal model approaches, and 2. The structure and function of the clustered protocadherin (Pcdh) genes. We have used behavioral assays in both projects to characterize the phenotypic consequences of mutations in mouse models. The ALS animal model work has involved the use of various neuromuscular behavioral studies of the SOD1 G93A mouse model, while the protocadherin project has involved studies of both motor function and affective behavior (depression and anxiety). Manuscripts describing both studies are under review. The most recent ALS work is a study of the role of autophagy in ALS disease progression, and these studies involved various studies of motor function such as the rotarod test for motor coordination and muscle strength. The protocadherin studies involve various assays for affective function (anxiety and depression), in Pcdha gene cluster deletion mice. We have shown that these mice display a cell-autonomous serotonergic wiring phenotype, and have characterized the behavioral consequences. Recent human genetic studies from other laboratories have implicated the Pcdh gene cluster in autism and other neurological diseases. We have generated a series of well-characterized deletion mutants in the Pcdh gene cluster, and are characterizing their behavioral phenotypes. Thus, the behavior core is central to our ongoing and future studies.",ALS Disease Mechanisms Genetic Basis of Neurological Diseases Neurobiology of Disease Regulation of RNA Transcription and Splicing Stem Cell Biology Synapses and Circuits The Role of Neuroinflammation in ALS,"Publications List Columbia University Irving Medical Center NewYork-Presbyterian ColumbiaDoctors About Us Education Research Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics 701 West 168th Street New York , NY 10032 United States Follow Us Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn © 2024 Columbia University Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions HIPAA General Information: 212-305-2862 Back to top","http://maniatislab.columbia.edu/publications.php.html, https://www.linkedin.com/company/2623/"
"Richard S. Mann, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"Our lab uses the fruit fly,Drosophilamelanogaster, to study three main problems: Hox protein function and specificity; appendage development; and the development and function of the adult motor system. Our work on Hox proteins centers around two questions: 1) how these homeodomain-containing transcription factors achieve specificityin vivoand 2) what are the relevant target genes that these factors regulate to control morphogenesis? To answer these questions, we are using a variety of in vitro DNA binding assays, structural biology,invivoreporter gene assays, and genome-wide methods to discover and validate Hox target genes and Hox binding sites. Genetic methods are used to analyze the function of putative target genes and their specific contributions to morphology. Our work on appendage development focuses on two questions: 1) how is positional information generated along the proximo-distal (PD) axis and 2) how is cell proliferation regulated and coordinated with cell differentiation? To answer the first question, our main approach is to dissect at high resolution the transcriptional responses of genes expressed at specific positions along the PD axis, primarily in the legs. To answer the second question, we are identifying the genes and pathways that selector genes regulate to modulate cell proliferation during appendage development. Our work on the adult motor system stems from our work on leg development. Here, we are studying how the motor neurons that innervate the adult leg are generated and specified to target the correct muscles and generate the correct dendritic pattern in the CNS. Using this information, we are beginning to study how the movement of the legs is coordinated by local interneurons and sensory feedback. Locomotion assays to study adult walking behavior are used to analyze the wild type circuitry and the consequences to when this circuit is perturbed.Up to date information on the Mann lab can be found athttps://mannlab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/",Axon Pathfinding and Synaptogenesis Cell Specification and Differentiation Cellular/Molecular/Developmental Neuroscience Neurogenetics Stem Cell Biology,"Mendes CS, Bartos I, MÃ¡rka Z, Akay T, MÃ¡rka S, Mann RS.

"Lawrence S. Shapiro, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"The nervous system is unique and remarkable in the complexity of the precise interconnections among its component cells. The human brain is composed of roughly ten billion neurons, each of which can participate in thousands of connections. Thus, the genetically-directed assembly of the nervous system involves formation of about 1013 specific interconnections between neurons. Implementation of this extraordinarily precise program depends on the controlled spatial and temporal expression of selective adhesion molecules on neural cell surfaces. Although the full complement of proteins responsible for specific adhesion in the nervous system remains unclear, many families of neural adhesion molecules have been identified and studied in detail. Our focus is on structural studies of neural adhesion molecules to reveal the molecular basis of their function and atomic-level details of their binding specificity.Much of our efforts are focused on the cadherins, a large family of cell surface proteins that mediate adhesive binding between cells in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Crystal Structures of cadherins show that binding interactions form only between the N-terminal domains of the extracellular regions. The idea that these domains encode cadherin cell adhesive specificity has been verified by structre-based mutagenesis experiments. There are several subfamilies of cadherins expressed in the nervous system, including type I, type II, and protocadherins. The sorting of motor neuron pools is dependent on the unique distributions of type II cadherins expressed by the cells of each motor neuron pool.Our long-term goal is to determine the atomic-level basis for specific adhesion in a variety of neural systems.",Axon Pathfinding and Synaptogenesis Biophysics/Ion Channels Cellular/Molecular/Developmental Neuroscience Synapses and Circuits,"Chen, C.P., Posy,S., Ben-Shaul, A., Shapiro, L., Honig, B.

"Anna-Lena Steckelberg, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"Our lab is interested in understanding how viruses manipulate gene expression in infected cells. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely on the cellular gene expression machinery for replication; consequently, the abilities of virus and host cell to control gene expression play critical roles during the establishment of viral infection. Many viruses have evolved elegant strategies to co-opt and manipulate cellular processes for their own benefit, but conversely, eukaryotic cells use specialized branches of gene expression pathways to respond to and eradicate viruses. In the Steckelberg lab, we combine biochemical, structural (x-ray crystallography and cryoEM) and cell biological methods to study the molecular interactions that regulate gene expression during infection with RNA viruses of the flaviviridae and coronaviridae families. Studying how viruses hijack cellular processes provides insight into the life cycle of important human pathogens but also expands our understanding of the cellular machinery itself. By studying RNA-protein interactions at the host-virus interface we thus strive to deconstruct molecular networks that regulate gene expression in human cells.Visit ourwebsiteto learn more.",N/A,"Jones RA, Steckelberg AL , Vicens Q, Szucs MJ, Akiyama BM, Kieft JS. “Different tertiary interactions create the same important 3-D features in a distinct flavivirus xrRNA.” RNA 2020 Oct 1;rna.077065.120 Steckelberg AL *, Vicens Q*, Costantino DA, Nix JC, Kieft JS. “The crystal structure of a Polerovirus exoribonuclease-resistant RNA shows how diverse sequences are integrated into a conserved fold.” RNA 2020 Aug 26;rna.076224.120 Steckelberg AL *, Vicens Q*, Kieft JS. “Exoribonuclease-Resistant RNAs Exist within both Coding and Noncoding Subgenomic RNAs.” mBio. 2018 Dec 18;9(6):e02461-18.

"Samuel Sternberg, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"At a cellular level, organisms face two fundamental challenges: maintaining integrity of the genome in response to mobile genetic elements and mutagens, and expressing a specific repertoire of genes at the correct time and proper level. It is now widely recognized that noncoding RNAs play crucial and surprisingly diverse roles in controlling both the expression of DNA, via transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation, and the content of DNA itself, by mediating sequence-specific DNA cleavage events. The recent discovery of pervasive genome defense systems in bacteria and archaea known as CRISPR–Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats–CRISPR-associated), and the development of these systems for genome engineering, highlight the biological power and technological potential of RNA-guided DNA control.The Sternberg Lab broadly strives to expand our understanding of the ways in which noncoding RNAs conspire with effector proteins to target DNA. Focusing on evolutionarily distinct but analogous systems in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and using a combination of biochemistry, structural biology, biophysics, and genetics, we are uncovering new biological function while simultaneously advancing novel tools with which to precisely manipulate the genome.

"Chaolin Zhang, PhD",Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics,"Dr. Chaolin Zhang's lab takes a multidisciplinary approach to studying mechanisms and functions of post-transcriptional gene regulation, in particular alternative splicing in both normal and disease contexts. On the mechanistic side, the Zhang lab focuses on fundamental understanding of the targeting specificity of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), how they regulate alternative splicing in various cellular contexts, especially in the nervous system, and how such regulation can be disrupted by mutations and genetic variations. On the functional side, the lab aims to uncover the roles of RBPs in determining the neuronal cell fate, morphological and functional properties during neural differentiation and maturation. More recently, the lab has also been working on translating fundamental knowledge on RNA regulation to precision genetic medicine, with a particular focus on multiple devastating monogenic diseases affecting the central nervous system.Dr. Zhang and his lab have pioneered RNA Systems Biology approaches to investigating splicing-regulatory networks. Dr. Zhang’s work has led to breakthroughs in mapping protein-RNA interactions at single-nucleotide resolution on a genome-wide scale (e.g., Zhang & Darnell, Nat Biotech, 2011; Weyn-Vanhentenryck, Cell Rep. 2014). Building on this unprecedented resolution, his lab has developed innovative statistical models to better define the binding specificity of RBPs, which led to discoveries of novel binding modes of old RBPs under decades of investigations, with implications in development and cancer (e.g., Ustianenko, Mol Cell, 2018 (cover story); Feng, Mol Cell, 2019). Dr. Zhang also developed an integrative modeling strategy to define splicing-regulatory networks by combining multiple modalities of genomic data and evolutionary signatures (Zhang, Science 2010). The lab has leveraged these networks to elucidate RBPs driving molecular diversity underlying neurodevelopment (e.g., Weyn-Vanhentenryck, Nat Commun, 2018; Jacko, Neuron, 2018) and neuronal cell type diversity (Feng, PNAS, 2021).To approach the research goals, Dr. Zhang and his lab regularly use a variety of experimental and computational approaches and techniques, including CRISPR-based genome engineering, high-throughput screening, deep sequencing, probabilistic modeling and machine learning (e.g., Bayesian networks and deep learning). The lab uses both cell-based (e.g., mouse ESCs and human iPSCs and directed neuronal differentiation) and mouse models.

"Philippe J. Batut, PhD",Genetics and Development,"Vast expanses of our genome correspond to regulatory sequences that control the activity of our genes – a far greater proportion, in fact, than is devoted to protein-coding sequences themselves. Philippe Batut’s research aims to characterize these regulatory sequences and understand the molecular mechanisms by which they modulate gene expression during the development of a new organism.Philippe's graduate work contributed to the ENCODE Project’s efforts towards the functional annotation of the human genome, and to a growing realization that much of our genome is transcribed into long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). These lncRNAs are a diverse class of molecules that, despite resembling mRNAs, do not encode proteins – and while a small subset has been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression, their functions remain largely unexplored. Philippe used evolutionary transcriptomics approaches to show that many lncRNAs in the Drosophila genome are deeply conserved, suggesting that they are biologically relevant. Their expression is extremely dynamic during embryonic development, and these temporal dynamics are also highly conserved.In his postdoctoral research at Princeton University, he leveraged quantitative live imaging approaches to study the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in development in the group of Michael S. Levine. This work established, through the use of emerging genome engineering technologies, that the three-dimensional organization of the genome in the space of the nucleus plays a key role in regulating the temporal dynamics of gene expression. His work further paved the way for single-cell studies of the regulatory roles non-coding RNAs in developing embryos.Learn more about his research at theBatut Lab.",Developmental Genetics Epigenetics Functional Genomics Gene Regulation Genome Organization Microscopy and Imaging Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) Regulatory Sequences,"Batut PJ , Bing XY, Sisco Z, Raimundo J, Levo M, Levine MS (2022).

"Luke E. Berchowitz, PhD",Genetics and Development,"Sexually reproducing organisms employ a specialized developmental program to generate cells that are used to pass genetic material from one generation to the next. These reproductive cells, called gametes, contain half the DNA complement of a typical cell and are known to us as sperm, eggs, pollen, and spores etc. A hallmark feature of gamete development is a marked decrease in mRNA production (i.e. transcriptional control) and a concurrent emphasis on genetic regulation at the level of protein synthesis (i.e. translational control). We discovered that in order to control translation during gamete development, budding yeast builds massive RNA-binding protein structures that exhibit biochemical properties of amyloid (thus termed ‘amyloid-like’). Our research goals are to discover and understand the pathways and mechanisms by which cells regulate formation, function, and reversibility of amyloids. We strive to expand our understanding of birth defects and fertility while also providing key insights into principles underlying neurodegenerative disease.Amyloids are fibrous protein aggregates that are predominantly understood for their roles in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and prion diseases. What is remarkable about amyloid-like assemblies in yeast is that they are not pathogenic- on the contrary they are both functional and regulated. These structures bind to and repress translation of key transcripts and are essential for gamete production. Formation of these repressors is regulated by starvation and clearance is regulated by precise developmental cues. Regulated amyloid-like assemblies are also features of mouse and frog meiosis highlighting their evolutionary conservation and likely ancient evolutionary origin in sexual reproduction.Our lab employs genetic, cell biological, and biochemical approaches to understand the pathways and mechanisms underlying formation and clearance of amyloid-like assemblies. We also use a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to decipher how translation can be regulated by this intriguing class of RNA-binding structures. We are also using yeast to screen and identify compounds that prevent and/or disassemble amyloid-like assemblies. The compounds that we identify in this manner will be excellent potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative disease. Lastly, we are investigating the hypothesis that mammalian sperm development also relies on amyloid-like assemblies to regulate gene expression.Our studies will lay the foundation for understanding the molecular underpinnings of how cells regulate and process amyloid-like assemblies. Each finding provides the potential lead to a pathway or gene that could be a therapeutic target. Despite much research and development, anti-amyloid preventative therapies have been elusive. They are needed for neurodegenerative diseases in which few if any effective preventative therapies are currently available. Therapeutic strategies resulting from this work will rely on my ability to apply the findings we gain from this study to neurodegenerative disease models.

"Amanda L. Bergner, MS, LCGC",Genetics and Development,"Ms. Bergner’s research had been focused in several areas, including understanding the value of genetic testing for the epilepsies. The application of genetic testing in the setting of epilepsy has increased tremendously in the past decade, moving from single gene testing to multi-gene panels and broader genomic sequencing. Her research into the use of genetic testing in epilepsy and the value of genetic testing results in the management of epilepsy is helping to shape the national conversation on the importance of this tool in the treatment of individuals and families, including her involvement in conducting the systematic literature review that led to the first practice guideline for genetic testing in the epilepsies.Ms. Bergner has also focused her research on the growing awareness of critical aspects of conducting clinical genomics research. Genome sequencing is becoming commonplace in clinical research focused on discovering genetic contributions to both rare and common disease. Her research has helped to elucidate several important considerations when undertaking this type of research in the clinic, including consent best practices and the return of results to subjects/patients. This work has helped to shape the national conversation about integrating research-based genomic sequencing into existing clinical practices, ultimately supporting informed decision-making for individuals and families.As well, Ms. Bergner has focused on the improvement of key quality of life components for individuals with neurofibromatosis. The neurofibromatoses (NF) are a group of disorders that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Individuals living with NF typically experience functional impairments in multiple body systems, including hearing loss, vision loss, mobility issues, communication difficulties, stigma, social isolation, and mental health disorders. While current trials focus on medical and surgical interventions to improve functional impairments with quantifiable outcomes, less has been explored in terms of patient-reported data about both quality of life and outcomes of intervention for NF. As part of her post-graduate research, Ms. Bergner investigated this problem and found that patient report is a critical component of evaluating both the impact of the symptoms of NF and potential intervention. Patient report can be valuable in two primary areas in which clinical trials are currently underway: hearing loss, and pain/physical functioning.As well, her research has helped to identify the most effective patient-reported outcome measures to be used in clinical trials in NF through the Response Endpoints in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) consortium, a group of international experts in NF. Collectively, the results from my research has opened new directions for evaluating response in clinical trials for NF. She has additionally been involved in making practice recommendations for the genetic counseling profession regarding NF.",N/A,N/A,"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-bergner-22a6555/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Bergner%20AL, https://www.vagelos.columbia.edu/education/academic-programs/program-genetic-counseling, http://maps.google.com/?q=40.842195400000,-73.942995700000, http://maps.google.com/?q=40.841347600000,-73.942340800000, http://maps.google.com/?q=41.064541800000,-73.857619400000, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Bergner+AL, https://www.linkedin.com/company/columbia-university-medical-center/"
"Timothy H. Bestor, PhD",Genetics and Development,"Some mammalian promoters are inactive even when in the presence of all the factors necessary for their expression; imprinted genes and genes on the inactive X chromosomes are not expressed, even though the identical allele on the homologous chromosome may be expressed at high levels. The states of activity of such genes are subject to somatic inheritance. Genes subject to heritable silencing are said to be under epigenetic regulation. Most epigenetic regulation in mammals depends on the establishment and maintenance of genomic methylation patterns. Transcription of mammalian genes is prevented by the methylation of cytosines within promoter elements, and methylation patterns are transmitted during cell division with very high fidelity. It was previously thought that reversible promoter methylation might be involved in gene regulation during development, but recent data indicate that the primary function of DNA methylation is the suppression of intragenomic parasites and of proviral DNA. DNA methylation also has crucial roles in genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation in females. Our laboratory purified, characterized, and cloned the first eukaryotic DNA methyltransferase, now known as DNMT1. We collaborated with the Jaenisch laboratory to disrupt the Dnmt1 gene and showed that DNA methylation is necessary for the suppression of transposons; Jaenisch and colleagues showed that DNA methylation is required for imprinted gene expression and for X chromosome inactivation. Our laboratory was the first to identify a human genetic disorder (ICF syndrome) that is caused by mutations in a DNA methyltransferase gene (the DNMT3B gene), the first to identify a mammalian tRNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase, and the first to identify a gene required for the establishment of genomic imprints in oocytes and for the methylation and silencing of transposons in male germ cells. We continue to identify the cues that direct de novo DNA methylation to specific sequences in germ cells and to identify factors required for de novo methylation. We are also using ultrahigh throughput DNA sequencing to obtain whole-genome methylation profiles in order to identify regions of ectopic DNA methylation that may contribute to the development of breast cancer and psychiatric disorders.",N/A,"1.

My research focuses on the regulation of lung development, regeneration-repair and the impact of prenatal fetal exposures on adult pulmonary diseases. My lab has a long-standing interest in studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which lung epithelial progenitors give rise to the various specialized cell types, including  multiciliated, secretory  and neuroendocrine cells. Furthermore, we have a major interest in studying the mechanisms that control the organization and behavior of the lung stem cell compartment and how their failure contribute to abnormal repair and chronic pulmonary diseases. Over the past two decades our studies have revealed key roles for Fgf, Notch, retinoids, Hippo-Yap and microRNAs in the development of the lung structure, innate immunity and the diversity and function of the stem cell compartment of airways. Our work has provided relevant mechanistic insights into a number of conditons, including, lung agenesis and hypoplasia, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and neuroendocrine hyperplasias.","Airway epithelial differentiation and pathogenesis of chronic airway diseases Developmental basis of adult lung disease Developmental signaling in lung formation and diseases Formation and diversification of multiciliated cells in the respiratory system Lung development and repair-regeneration Ontogeny and regulation of the airway stem cell pool in the lung Progenitor/Stem cell biology SARS-COVID-2- host interactions in the lung Grants R35HL135834-05 (PI: Cardoso) 01/01/17 – 12/31/23 Mechanisms Controlling Expansion and Lineage Specification of Airway Progenitors in Development and Disease: This project is designed to study the mechanisms that control the organization and behavior of the stem cell compartment within the airways during development and to investigate the impact of disruption of these mechanisms in pulmonary disease pathogenesis.

"Chia-Wei Cheng, PhD",Genetics and Development,"Adaptation to dietary changes profoundly influenced human evolution and continues to impact our modern lives in health and diseases. After embryonic development, tissue-resident adult stem and progenitor cells remain the capacity to adjust their regenerative activity in response to diets and nutritional states to maintain tissue homeostasis. Such adaptation must rely on the systemic mediators integrating the inter-organ crosstalk to coordinate whole-body metabolism and the intracellular signaling machinery converting the nutritional messages into the transcriptional regulatory actions to determine the stem cell fate.Our research focuses on the interface of nutritional and transcriptional regulatory networks. We study how adult stem and progenitor cells perceive the nutritional states and fine-tune their lineage decisions in tissue regeneration and disease development processes. Our goal is to illustrate the conversion from the nutritional perception to cell fate decisions at the single-cell level, in the hope of inspiring new therapeutic strategies. Towards this end, we use genetic mouse models, organoid systems, and transplantation experiments to identify and characterize the endocrinal and metabolic cell-fate determinants in the contexts of tissue homeostasis and adaptation to diet.

"Christine Iok In Chio, PhD",Genetics and Development,"Christine Chio studies Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that represents the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Lethality of PDA owes largely to the advanced disease stage at the time of diagnosis and to its profound resistance to existing therapies. Targeted therapy is a cornerstone of precision medicine, and is currently the focus of much anticancer drug development. However, in the context of pancreatic cancer, no chemical inhibitors exist for the most common KRAS mutations (G12D, G12V) even though it is well established that the oncogenic KRAS promotes drug resistance. Thus, a detailed understanding of the role of specific genetic lesions and their signaling surrogates in the initiation and progression of PDA is critical to improving treatment efficacy and patient outcome for this disease. Using genetically engineered mouse models and ex vivo culture systems, the Chio lab seeks to understand the basic mechanisms underlying PDAC biology such that vulnerabilities can be identified and tested for therapeutic intervention.

"Henry Colecraft, PhD",Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"Structure-Function Mechanisms of CaV Channel β SubunitsVoltage-dependent calcium (CaV) channels are multi-subunit protein complexes comprised of a main pore-forming α1 subunit and associated accessory proteins. Of the accessory proteins, β subunits (CaVβ) are arguably the most important, being necessary for targeting the channel to the membrane and normalizing channel gating (the manner in which the channel opens and closes). Their essential role is emphasized by the severe neurological and cardiovascular phenotypes ensuing from CaVβ dysregulation: epilepsy, altered threshold to pain, night blindness, and defects in cardiac development.  We aim to understand: (1) at a quantitative level the mechanisms by which CaVβs exert such powerful effects on CaV channels; (2) the role of the α1-β interaction in disease; and (3) the potential of the α1-β association as a target for therapeutic drugs.  A powerful complement of approaches is used including: whole-cell and single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) determination of protein-protein interactions, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and modeling.Design of Novel Genetically-Encoded CaV Channel InhibitorsBlockade of CaV channels is a therapeutic strategy for an impressive array of cardiovascular and neurological diseases including: angina, hypertension, stroke, migraines, neuropathic pain, and epilepsy.  In the quest for more effective and selective CaV channel blockers, the CaV channel a1-b subunit interaction is recognized as a promising locus, although attempts to target this site in the past have met with only limited success.  It was recently discovered that the Rem/Rad/Gem/Kir (RGK) sub-family of Ras-like GTPases potently inhibit CaV channels by interaction with CaVb subunits.  How do these ‘natural genetically-encoded CaV channel blockers’ work?  Can we learn from Nature’s design to create a new generation of custom CaV channel blockers?  We are taking cues from this remarkable protein family to create useful new genetically encoded CaV channel blockers for various customized applications.Reverse Engineering CaV Channels in Heart and NeuronsCaV channels are central to biological function in heart and nerve cells, being necessary for generating the heartbeat, nerve cell communications, and regulation of gene expression.  In the complicated cellular environment of heart cells and neurons, the mechanistic bases of CaV channel functions are often obscure, akin to a biological ‘black box’.  To elucidate mysterious aspects of CaV channel behavior in such native cells we employ a reverse engineering approach where viral-mediated gene delivery permits selective genetic manipulation of CaV channel properties in heart and neuronal cells.  Questions we are interested in addressing include: How are different CaV channels targeted to spatially distinct sites in heart and neurons?  What mechanisms underlie CaV channel regulation by messenger molecules in heart and neurons?  To address these, we combine viral-mediated gene delivery, quantitative confocal imaging, and electrophysiological approaches.",Biophysics/Ion Channels Cellular/Molecular/Developmental Neuroscience,"Aromolaran, A., Chang, D., Kobertz, W.R., and Colecraft, H.M. 2014.

"Sabrina Diano, PhD",Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"Dr. Diano’s research focuses on brain mechanisms regulating energy and glucose homeostasis using interdisciplinary approaches, including molecular biology, anatomy, biochemistry, behavior, electrophysiology, and chemogenetics, in rodent models. Her studies on nutrient sensing by the brain aim to identify inter- and intra-cellular mechanisms that enable brain cells to regulate energy and glucose metabolism and how derangements of these mechanisms induce the development of metabolic disorders. Her research adds critical information to the current understanding of the central regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis and how alterations in stored energy are sensed in the brain.The results of her research have important implications for the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, disorders that are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S., and the developed world in general, with the highest financial burden on the national economy.As metabolic dysfunctions have been linked to other disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression, the focus of Dr. Diano’ research involves also studies aiming to decipher the role of metabolic dysfunction in the onset and development of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.",N/A,"Jin S, Yoon N, Liu ZW, Horvath TL, Kim J, Diano S.

"Qing R. Fan, PhD",Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"Our laboratory studies the molecular mechanisms by which class C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transmit signals across biological membranes. Class C GPCRs mediate a number of key biological phenomena including excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, calcium homeostasis, and taste. These receptors are characterized by a large ligand-binding extracellular domain in addition to the canonical seven-helix transmembrane domain. Another unique feature of the class C receptors is that they require dimerization for function. We are investigating the structure and function of two class C GPCRs, human GABA(B) receptor and calcium-sensing (CaS) receptor. Our goal is to understand the ligand-dependent activation mechanism of these receptors.Human GABA(B) receptor mediates inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. It functions as an obligatory heterodimer of GBR1 and GBR2 subunits. We determined the extracellular-domain structures of GABA(B) receptor in three functional states: in the apo form, bound to six different antagonists, and bound to two different agonists. Our structures revealed the molecular mechanisms of orthosteric ligand recognition and showed that receptor activation involves the formation of a novel heterodimer interface between membrane proximal-domains of both subunits.We recently solved a near full-length structure of GABA(B) receptor, captured in the inactive state by cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure revealed a novel heterodimer interface between the transmembrane (TM) helices 3 and 5 of both GABA(B) subunits. This interface embodies the signature of GABA(B) receptor’s inactive conformation. Furthermore, we identified a unique Â¢intersubunit latchÂ¢ motif within this TM interface that maintains the inactive state of the receptor. Its disruption through mutation results in constitutive receptor activity. We also discovered multiple ligands pre-associated with the receptor, including two large endogenous phospholipids embedded within the TM domains to modulate receptor function and maintain receptor integrity.Human CaS receptor maintains extracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis through the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion. We solved the crystal structures of the entire extracellular domain of CaS receptor in the resting and active conformations. We provided direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of the receptor. In the active structure, L-Trp occupies the orthosteric agonist-binding site at the interdomain cleft, and is primarily responsible for inducing extracellular domain closure to initiate receptor activation.Using anomalous difference maps, we identified multiple novel binding sites for Ca(2+) that are located throughout the extracellular domain. Ca(2+) fulfills two functional roles. First, it maintains the structural integrity of CaS receptor. Second, it is directly involved in receptor activation as it facilitates the formation of a homodimer interface that is unique to the active state. Our results indicate that amino acids and Ca(2+) are co-agonists of CaS receptor, acting jointly to trigger receptor activation.Our structures revealed multiple binding sites for PO4(3-). PO4(3-) is also important for structural integrity of the receptor, but it inhibits receptor activity. Therefore, activation of CaS receptor involves an intricate interplay of amino acids, Ca(2+), and PO4(3-).",Structural biology; cell surface receptor - ligand recognition,"1.

"Jonathan A. Javitch, MD, PhD",Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"One main line of research in my laboratory is aimed at understanding the structural bases of agonist and antagonist binding and specificity in the dopamine D2-like receptors and related biogenic amine receptor, how agonist binding is transduced into G protein activation, and the structural basis for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomerization and its role in signaling. In the pursuit of these objectives we are carrying out research on the dopamine D2 receptor as well as several other GPCRs. The D2 receptor is the principal target of antipsychotic drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia.Other research in my laboratory is focused on determining the structural bases of the transport of substrate by the dopamine transporter and its inhibition by drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine. We are also studying regulation of the trafficking and function of the dopamine transporter and its role in sensitization. Several lines of evidence support the relevance of sensitization to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, including the ability of amphetamine and other psychostimulants to induce psychosis in normal subjects and the increased sensitivity of patients with schizophrenia to the psychotogenic effects of psychostimulants.Our laboratory also studies a number of bacterial homologs of the neurotransmitter transporters as model systems for direct structural studies, including X-ray crystallography, EPR spectroscopy, and single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, which we are pursuing in collaboration with colleagues. Our work focuses primarily on the molecular and cellular level, and we also are using mice and fruit flies as model systems to probe the relevance of these molecular details to psychostimulant-induced behaviors.","Biophysics/Ion Channels G-protein Coupled Receptors: Structural Bases for Pharmacological Specificity and Function Models of Psychiatric Disorders Neurobiology of Disease Neurotransmitter Transporters: Biophysics, Biochemistry and Regulation","1: Asher WB, Geggier P, Holsey MD, Gilmore GT, Pati AK, Meszaros J, Terry DS, Mathiasen S, Kaliszewski MJ, McCauley MD, Govindaraju A, Zhou Z, Harikumar KG, Jaqaman K, Miller LJ, Smith AW, Blanchard SC, Javitch JA.

"Robert S. Kass, PhD",Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"The focus of Dr. Kass' research program is the structure and function of ion channels that are expressed primarily in the heart. Dr. Kass has directed NIH and/or NSF sponsored research for forty-two years that has contributed to our understanding of the fundamental cellular and molecular basis of cardiac electrical activity through a multidisciplinary approach bridging basic biophysical and clinical science. Contributions from this work include the cellular basis of calcium-dependent arrhythmogenic activity in the heart, basic mechanisms of action of calcium channel blocking drugs, and the molecular events underlying the control of the duration of electrical events in the heart during sympathetic nerve stimulation. His laboratory has focused on understanding the molecular physiology and pharmacology of congenital arrhythmias. These arrhythmias are caused by inherited mutations in genes coding for ion channels and/or ion channel related proteins expressed in the heart. This work has contributed to an understanding of gene-specific risk factors caused by mutation-induced changes in heart ion channel activity, and to the development of a mutation-specific approach to manage these disorders. The mutation-specific therapeutic strategy, verified in genotyped patients, has established the principle that two variants of the same genetic disorder require dramatically different therapeutic strategies for disease management based on biophysical properties of specific genetic lesions. This approach has evolved from close collaborations with clinical colleagues in which information is shared from clinic to basic laboratory and back to clinic. Additional studies are aimed at unraveling the structural basis of mutation-induced, and potentially lethal, disease phenotypes using approaches such as voltage-clamp fluorometry to directly measure movement of gating machinery in the ion channel of interest as well as biochemical methods of directly probing structures of region of ion channels that are hotspots for disease-causing mutations and the use of computer-based modeling to understand both structure and functional consequences of these mutations. Work has additionally more recently focused on potassium ion channel mutations that underlie a form of heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension. This work has provided information not only of novel pathways that contribute to this disease, but also to new routes of therapeutic management of this disorder. The goal of this approach is to unmask new and specific targets for the development of anti-arrhythmic drugs. Currently, work in the laboratory focused on the study of mechanisms underlying heritable arrhythmias in the context of complex genetic backgrounds has studied the cellular electrophysiology of cardiomyocytes differentiated from inducible pluripotent stem cells derived from family members of patients harboring disease-causing mutations. This approach has offered opportunities to screen drugs for effective disease management when multiple genes may be involved in the disease phenotype.",Biophysics/Ion Channels Cellular/Molecular/Developmental Neuroscience,"Cashman, J.R., et al., Antiarrhythmic Hit to Lead Refinement in a Dish Using Patient-Derived iPSC Cardiomyocytes.

"Steven Owen Marx, MD",Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"The Marx laboratory studies the regulation of ion channels by macromolecular complexes. We have demonstrated that specific sequences within the ion channel (leucine zippers) recruit regulatory proteins, which modulate the ion channel function in normal and pathologic conditions. The laboratory is now focused on understanding the molecular components and functional implications of macromolecular complex formation of the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa, maxi-K) and the L-type voltage gated calcium channel. The laboratory utilizes both molecular biologic and electrophysiologic (planar lipid bilayer, patch clamp) techniques to elucidate these fundamental processes and emphasizes the links between these fundamental molecular processes and systems function. To date our work has had significant impact in understanding the triggers of fatal cardiac arrhythmias and mechanical dysfunction in heart failure. Present experiments are very likely to impact our understanding of control of peripheral blood pressure by the sympathetic nervous system.","Molecular biology/macromolecular complex formation of ion channels For a complete list of publications, please visit PubMed.gov Columbia University Irving Medical Center NewYork-Presbyterian ColumbiaDoctors About Us Research Graduate Degree Program Contact Us Columbia University Irving Medical Center Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics 630 West 168th Street VP&S 7th Floor, Room 7-401 New York , NY 10032 United States Follow Us Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn © 2024 Columbia University Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions HIPAA General Information: 212-305-2862 Back to top",N/A,"https://www.pharmacology.cuimc.columbia.edu/about-us/message-chair, https://www.pharmacology.cuimc.columbia.edu/research/concepcion-lab, https://www.pharmacology.cuimc.columbia.edu/graduate-program/how-apply, http://maps.google.com/?q=40.841242600000,-73.940970600000, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Marx%20SO[Author]&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=23507255, https://www.columbiadoctors.org, https://www.linkedin.com/company/columbia-university-medical-center/"

"Steven A. Siegelbaum, PhD",Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"We are interested in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying electrical signaling and synaptic transmission in the nervous system, and how these electrical signals give rise to complex behaviors. We focus on how ion channels and synaptic transmission regulate information flow in the cortico-hippocampal circuit, which plays a critical role in learning and memory. One area of research explores the role of the hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (the HCN channels) in regulating dendritic integration of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. We found that genetic deletion of the HCN1 channel from hippocampus enhances synaptic excitation, the induction of long-term plasticity and, surprisingly, spatial learning and memory. As these channels have also been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric diseases, we are now examining the molecular mechanisms that regulate HCN1 channel expression and trafficking in both normal and disease states. A second project examines the role of the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus, an area first identified in 1934 but which has received little attention over the past 80 years. We have developed a mouse like that enables us to selectively inactivate CA2, which we find produces a very specific deficit in the encoding of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember a conspecific. We are now examining the CA2 neural circuitry in more detail to determine how this region participates in memory encoding. As data from individuals with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders suggest the presence of alterations in the CA2 region, we are using mouse models of neuropsychiatric disease to explore the possible role of altered CA2 function in the social endophenotypes of these disorders.",Biophysics/Ion Channels Models of Psychiatric Disorders Molecular Studies of Ion Channel Structure and Function Neurobiology of Learning and Memory Synapses and Circuits Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity in the Mammalian Brain,"Sun Q, Srinivas KV, Sotayo A, Siegelbaum SA.

"Susan F. Steinberg, MD",Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"The studies in my laboratory aim to identify the mechanisms that underlie the physiologically important changes in cardiomyocyte adrenergic receptor responsiveness that accompany normal cardiac development, that influence the evolution of heart failure, or that contribute to cardiac injury in the setting of ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative stress. Our studies take advantage of a wide range of reductionist molecular and cell biological approaches in both cell culture and in vitro models to study the expression and subcellular localization of adrenergic receptor subtypes, to identify the adrenergic receptor binding partners and effectors that dictate signaling specificity in cardiomyocytes, and to understand the molecular basis for catecholamine-dependent cardiomyocyte remodeling. One area of particular interest has been the stimulus- (in some cases redox-) dependent post-translational modifications on signaling kinases such as protein kinase C and protein kinase D that alter their enzymology. We also have identified post-translational processing (involving an O-glycan-regulated proteolytic cleavage) of the beta1-adrenergic receptor N-terminus as a mechanism that calibrates signaling output to downstream effector responses. In both cases, these studies identify novel molecular determinants that can serve as druggable targets.",N/A,"Steinberg SF.

"Dian Yang, PhD",Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"We are generally interested in investigating the fundamental principles of tumor evolution and identifying key regulators of tumor progression.  Our research is at the interface ofcancer biology,technology development,and computational analysis, which combines CRISPR-based molecular recording tools, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), single cell genomics-related algorithm development, and in vivo functional assays.The main goal of the Yang lab is to investigate the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms governing cancer cell state transitions and ultimately develop a quantitative roadmap of tumor evolution.Towards this goal,we have recently developed an autochthonous“KP-Tracer” mouse model, which allows us to continuously monitor the processes by which a single cell harboring oncogenic mutations evolves into an aggressive tumor. In collaboration with Nir Yosef's lab, we have developed anew computational algorithm""Cassiopeia""for building high-resolution tumor phylogenies. This offers a significant advance in tumor evolution modeling by enablingquantitative inference of fitness landscapes, cellular plasticity, evolutionary pathsof primary tumors and metastases, and the role of any gene of interest in altering all these facets of tumor development.Building upon these cutting-edge technologies, our lab aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of tumor evolution by integrating multiple data modalities. We will dissect the cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that govern cancer cell state transitions, and identify the regulatory gene networks that drive cancer evolution. Furthermore, our lab is committed to expanding the molecular recording toolkits, enabling more precise and detailed reconstruction of tumor life histories. Through these collaborative efforts, we strive to reconstruct the entire trajectory of tumor development, capturing the process from a single transformed cell to a complex and aggressive tumor population, with unprecedented scale and resolution. Ultimately, this holistic approach will pave the way for the development of predictive models of tumor evolution, advancing our ability to predict and potentially intervene in cancer progression.",Genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer development Mechanisms of tumor evolution Molecular recording technology development Single-cell genomics,"1.

"Yonghao Yu, PhD",Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"Our understanding of how the biology of various diseases relates to the central dogma that DNA encodes RNA, which encodes protein has been buoyed by rapid technological advances in DNA and RNA sequencing and has led to some of the first advances in personalized medicine. However, characterization of the final and arguably most actionable element of the central dogma, protein, has lagged behind. Among the various proteomic parameters, a comprehensive description of the landscape of covalent protein modifications in any given cell is particularly challenging. Our research efforts are highly multidisciplinary, which have been largely focused on two programs, i.e., (1) novel protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs), and (2) novel covalent protein modifications by small molecule drugs. Regarding (1), the entire repertoire of protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) is enormous, with ~400 different known types, and many more unknown ones (i.e., the “dark proteome”). PTMs are inaccessible by genomic sequencing tools. Instead, they are almost exclusively analyzed by proteomic technologies. The functional characterization of a PTM event ultimately depends on the unequivocal assignment of the modification site. However, the chemical natures of PTMs are diverse, and many types of PTMs are not amenable to traditional proteomic technologies for site-localization with single amino acid resolution because they are, for example, labile, heterogeneous or low-abundance. We have developed a multidisciplinary program (i.e., chemical biology, quantitative-/chemo-proteomics, computation biology, biochemistry, molecular biology and animal models) towards the functional analyses of a number of important PTMs, including protein tyrosine sulfation, phosphorylation and Poly-ADP-ribosylation. Regarding (2), besides these naturally occurring PTMs, covalent protein modification has been increasingly appreciated as a novel therapeutic modality. The current efforts on drug development have been mostly focused on targeting a small fraction of the human proteome with good pharmacological tractability (e.g., kinases). It has been estimated, however, that approximately 90% of human proteins (e.g., transcription factors, adaptors and intrinsically disordered proteins) have not been effectively targeted by small-molecule drugs, because, for example, they lack traditionally defined binding pockets. We have also been particularly active in the development of covalent protein modification and chemoproteomic technologies that potentially will revolutionize the principle of drug development by pushing the boundaries of the druggable proteome.",N/A,"Kim C, Wang XD, Liu Z, Zha S, Yu Y.

"Larry Abbott, PhD",Neuroscience,"Computational and Mathematical Analysis of Neurons and Neural NetworksLarry Abbott's research involves the computational modeling and mathematical analysis of neurons and neural networks. Analytic techniques and computer simulation are used to study how single neurons respond to their many synaptic inputs, how neurons interact to produce functioning neural circuits, and how large populations of neurons represent, store, and process information. Areas of particular interest include spike-timing dependent forms of synaptic plasticity, transformations of sensory encoding in olfaction, and the dynamics of internally generated activity and signal propagation in large neural networks.Most neural activity is generated internally but nervous systems are nevertheless highly sensitive to external influences such as sensory stimuli. We study how stimulus driven and internally generative activity interact and combine to produce responses. We also model how chaotic ongoing activity can be harnessed and controlled to produce useful motor output. We are interested in representing perception not as a passive analysis of sensory input, but as a dynamic process that involves modeling the external world, making inferences about predictable events and noting when something unexpected happens. This requires both representing sensory stimuli and modifying ongoing activity through synaptic plasticity.",Cognitive/Systems Neuroscience Computation and Theory Neurobiology of Learning and Memory Theoretical Neuroscience,"Stern M, Sompolinsky H, Abbott LF.

"Dmitriy Aronov, PhD",Neuroscience,"The ultimate goal of my lab is to understand the relationship between neuronal activity dynamics and the states of cognitive experience, like memories and thoughts. We focus on the hippocampal/entorhinal system, which is critically involved in the formation and retrieval of memories. Studies of this circuit have traditionally focused on navigation, uncovering a rich representation of spatial variables in the firing of its neurons. Yet, spatial location is only one component of memory. Beyond location, memories contain a mix of sensory, temporal, behavioral and emotional information. We are trying to understand how all these diverse types of information are encoded in the hippocampal/entorhinal system and bound together into a coherent representation.Rat virtual reality. In one line of research, we are developing and using rat virtual reality (VR) systems in order to obtain unprecedented experimental control of the animal’s sensory environment. VR allows rapid, closed-loop manipulations of the animal’s sensory and behavioral context, coupled with uninterrupted neural recordings and manipulations. We are beginning to understand how behaviorally relevant sensory information is organized in the activity of the hippocampal/entorhinal circuit. By training rats to perform sophisticated memory-guided tasks in VR, we also aim to understand how the states of activity in this circuit contribute to behaviors that require memory retrieval.Food caching by birds. In a parallel line of research, we will study how memories are processed during a fascinating and highly specialized behavior – the caching and subsequent retrieval of hidden food items by black-capped chickadees. Chickadees use their hippocampal formation to perform this memory-guided task. However, compared to its mammalian counterpart, the avian hippocampal system is anatomically simpler and more tractable on the circuit level. Using automated laboratory caching arenas inspired by VR, combined with miniaturized technologies for small birds, we plan to investigate neural representations of cache memories and the contributions of these representations to behavior.",Cognitive/Systems Neuroscience Neurobiology of Learning and Memory Neuroethology Systems and Circuits,"1.

"Richard Axel, MD",Neuroscience,"Mammals possess an olfactory system of inordinate discriminatory power. We are studying how the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception is accomplished. Our analysis of the patterns of expression of the odorant receptor genes, coupled with earlier electrophysiologic experiments have provided a logic for olfactory discrimination. Individual olfactory sensory neurons express only one of a thousand receptor genes. Neurons expressing a given receptor, although randomly distributed in domains in the epithelium, project their axons to a small number of topographically fixed loci or glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. These data support a model of olfactory coding in which discrimination of odor quality would result from the detection of specific spatial patterns of activity in the olfactory bulb.",Neurogenetics Sensory Physiology Synapses and Circuits,"2015 Gore F, Schwartz EC, Brangers BC, Aladi S, Stujenske JM, Likhtik E, Russo MJ, Gordon JA, Salzman CD, Axel R.

Light, odor, taste, sound and touch need to be properly encoded in the brain to allow them to understand their natural surrounding and adapt their behavior to survive and thrive. Light in particular is an essential cue for many diurnal animals: it is sensed in the eye by photoreceptors; highly specialized neurons that detect photons. How do neuronal circuits in the brain accurately interpret these photoreceptor signals to extract a variety of features of the visual scene, such as object shape, color, and depth of field? Using the fruit fly model system, we are teasing apart the neuronal circuits underlying two aspects of vision: motion detection and color discrimination. We use a variety of complementary techniques:in vivosingle cell patch-clamp recordings, two-photon activity-imaging, optogenetic as well as behavioral paradigms.

"Mark Churchland, PhD",Neuroscience,"The brain is not only a remarkable computational organ – capable of feats that stymie the best computers and robots – it is the seat of who we are and all we think.  Yet despite such romantic notions, modern systems neuroscience has principally asked how the brain transforms inputs into outputs.  This approach has deep historical roots – Descartes, Sherrington – and fabulous modern successes – Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel.  Yet the brain is clearly more than a glorified input-output device.  The neural networks within it do not just respond to external stimuli, they also generate their own activity.  A principal goal of my laboratory is to study the neural dynamics responsible for this ability.  In particular, I study how primary motor cortex generates the rich temporal patterns of neural activity that are responsible for moving the body.  My laboratory also focuses on translating basic science knowledge regarding dynamics into better ‘neural prostheses’: brain-machine interfacesthat directly translate neural activity into movement, thus bypassing an injured limb or spinal cord.",Cognitive/Systems Neuroscience Motor Systems Systems and Circuits Theoretical Neuroscience Grants NIH Grants A DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS APPROACH TO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS IN NEUROSCIENCE Project Dates: 30-SEPT-12 to 31-AUG-17,"Churchland MM.

"Aniruddha Das, PhD",Neuroscience,"Our lab is interested in cortical mechanisms of visual processing. We have two broad areas of research – understanding task-related anticipation in visual cortex, and analyzing the cortical basis of visual form processing. We are also actively involved in developing new recording and analysis techniques for these two research directions.Task-Related Anticipation in Visual CortexBy using a novel optical imaging technique developed by us for use in alert behaving monkeys, we recently discovered a robust anticipatory hemodynamic signal in primary visual cortex (V1). This signal is independent of visual stimulation or local neuronal activity. Given any regular, predictable visual task, this signal appears timed to bring fresh arterial blood to V1 in anticipation of the task onset. Our finding poses a serious challenge to the current understanding of fMRI which assumes that hemodynamic signals are uniformly predicted by underlying neural activity. It also likely indicates a novel task-related arousal mechanism in the brain – probably driven by distal neuromodulatory input – that prepares relevant cortical areas for upcoming task demands by bringing in fresh arterial blood in anticipation. A major focus of our lab, currently, is in understanding the neural basis and functional consequences of this signal. We are doing so with optical imaging and electrophysiology both in the alert monkey, and in an alert rat preparation that we are in the process of setting up.Cortical Basis of Visual Form ProcessingIt is now appreciated that even V1 has the sophisticated neural machinery to process reasonably complex visual items such as smooth contours, textures and surfaces. This is mediated through geometrically precise long-range connections within V1, combined with feedback from higher visual areas. Using optical imaging in alert monkey we find that the imaged response to a chain of short lines is suppressed relative to the linear sum of responses to individual lines, in a manner that is tuned for smoothness and collinearity; fMRI responses in human V1 are closely analogous. Similarly, illusory contours evoke robust imaging signals in monkey V1; linear discriminant analysis and fMRI shows an analogous response in humans. Combining human studies where we can ask our subjects complex perceptual questions with monkey optical imaging where we can carry out more invasive electrophysiology gives us a powerful tool to explore the cortical basis of early visual processing.Developing New Brain Imaging and Analysis TechniquesTo pursue any question in neuroscience I believe it is very important to be able to develop new techniques as and when the question demands it. Our discovery of the anticipatory hemodynamic signal in V1 came about only because we had developed a dual-wavelength imaging technique that images cortical blood volume and oxygenation simultaneously with electrode recordings in the alert monkey. This allowed us to circumvent the limitations of neuoimaging signals such as fMRI that cannot disambiguate changes in blood volume from oxygenation. We are currently developing a flavoprotein imaging system to visualize neural activity at a spatial scale appropriate for studying visual processing. We are also developing imaging in the alert rodent, including two-photon imaging, to understand the neural basis of task-related anticipation.",Brain Imaging Cognitive/Systems Neuroscience Sensory Physiology,"M.

"Jane Dodd, PhD",Neuroscience,"We are studying the molecular and cellular events that regulate the early development and organization of the central nervous system. After neuronal differentiation, axons extend towards their target cells within the central nervous system, navigating under the guidance of cues in the environment. To determine the nature of such cues and the mechanisms by which growth cones respond to them, we have analyzed the earliest axonal pathways in the developing spinal cord. Using in vitro assays in combination with antibodies and molecular markers that define cellular components of the developing spinal cord, we have identified several components of a guidance system that may contribute to the projection pattern of a subset of sensory relay neurons, the commissural neurons. Commissural neurons project circumferentially and ventrally away from the dorsal midline of the neural tube and towards and across the ventral midline of the spinal cord before turning to project towards higher spinal segments and supraspinal sites. Two groups of cells, located at the dorsal and ventral midlines and known as the roof plate and the floor plate, respectively, appear to act as sources of cues for commissural axons. The roof plate appears to direct initial axon extension away from the dorsal midline through the release of a diffusible chemorepellent, whereas the floor plate provides both contact-mediated and diffusible cues for commissural axon navigation towards and across the midline. We are currently trying to determine how roof plate- and floor plate-derived signals act to influence the direction of growth of commissural axons.The ventral midline of the neural tube consists of several subgroups of cells that differ, according to their position in the rostro-caudal axis, in the expression of cellular markers and signaling molecules. Throughout the axis, these cells appear to have multiple roles in the patterning of adjacent cell types and axons. To begin to study the mechanisms underlying cell identity within the neural tube we have therefore examined the development of the ventral midline cell groups. By analyzing changes in neural cell identity and pattern within neural tube explants, we have shown that axial mesodermal cells of the notochord and prechordal mesoderm provide inductive signals that initiate the differentiation of the ventral midline and patterning of neurons within the neural plate. Sonic hedgehog appears to mediate the induction of floor plate by notochord, but in rostral regions sonic hedgehog appears to act cooperatively with another signaling molecule to generate ventral midline cells with rostral properties. Current experiments are directed at the molecular identification of mesoderm-derived inducing signals at different rostro-caudal levels and the characterization of the response of neuroepithelial cells to such signals.",Axon Pathfinding and Synaptogenesis Cell Specification and Differentiation Cellular/Molecular/Developmental Neuroscience Synapses and Circuits,"Perron, J.

"Yasmine El-Shamayleh, PhD",Neuroscience,"Yasmine El-Shamayleh is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neuroscience and a Principal Investigator in the Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. She received a BA in Biological Basis of Behavior from the University of Pennsylvania, where she worked with Larry A. Palmer. She received a PhD in neural science from New York University, where she worked with Tony Movshon. She then completed two postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Washington, where she worked with Anitha Pasupathy and Gregory D. Horwitz. Yasmine joined Columbia University in May 2019.The overarching goal of research in the El-Shamayleh lab is to discover how neurons in the primate cerebral cortex identify the objects we see—a process critical for informing our decisions and guiding our actions. In pursuit of this goal, we seek to understand how visual cortical neurons process information about the shape of an object—information that enables us to identify objects correctly and to interact with them appropriately. To furnish new mechanistic insights, we use and develop optogenetic techniques for the functional dissection of primate cortical circuits.",Cognitive/Systems Neuroscience Sensory Physiology Synapses and Circuits,"De A, El-Shamayleh Y, Horwitz GD (2020).
