        "Abstract": "Neurogenesis lasts ~10 times longer in developing humans compared to mice, resulting in a >1,000-fold increase in the number of neurons in the CNS. To identify molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to this difference, we studied human and mouse motor neurogenesis using a stem cell differentiation system that recapitulates species-specific scales of development. Comparison of human and mouse single-cell gene expression data identified human-specific progenitors characterized by coexpression of NKX2-2 and OLIG2 that give rise to spinal motor neurons. Unlike classical OLIG2",

        "Abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Whereas young neurons are capable of buffering disease-causing stresses, mature neurons lose this ability and degenerate over time. We hypothesized that the resilience of young motor neurons could be restored by re-expression of the embryonic motor neuron selector transcription factors ISL1 and LHX3. We found that viral re-expression of ISL1 and LHX3 reactivates aspects of the youthful gene expression program in mature motor neurons and alleviates key disease-relevant phenotypes in the SOD1",

        "Abstract": "Neurons born in the embryo can undergo a protracted period of maturation lasting well into postnatal life. How gene expression changes are regulated during maturation and whether they can be recapitulated in cultured neurons remains poorly understood. Here, we show that mouse motor neurons exhibit pervasive changes in gene expression and accessibility of associated regulatory regions from embryonic till juvenile age. While motifs of selector transcription factors, ISL1 and LHX3, are enriched in nascent regulatory regions, motifs of NFI factors, activity-dependent factors, and hormone receptors become more prominent in maturation-dependent enhancers. Notably, stem cell-derived motor neurons recapitulate ~40% of the maturation expression program in vitro, with neural activity playing only a modest role as a late-stage modulator. Thus, the genetic maturation program consists of a core hardwired subprogram that is correctly executed in vitro and an extrinsically-controlled subprogram that is dependent on the in vivo context of the maturing organism.",

        "Abstract": "Proper assembly and function of the nervous system requires the generation of a uniquely diverse population of neurons expressing a cell-type-specific combination of effector genes that collectively define neuronal morphology, connectivity, and function. How countless partially overlapping but cell-type-specific patterns of gene expression are controlled at the genomic level remains poorly understood. Here we show that neuronal genes are associated with highly complex gene regulatory systems composed of independent cell-type- and cell-stage-specific regulatory elements that reside in expanded non-coding genomic domains. Mapping enhancer-promoter interactions revealed that motor neuron enhancers are broadly distributed across the large chromatin domains. This distributed regulatory architecture is not a unique property of motor neurons but is employed throughout the nervous system. The number of regulatory elements increased dramatically during the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates, suggesting that acquisition of new enhancers might be a fundamental process underlying the evolutionary increase in cellular complexity.",

        "Abstract": "Reliable and consistent pluripotent stem cell reporter systems for efficient purification and visualization of motor neurons are essential reagents for the study of normal motor neuron biology and for effective disease modeling. To overcome the inherent noisiness of transgene-based reporters, we developed a new series of human induced pluripotent stem cell lines by knocking in tdTomato, Cre, or CreERT2 recombinase into the HB9 (MNX1) or VACHT (SLC18A3) genomic loci. The new lines were validated by directed differentiation into spinal motor neurons and immunostaining for motor neuron markers HB9 and ISL1. To facilitate efficient purification of spinal motor neurons, we further engineered the VACHT-Cre cell line with a validated, conditional CD14-GFP construct that allows for both fluorescence-based identification of motor neurons, as well as magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to isolate differentiated motor neurons at scale. The targeting strategies developed here offer a standardized platform for reproducible comparison of motor neurons across independently derived pluripotent cell lines.",

        "Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease selectively targeting motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The reasons for differential motor neuron susceptibility remain elusive. We developed a stem cell-based motor neuron assay to study cell-autonomous mechanisms causing motor neuron degeneration, with implications for ALS. A small-molecule screen identified cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) as a stressor to which stem cell-derived motor neurons were more sensitive than interneurons. CPA induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response. Furthermore, CPA resulted in an accelerated degeneration of motor neurons expressing human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1) carrying the ALS-causing G93A mutation, compared to motor neurons expressing wild-type hSOD1. A secondary screen identified compounds that alleviated CPA-mediated motor neuron degeneration: three kinase inhibitors and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a bile acid derivative. The neuroprotective effects of these compounds were validated in human stem cell-derived motor neurons carrying a mutated SOD1 allele (hSOD1",

We demonstrate that V1 subtype diversity can be modified by extrinsic signals. Inhibition of Notch and activation of retinoid signaling results in a switch to MafA clade identity and enriches differentiation of Renshaw cells, a specialized MafA subtype that mediates recurrent inhibition of spinal motor neurons. We show that Renshaw cells are intrinsically programmed to migrate to species-specific laminae upon transplantation and to form subtype-specific synapses with motor neurons. Our results demonstrate that stem cell-derived neuronal subtypes can be used to investigate mechanisms underlying neuronal subtype specification and circuit assembly.",

        "Abstract": "Generic spinal motor neuron identity is established by cooperative binding of programming transcription factors (TFs), Isl1 and Lhx3, to motor-neuron-specific enhancers. How expression of effector genes is maintained following downregulation of programming TFs in maturing neurons remains unknown. High-resolution exonuclease (ChIP-exo) mapping revealed that the majority of enhancers established by programming TFs are rapidly deactivated following Lhx3 downregulation in stem-cell-derived hypaxial motor neurons. Isl1 is released from nascent motor neuron enhancers and recruited to new enhancers bound by clusters of Onecut1 in maturing neurons. Synthetic enhancer reporter assays revealed that Isl1 operates as an integrator factor, translating the density of Lhx3 or Onecut1 binding sites into transient enhancer activity. Importantly, independent Isl1/Lhx3- and Isl1/Onecut1-bound enhancers contribute to sustained expression of motor neuron effector genes, demonstrating that outwardly stable expression of terminal effector genes in postmitotic neurons is controlled by a dynamic relay of stage-specific enhancers.",

Here, we examine whether progenitors found in this domain are multipotent and which signals contribute to their cell-type-specific differentiation. Using an in vitro neural differentiation model, we demonstrate that motor neuron progenitor differentiation is iteratively controlled by Notch signaling. First, Notch controls the timing of motor neuron genesis by repressing Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) and maintaining Olig2-positive progenitors in a proliferative state. Second, in an Ngn2-independent manner, Notch contributes to the specification of median versus hypaxial motor column identity and lateral versus medial divisional identity of limb-innervating motor neurons. Thus, motor neuron progenitors are multipotent, and their diversification is controlled by Notch signaling that iteratively increases cellular diversity arising from a single neural progenitor domain.",

        "Title": "Kelch Domain of Gigaxonin Interacts with Intermediate Filament Proteins Affected in Giant Axonal Neuropathy.",
        "Abstract": "Patients with giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) show progressive loss of motor and sensory function starting in childhood and typically live for less than 30 years. GAN is caused by autosomal recessive mutations leading to low levels of gigaxonin (GIG), a ubiquitously-expressed BTB/Kelch cytoplasmic protein believed to be an E3 ligase substrate adaptor. GAN pathology is characterized by aggregates of intermediate filaments (IFs) in multiple tissues. To delineate the molecular pathway between GIG deficiency and IF pathology, we undertook a proteomic screen to identify the normal binding partners of GIG. Prominent among them were several classes of IFs, including the neurofilament subunits whose accumulation leads to the axonal swellings for which GAN is named. We showed these interactions were dependent on the Kelch domain of GIG. Furthermore, we identified the E3 ligase MYCBP2 and the heat shock proteins HSP90AA1/AB1 as interactors with the BTB domain that may result in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of intermediate filaments. Our open-ended proteomic screen provides support to GIG's role as an adaptor protein, linking IF proteins through its Kelch domain to the ubiquitin pathway proteins via its BTB domain, and points to future approaches for reversing the phenotype in human patients.",

        "Title": "Intermediate filament protein accumulation in motor neurons derived from giant axonal neuropathy iPSCs rescued by restoration of gigaxonin.",
        "Abstract": "Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the GAN gene resulting in a loss of a ubiquitously expressed protein, gigaxonin. Gene replacement therapy is a promising strategy for treatment of the disease; however, the effectiveness and safety of gigaxonin reintroduction have not been tested in human GAN nerve cells. Here we report the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from three GAN patients with different GAN mutations. Motor neurons differentiated from GAN iPSCs exhibit accumulation of neurofilament (NF-L) and peripherin (PRPH) protein and formation of PRPH aggregates, the key pathological phenotypes observed in patients. Introduction of gigaxonin either using a lentiviral vector or as a stable transgene resulted in normalization of NEFL and PRPH levels in GAN neurons and disappearance of PRPH aggregates. Importantly, overexpression of gigaxonin had no adverse effect on survival of GAN neurons, supporting the feasibility of gene replacement therapy. Our findings demonstrate that GAN iPSCs provide a novel model for studying human GAN neuropathologies and for the development and testing of new therapies in relevant cell types.",

As such, stem cell biology is emerging as a driving force behind many studies in regenerative medicine. This review focuses on the current understanding of the applications of stem cells in treating ailments of the human brain, with an emphasis on neurodegenerative diseases. Two types of neural stem cells are discussed: endogenous neural stem cells residing within the adult brain and pluripotent stem cells capable of forming neural cells in culture. Endogenous neural stem cells give rise to neurons throughout life, but they are restricted to specialized regions in the brain. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating these cells is key in determining their therapeutic potential as well as finding mechanisms to activate dormant stem cells outside these specialized microdomains. In parallel, patient-derived stem cells can be used to generate neural cells in culture, providing new tools for disease modeling, drug testing, and cell-based therapies. Turning these technologies into viable treatments will require the integration of basic science with clinical skills in rehabilitation.",

        "Abstract": "Hox genes controlling motor neuron subtype identity are expressed in rostrocaudal patterns that are spatially and temporally collinear with their chromosomal organization. Here we demonstrate that Hox chromatin is subdivided into discrete domains that are controlled by rostrocaudal patterning signals that trigger rapid, domain-wide clearance of repressive histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) polycomb modifications. Treatment of differentiating mouse neural progenitors with retinoic acid leads to activation and binding of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) to the Hox1-Hox5 chromatin domains, which is followed by a rapid domain-wide removal of H3K27me3 and acquisition of cervical spinal identity. Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals induce expression of the Cdx2 transcription factor that binds and clears H3K27me3 from the Hox1-Hox9 chromatin domains, leading to specification of brachial or thoracic spinal identity. We propose that rapid clearance of repressive modifications in response to transient patterning signals encodes global rostrocaudal neural identity and that maintenance of these chromatin domains ensures the transmission of positional identity to postmitotic motor neurons later in development.",

        "Abstract": "Efficient transcriptional programming promises to open new frontiers in regenerative medicine. However, mechanisms by which programming factors transform cell fate are unknown, preventing more rational selection of factors to generate desirable cell types. Three transcription factors, Ngn2, Isl1 and Lhx3, were sufficient to program rapidly and efficiently spinal motor neuron identity when expressed in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells. Replacement of Lhx3 by Phox2a led to specification of cranial, rather than spinal, motor neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis of Isl1, Lhx3 and Phox2a binding sites revealed that the two cell fates were programmed by the recruitment of Isl1-Lhx3 and Isl1-Phox2a complexes to distinct genomic locations characterized by a unique grammar of homeodomain binding motifs. Our findings suggest that synergistic interactions among transcription factors determine the specificity of their recruitment to cell type-specific binding sites and illustrate how a single transcription factor can be repurposed to program different cell types.",

        "Abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells are a promising source of differentiated cells for developmental studies, cell transplantation, disease modeling, and drug testing. However, their widespread use even for intensely studied cell types like spinal motor neurons is hindered by the long duration and low yields of existing protocols for in vitro differentiation and by the molecular heterogeneity of the populations generated. We report a combination of small molecules that within 3 weeks induce motor neurons at up to 50% abundance and with defined subtype identities of relevance to neurodegenerative disease. Despite their accelerated differentiation, motor neurons expressed combinations of HB9, ISL1, and column-specific markers that mirror those observed in vivo in human embryonic spinal cord. They also exhibited spontaneous and induced activity, and projected axons toward muscles when grafted into developing chick spinal cord. Strikingly, this novel protocol preferentially generates motor neurons expressing markers of limb-innervating lateral motor column motor neurons (FOXP1(+)/LHX3(-)). Access to high-yield cultures of human limb-innervating motor neuron subtypes will facilitate in-depth study of motor neuron subtype-specific properties, disease modeling, and development of large-scale cell-based screening assays.",

        "Abstract": "Diversification of mammalian spinal motor neurons into hundreds of subtypes is critical for the maintenance of body posture and coordination of complex movements. Motor neuron differentiation is controlled by extrinsic signals that regulate intrinsic genetic programs specifying and consolidating motor neuron subtype identity. While transcription factors have been recognized as principal regulators of the intrinsic program, the role of posttranscriptional regulations has not been systematically tested. MicroRNAs produced by Dicer mediated cleavage of RNA hairpins contribute to gene regulation by posttranscriptional silencing. Here we used Olig2-cre conditional deletion of Dicer gene in motor neuron progenitors to examine effects of miRNA biogenesis disruption on postmitotic spinal motor neurons. We report that despite the initial increase in the number of motor neuron progenitors, disruption of Dicer function results in a loss of many limb- and sympathetic ganglia-innervating spinal motor neurons. Furthermore, it leads to defects in motor pool identity specification. Thus, our results indicate that miRNAs are an integral part of the genetic program controlling motor neuron survival and acquisition of subtype specific properties.",

        "Abstract": "Formation of functional motor circuits relies on the ability of distinct spinal motor neuron subtypes to project their axons with high precision to appropriate muscle targets. While guidance cues contributing to motor axon pathfinding have been identified, the intracellular pathways underlying subtype-specific responses to these cues remain poorly understood. In particular, it remains controversial whether responses to axon guidance cues depend on axonal protein synthesis. Using a growth cone collapse assay, we demonstrate that mouse embryonic stem cell-derived spinal motor neurons (ES-MNs) respond to ephrin-A5, Sema3f, and Sema3a in a concentration-dependent manner. At low doses, ES-MNs exhibit segmental or subtype-specific responses, while this selectivity is lost at higher concentrations. Response to high doses of semaphorins and to all doses of ephrin-A5 is protein synthesis independent. In contrast, using microfluidic devices and stripe assays, we show that growth cone collapse and guidance at low concentrations of semaphorins rely on local protein synthesis in the axonal compartment. Similar bimodal response to low and high concentrations of guidance cues is observed in human ES-MNs, pointing to a general mechanism by which neurons increase their repertoire of responses to the limited set of guidance cues involved in neural circuit formation.",

        "Abstract": "Neural patterning relies on transcriptional cross-repressive interactions that ensure unequivocal assignment of neural progenitor identity to proliferating cells. Progenitors of spinal motor neurons (pMN) and V2 interneurons (p2) are specified by a pair of cross-repressive transcription factors, Olig2 and Irx3. Lineage tracing revealed that many p2 progenitors transiently express the pMN marker Olig2 during spinal cord development. Here we demonstrate that the repression of Olig2 in p2 domain is controlled by mir-17-3p microRNA-mediated silencing of Olig2 mRNA. Mice lacking all microRNAs or just the mir-17∼92 cluster manifest a dorsal shift in pMN/p2 boundary and impairment in the production of V2 interneurons. Our findings suggest that microRNA-mediated repression of Olig2 mRNA plays a critical role during the patterning of ventral spinal progenitor domains by shifting the balance of cross-repressive interactions between Olig2 and Irx3 transcription factors.",

        "Abstract": "Richness of neural circuits and specificity of neuronal connectivity depend on the diversification of nerve cells into functionally and molecularly distinct subtypes. Although efficient methods for directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into multiple principal neuronal classes have been established, only a few studies systematically examined the subtype diversity of in vitro derived nerve cells. Here we review evidence based on molecular and in vivo transplantation studies that ESC-derived spinal motor neurons and cortical layer V pyramidal neurons acquire subtype specific functional properties. We discuss similarities and differences in the role of cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs, extrinsic signals and cell-cell interactions during subtype diversification of the two classes of nerve cells. We conclude that the high degree of fidelity with which differentiating ESCs recapitulate normal embryonic development provides a unique opportunity to explore developmental processes underlying specification of mammalian neuronal diversity in a simplified and experimentally accessible system.",

        "Abstract": "Cultured ESCs can form different classes of neurons, but whether these neurons can acquire specialized subtype features typical of neurons in vivo remains unclear. We show here that mouse ESCs can be directed to form highly specific motor neuron subtypes in the absence of added factors, through a differentiation program that relies on endogenous Wnts, FGFs, and Hh-mimicking the normal program of motor neuron subtype differentiation. Molecular markers that characterize motor neuron subtypes anticipate the functional properties of these neurons in vivo: ESC-derived motor neurons grafted isochronically into chick spinal cord settle in appropriate columnar domains and select axonal trajectories with a fidelity that matches that of their in vivo generated counterparts. ESC-derived motor neurons can therefore be programmed in a predictive manner to acquire molecular and functional properties that characterize one of the many dozens of specialized motor neuron subtypes that exist in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases represent a growing public health challenge. Current medications treat symptoms, but none halt or retard neurodegeneration. The recent advent of pluripotent cell biology has opened new avenues for neurodegenerative disease research. The greatest potential for induced pluripotent cells derived from affected individuals is likely to be their utility for modeling and understanding the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative processes, and for searching for new treatments, including cell replacement therapies. However, much work remains to be done before pluripotent cells can be used for preclinical and clinical applications. Here we discuss the challenges of generating specific neural cell subtypes from pluripotent stem cells, the use of pluripotent stem cells to model both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration, whether adult-onset neurodegeneration can be emulated in short-term cultures and the hurdles of cell replacement therapy. Progress in these four areas will substantially accelerate effective application of pluripotent stem cells.",

        "Abstract": "Assembly of functional neural circuits relies on the ability of axons to navigate a complex landscape of guidance cues in the extracellular environment. In this report, we investigate localized cell signaling in response to these cues by combining a microfabricated compartmentalization chamber with multicomponent, protein-micropatterned surfaces; this system offers improved spatial resolution and new capabilities for targeted manipulation of neuronal axons. We illustrate the potential of this system by addressing the role of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling in modulating axon guidance by N-cadherin. Motor neurons that were derived from embryonic stem cells extend axons from one compartment through a microchannel barrier and into a second compartment containing patterns of N-cadherin, against a background of laminin. N-cadherin was effective in both guiding and accelerating motor axon outgrowth. Using the chamber system to target the application of pharmacological agents to specific parts of the neuron, we demonstrate that FGFR signaling in the axon but not the cell body increases the rate of axon outgrowth while not affecting guidance along N-cadherin. These results demonstrate that cell signaling must take into account the spatial layout of the cell. This new platform provides a powerful tool for understanding such effects over a wide range of signaling systems.",

In vitro generated cells need to be extensively characterized to establish functional equivalency with their in vivo counterparts. The ultimate test for the ability of ES cell-derived neurons to functionally integrate into neural networks is transplantation into the developing central nervous system, a challenging technique limited by the poor accessibility of mammalian embryos. Here we describe xenotransplantation of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived motor neurons into the developing chick neural tube as an alternative for testing the ability of in vitro generated neurons to survive, integrate, extend axons, and form appropriate synaptic contacts with functionally relevant targets in vivo. Similar methods can be adapted to study functionality of other mammalian cells, including derivatives of human ES cells.",

This unit describes one of the most efficient protocols for conversion of mouse ES cells into a defined type of nerve cells, the spinal motor neurons. ES cells are separated from feeder mouse embryonic fibroblasts and aggregated to form embryoid bodies (EBs). Two days after the withdrawal of growth factors, EBs reach a stage at which they are responsive to patterning signals and can be effectively induced with retinoic acid (RA) to differentiate into spinal nerve cells. Nascent neural cells become responsive to the ventralizing signal sonic hedgehog (Hh) that controls expression of ventral spinal progenitor markers and initiates the genetic program of motor neuron differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "The capacity of embryonic stem (ES) cells to form functional motoneurons (MNs) and appropriate connections with muscle was investigated in vitro. ES cells were obtained from a transgenic mouse line in which the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) is expressed under the control of the promotor of the MN specific homeobox gene Hb9. ES cells were exposed to retinoic acid (RA) and sonic hedgehog agonist (Hh-Ag1.3) to stimulate differentiation into MNs marked by expression of eGFP and the cholinergic transmitter synthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from eGFP-labeled cells to investigate the development of functional characteristics of MNs. In voltage-clamp mode, currents, including EPSCs, were recorded in response to exogenous applications of GABA, glycine, and glutamate. EGFP-labeled neurons also express voltage-activated ion channels including fast-inactivating Na(+) channels, delayed rectifier and I(A)-type K(+) channels, and Ca(2+) channels. Current-clamp recordings demonstrated that eGFP-positive neurons generate repetitive trains of action potentials and that l-type Ca(2+) channels mediate sustained depolarizations. When cocultured with a muscle cell line, clustering of acetylcholine receptors on muscle fibers adjacent to developing axons was seen. Intracellular recordings of muscle fibers adjacent to eGFP-positive axons revealed endplate potentials that increased in amplitude and frequency after glutamate application and were sensitive to TTX and curare. In summary, our findings demonstrate that MNs derived from ES cells develop appropriate transmitter receptors, intrinsic properties necessary for appropriate patterns of action potential firing and functional synapses with muscle fibers.",

        "Title": "A requirement for retinoic acid-mediated transcriptional activation in ventral neural patterning and motor neuron specification.",
        "Abstract": "The specification of neuronal fates in the ventral spinal cord depends on the regulation of homeodomain (HD) and basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins by Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Most of these transcription factors function as repressors, leaving unresolved the link between inductive signaling pathways and transcriptional activators involved in ventral neuronal specification. We show here that retinoid signaling and the activator functions of retinoid receptors are required to pattern the expression of HD and bHLH proteins and to specify motor neuron identity. We also show that fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) repress progenitor HD protein expression, implying that evasion of FGF signaling and exposure to retinoid and Shh signals are obligate steps in the emergence of ventral neural pattern. Moreover, joint exposure of neural progenitors to retinoids and FGFs suffices to induce motor neuron differentiation in a Shh-independent manner.",

        "Abstract": "Young neurons born in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) migrate a long distance dorsally, giving rise to several types of interneurons in neocortex. The mechanisms that facilitate selective dorsal dispersion of MGE cells while restricting their movement ventrally into neighboring regions are not known. Using microtransplantation into fetal brain slices and onto dissociated substrate cells on floating filters (spot assay), we demonstrate that ventral forebrain regions neighboring the MGE are nonpermissive for MGE cell migration, whereas the dorsal regions leading to the neocortex are increasingly permissive. Spot assay experiments using filters with different pore sizes indicate that the permissive factors are not diffusible. We also show that MGE cells respond to chemoattractive and inhibitory factors diffusing from the neocortex and ventromedial forebrain, respectively. We propose that the final extent and regional specificity of MGE cell dispersion is largely dictated by contact guidance through a selectively permissive environment, flanked by nonpermissive tissues. In addition, we propose that chemotactic guidance cues superimposed over the permissive corridor facilitate efficient dorsal migration of MGE cells.",

        "Abstract": "Inductive signals and transcription factors involved in motor neuron generation have been identified, raising the question of whether these developmental insights can be used to direct stem cells to a motor neuron fate. We show that developmentally relevant signaling factors can induce mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to differentiate into spinal progenitor cells, and subsequently into motor neurons, through a pathway recapitulating that used in vivo. ES cell-derived motor neurons can populate the embryonic spinal cord, extend axons, and form synapses with target muscles. Thus, inductive signals involved in normal pathways of neurogenesis can direct ES cells to form specific classes of CNS neurons.",
