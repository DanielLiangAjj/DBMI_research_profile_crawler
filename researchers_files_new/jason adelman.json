        "Abstract": "Studying near-miss errors is essential to preventing errors from reaching patients. When an error is committed, it may be intercepted (near-miss) or it will reach the patient; estimates of the proportion that reach the patient vary widely. To better understand this relationship, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using two objective measures to identify wrong-patient imaging order errors involving radiation, estimating the proportion of errors that are intercepted and those that reach the patient. This study was conducted at a large integrated healthcare system using data from 1 January to 31 December 2019. The study used two outcome measures of wrong-patient orders: (1) wrong-patient orders that led to misadministration of radiation reported to the New York Patient Occurrence Reporting and Tracking System (NYPORTS) (misadministration events); and (2) wrong-patient orders identified by the Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder (RAR) measure, a measure identifying orders placed for a patient, retracted and rapidly reordered by the same clinician on a different patient (near-miss events). All imaging orders that involved radiation were extracted retrospectively from the healthcare system data warehouse. Among 293 039 total eligible orders, 151 were wrong-patient orders (3 misadministration events, 148 near-miss events), for an overall rate of 51.5 per 100 000 imaging orders involving radiation placed on the wrong patient. Of all wrong-patient imaging order errors, 2% reached the patient, translating to 50 near-miss events for every 1 error that reached the patient. This proportion provides a more accurate and reliable estimate and reinforces the utility of systematic measure of near-miss errors as an outcome for preventative interventions.",

        "Abstract": "A prior randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed no significant difference in wrong-patient errors between clinicians assigned to a restricted electronic health record (EHR) configuration (limiting to 1 record open at a time) versus an unrestricted EHR configuration (allowing up to 4 records open concurrently). However, it is unknown whether an unrestricted EHR configuration is more efficient. This substudy of the RCT compared clinician efficiency between EHR configurations using objective measures. All clinicians who logged onto the EHR during the substudy period were included. The primary outcome measure of efficiency was total active minutes per day. Counts were extracted from audit log data, and mixed-effects negative binomial regression was performed to determine differences between randomized groups. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Among a total of 2556 clinicians, there was no significant difference between unrestricted and restricted groups in total active minutes per day (115.1 vs 113.3 min, respectively; IRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93-1.06), overall or by clinician type and practice area.",

The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology Patient Identification SAFER Guide recommends displaying patient photographs in electronic health record (EHR) systems to facilitate patient identification and reduce wrong-patient errors. A potential barrier to implementation is patient refusal; however, patients' perceptions about having their photograph captured during registration and integrated into the EHR are unknown.",

To reduce this risk, The Joint Commission requires hospitals to use a distinct identification method for newborns. Most hospitals create medical records for newborns at birth using temporary naming conventions, resulting in patients with similar identifiers. Typically, multiple-birth infants are distinguished from their siblings by a single character (1, 2, or A, B), placing them at higher risk for identification errors, which can delay care and compromise patient safety.",

        "Abstract": "Because maternal morbidity and mortality remain persistent challenges to the U.S. health care system, efforts to improve inpatient patient safety are critical. One important aspect of ensuring patient safety is reducing medical errors. However, obstetrics presents a uniquely challenging environment for safe ordering practices. When mother-newborn pairs are admitted in the postpartum setting with nearly identical names in the medical record (for example, Jane Doe and Janegirl Doe), there is a potential for wrong-patient medication ordering errors. This can lead to harm from the wrong patient receiving a medication or diagnostic test, especially a newborn receiving an adult dose of medication, as well as delaying treatment for the appropriate patient. We describe two clinical scenarios of wrong-patient ordering errors between mother-newborn pairs. The first involves an intravenous labetalol order that was placed for a postpartum patient but was released from the automated dispensing cabinet under the newborn's name. The medication was administered correctly, but an automatic order for labetalol was generated in the neonate's chart. Another scenario involves a woman presenting in labor with acute psychotic symptoms. The psychiatry service placed a note and orders for antipsychotic medications in the neonate's chart. These orders were cancelled shortly thereafter and replaced for the mother. These scenarios illustrate this specific patient-safety concern inherent in the treatment of mother-newborn pairs and highlight that perinatal units should evaluate threats to patient safety embedded in the unique mother-newborn relationship and develop strategies to reduce risk.",

        "Abstract": "A byproduct of the transition to electronic health records (EHRs) is the associated observational data that capture EHR users' granular interactions with the medical record. Often referred to as audit log data or event log data, these datasets capture and timestamp user activity while they are logged in to the EHR. These data - alone and in combination with other datasets - offer a new source of insights, which cannot be gleaned from claims data or clinical data, to support health services research and those studying healthcare processes and outcomes. In this commentary, we seek to promote broader awareness of EHR audit log data and to stimulate their use in many contexts. We do so by describing EHR audit log data and offering a framework for their potential uses in quality domains (as defined by the National Academy of Medicine). The framework is illustrated with select examples in the safety and efficiency domains, along with their accompanying methodologies, which serve as a proof of concept. This article also discusses insights and challenges from working with EHR audit log data. Ensuring that researchers are aware of such data, and the new opportunities they offer, is one way to assure that our healthcare system benefits from the digital revolution.",

        "Abstract": "Patient falls are a major problem in hospitals. The development of a Patient-Centered Fall Prevention Toolkit, Fall TIPS (Tailoring Interventions for Patient Safety), reduced falls by 25% in acute care hospitals by leveraging health information technology to complete the 3-step fall prevention process-(1) conduct fall risk assessments; (2) develop tailored fall prevention plans with the evidence-based interventions; and (3) consistently implement the plan. We learned that Fall TIPS was most effective when patients and family were engaged in all 3 steps of the fall prevention process. Over the past decade, our team developed 3 Fall TIPS modalities-the original electronic health record (EHR) version, a laminated paper version that uses color to provide clinical decision support linking patient-specific risk factors to the interventions, and a bedside display version that automatically populates the bedside monitor with the patients' fall prevention plan based on the clinical documentation in the EHR. However, the relative effectiveness of each Fall TIPS modality for engaging patients and family in the 3-step fall prevention process remains unknown.",

        "Abstract": "Falls are a serious, persistent problem in hospitals. Ensuring that all hospital staff have adequate knowledge of how to prevent falls is the first step in prevention. We identified validated fall prevention knowledge tests (FPKTs) and planned to conduct a systematic literature review. When the review identified a lack of FPKTs, we developed and evaluated a FPKT, confirmed its conceptual framework, identified the content domain, drafted test items, devised the format, selected items for empirical examination, and conducted a psychometric evaluation. We randomly divided a 209-subject data set into test and validation samples to make item reduction decisions and examine reliability and validity. The typical respondent was a white, 42-year old female nurse with a bachelor's degree and 7 years' experience. Subjects were confident in their ability to prevent falls, rating themselves an 8 on a self-efficacy scale of 1 (not at all) to 10 (very). The 11-item FPKT scale (range 0-11) attained a tetrachoric coefficient of 0.73, confirming initial reliability. FPKT mean scores obtained before and after fall prevention education improved from 5.1 ± 1.8 to 6.6 ± 1.7. Statistically significant differences (paired t-test = 12.4, p < .001) confirmed validity. A robust way to assess nurses' knowledge of fall prevention is needed to inform effective educational programs. Addressing gaps in validated FPKTs provides an opportunity to inform and evaluate effective fall prevention programs. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:133-138, 2019.",

However, it is unknown whether health care organizations follow this recommendation or what rationales drive their decisions. To address this gap, we conducted an electronic survey via 2 national listservs. Among 167 inpatient and outpatient study facilities using EHR systems designed to open multiple records at once, 44.3% were configured to allow ≥3 records open at once (unrestricted), 38.3% allowed only 1 record open (restricted), and 17.4% allowed 2 records open (hedged). Decision-making centered on efforts to balance safety and efficiency, but there was disagreement among organizations about how to achieve that balance. Results demonstrate no consensus on the number of records to be allowed open at once in EHRs. Rigorous studies are needed to determine the optimal number of records that balances safety and efficiency.",
