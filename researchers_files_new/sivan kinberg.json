        "Abstract": "As the majority of children with short bowel syndrome (SBS) and intestinal failure (IF) are now surviving into adulthood, there is a paradigm shift from short-term management to long-term outcomes and a growing need to focus on healthcare transition (HCT). It is imperative that adolescents and young adults with SBS and IF receive disease education, empowerment, and support as they navigate the transition from pediatric to adult care. Furthermore, both pediatric and adult healthcare providers who manage these patients should be aware of the challenges faced by this population, barriers to their HCT, and strategies to overcome them. This article reviews the literature on HCT in children with chronic illnesses, discusses barriers to HCT in SBS/IF, identifies the important constituents of the transition process in SBS/IF, and provides recommendations for the successful and smooth transition of the pediatric patient to the adult healthcare environment. Structured and multicomponent HCT programs should become the standard of care to ensure uninterrupted high-quality care across the life span for patients with SBS/IF.",
