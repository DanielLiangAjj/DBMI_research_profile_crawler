        "Title": "CPEB3 low-complexity motif regulates local protein synthesis via protein-protein interactions in neuronal ribonucleoprotein granules.",
        "Abstract": "Biomolecular condensates, membraneless organelles found throughout the cell, play critical roles in many aspects of cellular function. Ribonucleoprotein granules (RNPs) are a type of biomolecular condensate necessary for local protein synthesis and are involved in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Most of the proteins in RNPs possess low-complexity motifs (LCM), allowing for increased promiscuity of protein-protein interactions. Here, we describe the importance of protein-protein interactions mediated by the LCM of RNA-binding protein cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 3 (CPEB3). CPEB3 is necessary for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory persistence, but the mechanisms involved are still not completely elucidated. We now present key mechanisms involved in its regulation of synaptic plasticity. We find that CPEB3-LCM plays a role in appropriate local protein synthesis of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) targets, through crucial protein-protein interactions that drive localization to neuronal Decapping protein 1 (DCP1)-bodies. Translation-promoting CPEB3 and translation-inhibiting CPEB1 are packaged into neuronal RNP granules immediately after chemical long-term potentiation is induced, but only translation-promoting CPEB3 is repackaged to these organelles at later time points. This localization to neuronal RNP granules is critical for functional influence on translation as well as overall local protein synthesis (measured as Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) insertion into the membrane and localization to the synapse). We therefore conclude that protein-protein interaction between the LCM of CPEB3 plays a critical role in local protein synthesis by utilizing neuronal RNP granules.",

        "Abstract": "Optical clearing methods serve as powerful tools to study intact organs and neuronal circuits. We developed an aqueous clearing protocol, Fast 3D Clear, that relies on tetrahydrofuran for tissue delipidation and iohexol for clearing, such that tissues can be imaged under immersion oil in light-sheet imaging systems. Fast 3D Clear requires 3 days to achieve high transparency of adult and embryonic mouse tissues while maintaining their anatomical integrity and preserving a vast array of transgenic and viral/dye fluorophores. A unique advantage of Fast 3D Clear is its complete reversibility and thus compatibility with tissue sectioning and immunohistochemistry. Fast 3D Clear can be easily and quickly applied to a wide range of biomedical studies, facilitating the acquisition of high-resolution two- and three-dimensional images.",

        "Abstract": "Does abstract art evoke a different cognitive state than figurative art? To address this question empirically, we bridged art theory and cognitive research and designed an experiment leveraging construal level theory (CLT). CLT is based on experimental data showing that psychologically distant events (i.e., occurring farther away in space or time) are represented more abstractly than closer events. We measured construal level elicited by abstract vs. representational art and asked subjects to assign abstract/representational paintings by the same artist to a situation that was temporally/spatially near or distant. Across three experiments, we found that abstract paintings were assigned to the distant situation significantly more often than representational paintings, indicating that abstract art was evocative of greater psychological distance. Our data demonstrate that different levels of artistic abstraction evoke different levels of mental abstraction and suggest that CLT provides an empirical approach to the analysis of cognitive states evoked by different levels of artistic abstraction.",

        "Abstract": "Long-term sensitization of the gill withdrawal reflex in Aplysia requires heterosynaptic, modulatory input that is mediated in part by the growth of new synaptic connections between sensory neurons and their follower cells (intrinsic mediating circuit). Whether modulatory interneurons (the extrinsic modulatory circuit) also display learning-related structural synaptic plasticity remains unknown. To test this idea, we added a bona fide serotonergic modulatory neuron, the metacerebral cell (MCC), to sensory-motor neuron co-cultures and examined the modulating presynaptic varicosities of MCCs before and after repeated pulses of serotonin (5-HT) that induced long-term facilitation (LTF). We observed robust growth of new serotonergic varicosities that were positive for serotonin and capable of synaptic recycling. Our findings demonstrate that, in addition to structural changes in the intrinsic mediating circuit, there are also significant learning-related structural changes in the extrinsic modulating circuit, and these changes might provide a cellular mechanism for savings and for spread of memory.",

        "Title": "CPEB3 inhibits translation of mRNA targets by localizing them to P bodies.",
        "Abstract": "Protein synthesis is crucial for the maintenance of long-term memory-related synaptic plasticity. The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) regulates the translation of several mRNAs important for long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. In previous studies, we found that the oligomerization and activity of CPEB3 are controlled by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation. In the basal state, CPEB3 is SUMOylated; it is soluble and acts as a repressor of translation. Following neuronal stimulation, CPEB3 is de-SUMOylated; it now forms oligomers that are converted into an active form that promotes the translation of target mRNAs. To better understand how CPEB3 regulates the translation of its mRNA targets, we have examined CPEB3 subcellular localization. We found that basal, repressive CPEB3 is localized to membraneless cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies), subcellular compartments that are enriched in translationally repressed mRNA. This basal state is affected by the SUMOylation state of CPEB3. After stimulation, CPEB3 is recruited into polysomes, thus promoting the translation of its target mRNAs. Interestingly, when we examined CPEB3 recombinant protein in vitro, we found that CPEB3 phase separates when SUMOylated and binds to a specific mRNA target. These findings suggest a model whereby SUMO regulates the distribution, oligomerization, and activity of oligomeric CPEB3, a critical player in the persistence of memory.",

        "Abstract": "TIA1 is a prion-related RNA-binding protein whose capacity to form various types of intracellular aggregates has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. However, its role in normal brain function is poorly understood. Here, we show that TIA1 bidirectionally modulates stress-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in fear memory and olfactory discrimination learning. At the behavioral level, conditioned odor avoidance is potentiated by TIA1 deletion, whereas overexpression of TIA1 in the ventral hippocampus inhibits both contextual fear memory and avoidance. However, the latter genetic manipulations have little impact on other hippocampus-dependent tasks. Transcriptional profiling indicates that TIA1 presides over a large network of immune system genes with modulatory roles in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Our results uncover a physiological and partly sex-dependent function for TIA1 in fear memory and may provide molecular insight into stress-related psychiatric conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety.",

        "Abstract": "The generalization of fear memories is an adaptive neurobiological process that promotes survival in complex and dynamic environments. When confronted with a potential threat, an animal must select an appropriate defensive response based on previous experiences that are not identical, weighing cues and contextual information that may predict safety or danger. Like other aspects of fear memory, generalization is mediated by the coordinated actions of prefrontal, hippocampal, amygdalar, and thalamic brain areas. In this review article, we describe the current understanding of the behavioral, neural, genetic, and biochemical mechanisms involved in the generalization of fear. Fear generalization is a hallmark of many anxiety and stress-related disorders, and its emergence, severity, and manifestation are sex-dependent. Therefore, to improve the dialog between human and animal studies as well as to accelerate the development of effective therapeutics, we emphasize the need to examine both sex differences and remote timescales in rodent models.",

In recent years, our understanding of the cellular architecture supporting long-term memory traces has also substantially improved. However, the molecular biology of consolidation at the level of neuronal systems has been relatively neglected. In this opinion article, we first examine our current understanding of the cellular mechanisms of synaptic consolidation. We then outline areas requiring further investigation on how cellular changes contribute to systems consolidation. Finally, we highlight recent findings on the cellular architecture of memory traces in rodents and how the application of new technologies will expand our understanding of systems consolidation at the neural circuit level. In the coming years, this research focus will be critical for understanding the evolution of long-term memories and for enabling the development of novel therapeutics which embrace the dynamic nature of memories.",

        "Abstract": "Precisely deciphering the molecular mechanisms of age-related memory loss is crucial to create appropriate therapeutic interventions. We have previously shown that the histone-binding protein RbAp48/Rbbp4 is a molecular determinant of Age-Related Memory Loss. By exploring how this protein regulates the genomic landscape of the hippocampal circuit, we find that RbAp48 controls the expression of BDNF and GPR158 proteins, both critical components of osteocalcin (OCN) signaling in the mouse hippocampus. We show that inhibition of RbAp48 in the hippocampal formation inhibits OCN's beneficial functions in cognition and causes deficits in discrimination memory. In turn, disruption of OCN/GPR158 signaling leads to the downregulation of RbAp48 protein, mimicking the discrimination memory deficits observed in the aged hippocampus. We also show that activation of the OCN/GPR158 pathway increases the expression of RbAp48 in the aged dentate gyrus and rescues age-related memory loss.",

However, p-eIF2Î± has not been examined with regard to psychoactive cannabinoids and cross-sensitization. Here, we find that a cannabinoid receptor agonistÂ (WIN 55,212-2 mesylate [WIN]) reduced p-eIF2Î± inÂ vitro by upregulating GADD34 (PPP1R15A), theÂ recruiter of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The induction of GADD34 was linked to ERK/CREB signaling and to CREB-binding protein (CBP)-mediated histone hyperacetylation at the Gadd34 locus. InÂ vitro, WIN also upregulated eIF2B1, an eIF2 activator subunit. We next found that WIN administration inÂ vivo reduced p-eIF2Î± in the nucleus accumbens ofÂ adolescent, but not adult, rats. By contrast, WIN increased dorsal striatal levels of eIF2B1 and ÎFosB among both adolescents and adults. In addition, weÂ found cross-sensitization between WIN and cocaine only among adolescents. These findings show that cannabinoids can modulate eukaryotic initiation factors, and they suggest a possible link between p-eIF2Î± and the gateway drug properties of psychoactive cannabinoids.",

        "Abstract": "Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, TÂ cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance of TIA-1-positive stress granules in arsenite-treated cells are inhibited by TPEN. In addition, Zn",

        "Abstract": "Prions are proteins that can adopt self-perpetuating conformations and are traditionally regarded as etiological agents of infectious neurodegenerative diseases in humans, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, and transmissible encephalopathies. More recently, a growing consensus has emerged that prion-like, self-templating mechanisms also underlie a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. Perhaps most surprising, not all prion-like aggregates are associated with pathological changes. There are now several examples of prion-like proteins in mammals that serve positive biological functions in their aggregated state. In this review, we discuss functional prions in the nervous system, with particular emphasis on the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB) and the role of its prion-like aggregates in synaptic plasticity and memory. We also mention a more recent example of a functional prion-like protein in the brain, TIA-1, and its role during stress. These studies of functional prion-like proteins have provided a number of generalizable insights on how prion-based protein switches may operate to serve physiological functions in higher eukaryotes.",

        "Abstract": "Prions are self-propagating protein conformations that are traditionally regarded as agents of neurodegenerative disease in animals. However, it has become evident that prion-like aggregation of endogenous proteins can also occur under normal physiological conditions (e.g., during memory storage or activation of the immune response). In this review, we focus on the functional prion-related protein TIA-1, an RNA-binding protein that is involved in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism but is best understood in terms of its role in stress granule assembly during the cellular stress response. We propose that stress granule formation provides a useful conceptual framework with which to address the positive role of TIA-1 prion-like aggregation. Elucidating the function of TIA-1 prion-like aggregation will advance our understanding of how prion-based molecular switches are used in normal physiological settings.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine neurotransmission in the dorsal hippocampus is critical for a range of functions from spatial learning and synaptic plasticity to the deficits underlying psychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is the presumed source of dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus. However, there is a surprising scarcity of VTA dopamine axons in the dorsal hippocampus despite the dense network of dopamine receptors. We have explored this apparent paradox using optogenetic, biochemical, and behavioral approaches and found that dopaminergic axons and subsequent dopamine release in the dorsal hippocampus originate from neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC). Photostimulation of LC axons produced an increase in dopamine release in the dorsal hippocampus as revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Furthermore, optogenetically induced release of dopamine from the LC into the dorsal hippocampus enhanced selective attention and spatial object recognition via the dopamine D1/D5 receptor. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory are energized by the release of dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus from noradrenergic neurons of the LC. The present findings are critical for identifying the neural circuits that enable proper attention selection and successful learning and memory.",

        "Abstract": "Prions are a self-templating amyloidogenic state of normal cellular proteins, such as prion protein (PrP). They have been identified as the pathogenic agents, contributing to a number of diseases of the nervous system. However, the discovery that the neuronal RNA-binding protein, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB), has a prion-like state that is involved in the stabilization of memory raised the possibility that prion-like proteins can serve normal physiological functions in the nervous system. Here, we review recent experimental evidence of prion-like properties of neuronal CPEB in various organisms and propose a model of how the prion-like state may stabilize memory.",

        "Abstract": "Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) function is critical to decision making and behavior based on the value of expected outcomes. While some of the roles the OFC plays in value computations and behavior have been identified, the role of the OFC in modulating cognitive resources based on reward expectancy has not been explored. Here we assessed the involvement of OFC in the interaction between motivation and attention. We tested mice in a sustained-attention task in which explicitly signaling the probability of reward differentially modulates discrimination accuracy. Using pharmacogenetic methods, we generated mice in which neuronal activity in the OFC could be transiently and reversibly inhibited during performance of our signaled-probability task. We found that inhibiting OFC neuronal activity abolished the ability of reward-associated cues to differentially impact accuracy of sustained-attention performance. This failure to modulate attention occurred despite evidence that mice still processed the differential value of the reward-associated cues. These data indicate that OFC function is critical for the ability of a reward-related signal to impact other cognitive and decision-making processes and begin to delineate the neural circuitry involved in the interaction between motivation and attention.",

        "Abstract": "Consolidation of implicit memory in the invertebrate Aplysia and explicit memory in the mammalian hippocampus are associated with remodeling and growth of preexisting synapses and the formation of new synapses. Here, we compare and contrast structural components of the synaptic plasticity that underlies these two distinct forms of memory. In both cases, the structural changes involve time-dependent processes. Thus, some modifications are transient and may contribute to early formative stages of long-term memory, whereas others are more stable, longer lasting, and likely to confer persistence to memory storage. In addition, we explore the possibility that trans-synaptic signaling mechanisms governing de novo synapse formation during development can be reused in the adult for the purposes of structural synaptic plasticity and memory storage. Finally, we discuss how these mechanisms set in motion structural rearrangements that prepare a synapse to strengthen the same memory and, perhaps, to allow it to take part in other memories as a basis for understanding how their anatomical representation results in the enhanced expression and storage of memories in the brain.",

        "Abstract": "The maintenance phase of memory-related long-term facilitation (LTF) of synapses between sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia depends on a serotonin (5-HT)-triggered presynaptic upregulation of CPEB, a functional prion that regulates local protein synthesis at the synapse. The mechanisms whereby serotonin regulates CPEB levels in presynaptic sensory neurons are not known. Here, we describe a sensory neuron-specific microRNA 22 (miR-22) that has multiple binding sites on the mRNA of CPEB and inhibits it in the basal state. Serotonin triggers MAPK/Erk-dependent downregulation of miR-22, thereby upregulating the expression of CPEB, which in turn regulates, through functional CPE elements, the presynaptic expression of atypical PKC (aPKC), another candidate regulator of memory maintenance. Our findings support a model in which the neurotransmitter-triggered downregulation of miR-22 coordinates the regulation of genes contributing synergistically to the long-term maintenance of memory-related synaptic plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "The mouse cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) is a translational regulator implicated in long-term memory maintenance. Invertebrate orthologs of CPEB3 in Aplysia and Drosophila are functional prions that are physiologically active in the aggregated state. To determine if this principle applies to the mammalian CPEB3, we expressed it in yeast and found that it forms heritable aggregates that are the hallmark of known prions. In addition, we confirm in the mouse the importance of CPEB3's prion formation for CPEB3 function. Interestingly, deletion analysis of the CPEB3 prion domain uncovered a tripartite organization: two aggregation-promoting domains surround a regulatory module that affects interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. In all, our data provide direct evidence that CPEB3 is a functional prion in the mammalian brain and underline the potential importance of an actin/CPEB3 feedback loop for the synaptic plasticity underlying the persistence of long-term memory.",

        "Abstract": "Protein synthesis is crucial for the maintenance of long-term-memory-related synaptic plasticity. The prion-like cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) regulates the translation of several mRNAs important for long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Here, we provide evidence that the prion-like aggregation and activity of CPEB3 is controlled by SUMOylation. In the basal state, CPEB3 is a repressor and is soluble. Under these circumstances, CPEB3 is SUMOylated in hippocampal neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Following neuronal stimulation, CPEB3 is converted into an active form that promotes the translation of target mRNAs, and this is associated with a decrease of SUMOylation and an increase of aggregation. A chimeric CPEB3 protein fused to SUMO cannot form aggregates and cannot activate the translation of target mRNAs. These findings suggest a model whereby SUMO regulates translation of mRNAs and structural synaptic plasticity by modulating the aggregation of the prion-like protein CPEB3.",

        "Title": "The Persistence of Hippocampal-Based Memory Requires Protein Synthesis Mediated by the Prion-like Protein CPEB3.",
        "Abstract": "Consolidation of long-term memories depends on de novo protein synthesis. Several translational regulators have been identified, and their contribution to the formation of memory has been assessed in the mouse hippocampus. None of them, however, has been implicated in the persistence of memory. Although persistence is a key feature of long-term memory, how this occurs, despite the rapid turnover of its molecular substrates, is poorly understood. Here we find that both memory storage and its underlying synaptic plasticity are mediated by the increase in level and in the aggregation of the prion-like translational regulator CPEB3 (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein). Genetic ablation of CPEB3 impairs the maintenance of both hippocampal long-term potentiation and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. We propose a model whereby persistence of long-term memory results from the assembly of CPEB3 into aggregates. These aggregates serve as functional prions and regulate local protein synthesis necessary for the maintenance of long-term memory.",

        "Title": "The regulation of transcription in memory consolidation.",
        "Abstract": "De novo transcription of DNA is a fundamental requirement for the formation of long-term memory. It is required during both consolidation and reconsolidation, the posttraining and postreactivation phases that change the state of the memory from a fragile into a stable and long-lasting form. Transcription generates both mRNAs that are translated into proteins, which are necessary for the growth of new synaptic connections, as well as noncoding RNA transcripts that have regulatory or effector roles in gene expression. The result is a cascade of events that ultimately leads to structural changes in the neurons that mediate long-term memory storage. The de novo transcription, critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, is orchestrated by chromatin and epigenetic modifications. The complexity of transcription regulation, its temporal progression, and the effectors produced all contribute to the flexibility and persistence of long-term memory formation. In this article, we provide an overview of the mechanisms contributing to this transcriptional regulation underlying long-term memory formation.",

        "Abstract": "Tia1/Pub1 is a stress granule component carrying a Q/N-rich prion domain. We provide direct evidence that Tia1 forms a prion in yeast. Moreover, Tia1/Pub1 acts cooperatively with release factor Sup35/eRF3 to establish a two-protein self-propagating state. This two-protein prion driven by the Q/N-rich prion domains of Sup35 and Tia1/Pub1 can be visualized as distinctive line structures along tubulin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, we find that tubulin-associated complex containing Pub1 and Sup35 oligomers normally exists in yeast, and its assembly depends on prion domains of Pub1 and Sup35. This Sup35/Pub1 complex, which also contains TUB1 mRNA and components of translation machinery, is important for the integrity of the tubulin cytoskeleton: PUB1 disruption and Sup35 depletion from the complex lead to cytoskeletal defects. We propose that the complex is implicated in protein synthesis at the site of microtubule assembly. Thus our study identifies the role for prion domains in the assembly of multiprotein complexes.",

        "Abstract": "A common genetic polymorphism that results in increased activity of the dopamine regulating enzyme COMT (the COMT Val(158) allele) has been found to associate with poorer cognitive performance and increased susceptibility to develop psychiatric disorders. It is generally assumed that this increase in COMT activity influences cognitive function and psychiatric disease risk by increasing dopamine turnover in cortical synapses, though this cannot be directly measured in humans. Here we explore a novel transgenic mouse model of increased COMT activity, equivalent to the relative increase in activity observed with the human COMT Val(158) allele. By performing an extensive battery of behavioral tests, we found that COMT overexpressing mice (COMT-OE mice) exhibit cognitive deficits selectively in the domains that are affected by the COMT Val(158) allele, stimulus-response learning and working memory, functionally validating our model of increased COMT activity. Although we detected no changes in the level of markers for dopamine synthesis and dopamine transport, we found that COMT-OE mice display an increase in dopamine release capacity in the striatum. This result suggests that increased COMT activity may not only affect dopamine signaling by enhancing synaptic clearance in the cortex, but may also cause changes in presynaptic dopamine function in the striatum. These changes may underlie the behavioral deficits observed in the mice and might also play a role in the cognitive deficits and increased psychiatric disease risk associated with genetic variation in COMT activity in humans.",

        "Abstract": "The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is critical for spatial memory and is also thought to be involved in the formation of drug-related associative memory. Here, we attempt to test an aspect of the Gateway Hypothesis, by studying the effect of consecutive exposure to nicotine and cocaine on long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the DG. We find that a single injection of cocaine does not alter LTP. However, pretreatment with nicotine followed by a single injection of cocaine causes a substantial enhancement of LTP. This priming effect of nicotine is unidirectional: There is no enhancement of LTP if cocaine is administrated prior to nicotine. The facilitation induced by nicotine and cocaine can be blocked by oral administration of the dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist (SKF 83566) and enhanced by the D1/D5 agonist (SKF 38393). Application of the histone deacetylation inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) simulates the priming effect of nicotine on cocaine. By contrast, the priming effect of nicotine on cocaine is blocked in genetically modified mice that are haploinsufficient for the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and possess only one functional CBP allele and therefore exhibit a reduction in histone acetylation. These results demonstrate that the DG of the hippocampus is an important brain region contributing to the priming effect of nicotine on cocaine. Moreover, both activation of dopamine-D1 receptor/PKA signaling pathway and histone deacetylation/CBP mediated transcription are required for the nicotine priming effect in the DG.",

        "Title": "Molecular mechanism for age-related memory loss: the histone-binding protein RbAp48.",
        "Abstract": "To distinguish age-related memory loss more explicitly from Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have explored its molecular underpinning in the dentate gyrus (DG), a subregion of the hippocampal formation thought to be targeted by aging. We carried out a gene expression study in human postmortem tissue harvested from both DG and entorhinal cortex (EC), a neighboring subregion unaffected by aging and known to be the site of onset of AD. Using expression in the EC for normalization, we identified 17 genes that manifested reliable age-related changes in the DG. The most significant change was an age-related decline in RbAp48, a histone-binding protein that modifies histone acetylation. To test whether the RbAp48 decline could be responsible for age-related memory loss, we turned to mice and found that, consistent with humans, RbAp48 was less abundant in the DG of old than in young mice. We next generated a transgenic mouse that expressed a dominant-negative inhibitor of RbAp48 in the adult forebrain. Inhibition of RbAp48 in young mice caused hippocampus-dependent memory deficits similar to those associated with aging, as measured by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that within the hippocampal formation, dysfunction was selectively observed in the DG, and this corresponded to a regionally selective decrease in histone acetylation. Up-regulation of RbAp48 in the DG of aged wild-type mice ameliorated age-related hippocampus-based memory loss and age-related abnormalities in histone acetylation. Together, these findings show that the DG is a hippocampal subregion targeted by aging, and identify molecular mechanisms of cognitive aging that could serve as valid targets for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Abstract": "In many cortical neurons, HCN1 channels are the major contributors to Ih, the hyperpolarization-activated current, which regulates the intrinsic properties of neurons and shapes their integration of synaptic inputs, paces rhythmic activity, and regulates synaptic plasticity. Here, we examine the physiological role of Ih in deep layer pyramidal neurons in mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), focusing on persistent activity, a form of sustained firing thought to be important for the behavioral function of the PFC during working memory tasks. We find that HCN1 contributes to the intrinsic persistent firing that is induced by a brief depolarizing current stimulus in the presence of muscarinic agonists. Deletion of HCN1 or acute pharmacological blockade of Ih decreases the fraction of neurons capable of generating persistent firing. The reduction in persistent firing is caused by the membrane hyperpolarization that results from the deletion of HCN1 or Ih blockade, rather than a specific role of the hyperpolarization-activated current in generating persistent activity. In vivo recordings show that deletion of HCN1 has no effect on up states, periods of enhanced synaptic network activity. Parallel behavioral studies demonstrate that HCN1 contributes to the PFC-dependent resolution of proactive interference during working memory. These results thus provide genetic evidence demonstrating the importance of HCN1 to intrinsic persistent firing and the behavioral output of the PFC. The causal role of intrinsic persistent firing in PFC-mediated behavior remains an open question.",

        "Abstract": "Despite cash-strapped times for research, several ambitious collaborative neuroscience projects have attracted large amounts of funding and media attention. In Europe, the Human Brain Project aims to develop a large-scale computer simulation of the brain, whereas in the United States, the Brain Activity Map is working towards establishing a functional connectome of the entire brain, and the Allen Institute for Brain Science has embarked upon a 10-year project to understand the mouse visual cortex (the MindScope project). US President Barack Obama's announcement of the BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative) in April 2013 highlights the political commitment to neuroscience and is expected to further foster interdisciplinary collaborations, accelerate the development of new technologies and thus fuel much needed medical advances. In this Viewpoint article, five prominent neuroscientists explain the aims of the projects and how they are addressing some of the questions (and criticisms) that have arisen.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, a greater understanding has emerged of the role epigenetic mechanisms play in the brain, not only during development, but also in mature neurons involved in long-term memory. The identification of spatially and temporally tuned epigenetic modification of genetic loci during memory storage has revealed the remarkably input-responsive, target-specific, and long-term nature of epigenetic regulation, but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. New insight into these mechanisms has come from the study of small RNAs, which have emerged as regulators that can confer sequence specificity to DNA- and chromatin-modifying processes. We discuss advances in the elucidation of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in long-term memory, focusing on the role of small RNAs, and in particular piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), in the epigenetic regulation underlying memory storage.",

        "Title": "Nicotine primes the effect of cocaine on the induction of LTP in the amygdala.",
        "Abstract": "In human populations, there is a well-defined sequence of involvement in drugs of abuse, in which the use of nicotine or alcohol precedes the use of marijuana, which in turn, precedes the use of cocaine. The term \"Gateway Hypothesis\" describes this developmental sequence of drug involvement. In prior work, we have developed a mouse model to study the underlying metaplastic behavioral, cellular and molecular mechanisms by which exposure to one drug, namely nicotine, affects the response to another drug, namely cocaine. We found that nicotine enhances significantly the changes in synaptic plasticity in the striatum induced by cocaine (Levine etÂ al., 2011). Here we ask: does the metaplastic effect of nicotine on cocaine also apply in the amygdala, a brain region that is involved in the orchestration of emotions and in drug addiction? We find that pretreatment with nicotine enhances long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in response to cocaine in the amygdala. Both short-term (1 day) and long-term (7 days) pre-exposure to nicotine facilitate the induction of LTP by cocaine. The effect of nicotine on LTP is unidirectional; exposure to nicotine following treatment with cocaine is ineffective. This metaplastic effect of nicotine on cocaine is long lasting but reversible. The facilitation of LTP can be obtained for 24 but not 40 days after cessation of nicotine. As is the case in the striatum, pretreatment with Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, simulates the priming effect of nicotine. These results provide further evidence that the priming effect of nicotine may be achieved, at least partially, by the inhibition of histone acetylation and indicate that the amygdala appears to be an important brain structure for the processing of the metaplastic effect of nicotine on cocaine. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Glutamate Receptor-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity'.",

Our approach is based on the characterization of RNA transport complexes carried by molecular motor kinesin. Using this strategy in Aplysia, we have identified 5,657 unique sequences consisting of both coding and noncoding RNAs from the CNS. Several of these RNAs have key roles in the maintenance of synaptic function and growth. One of these RNAs, myosin heavy chain, is critical in presynaptic sensory neurons for the establishment of long-term facilitation, but not for its persistence.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotrophins control the development and adult plasticity of the vertebrate nervous system. Failure to identify invertebrate neurotrophin orthologs, however, has precluded studies in invertebrate models, limiting our understanding of fundamental aspects of neurotrophin biology and function. We identified a neurotrophin (ApNT) and Trk receptor (ApTrk) in the mollusk Aplysia and found that they play a central role in learning-related synaptic plasticity. Blocking ApTrk signaling impairs long-term facilitation, whereas augmenting ApNT expression enhances it and induces the growth of new synaptic varicosities at the monosynaptic connection between sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex. Unlike vertebrate neurotrophins, ApNT has multiple coding exons and exerts distinct synaptic effects through differentially processed and secreted splice isoforms. Our findings demonstrate the existence of bona fide neurotrophin signaling in invertebrates and reveal a posttranscriptional mechanism that regulates neurotrophin processing and the release of proneurotrophins and mature neurotrophins that differentially modulate synaptic plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "Small RNA-mediated gene regulation during development causes long-lasting changes in cellular phenotypes. To determine whether small RNAs of the adult brain can regulate memory storage, a process that requires stable and long-lasting changes in the functional state of neurons, we generated small RNA libraries from the Aplysia CNS. In these libraries, we discovered an unexpectedly abundant expression of a 28 nucleotide sized class of piRNAs in brain, which had been thought to be germline specific. These piRNAs have unique biogenesis patterns, predominant nuclear localization, and robust sensitivity to serotonin, a modulatory transmitter that is important for memory. We find that the Piwi/piRNA complex facilitates serotonin-dependent methylation of a conserved CpG island in the promoter of CREB2, the major inhibitory constraint of memory in Aplysia, leading to enhanced long-term synaptic facilitation. These findings provide a small RNA-mediated gene regulatory mechanism for establishing stable long-term changes in neurons for the persistence of memory.",

        "Abstract": "The synapse is the functional unit of the brain. During the last several decades we have acquired a great deal of information on its structure, molecular components, and physiological function. It is clear that synapses are morphologically and molecularly diverse and that this diversity is recruited to different functions. One of the most intriguing findings is that the size of the synaptic response in not invariant, but can be altered by a variety of homo- and heterosynaptic factors such as past patterns of use or modulatory neurotransmitters. Perhaps the most difficult challenge in neuroscience is to design experiments that reveal how these basic building blocks of the brain are put together and how they are regulated to mediate the information flow through neural circuits that is necessary to produce complex behaviors and store memories. In this review we will focus on studies that attempt to uncover the role of synaptic plasticity in the regulation of whole-animal behavior by learning and memory.",

The incorporation of expressed actin-GFP monomers into endogenous actin polymers enables energy migration FRET (emFRET, or homoFRET) between neighboring actin-GFPs. This energy migration reduces the normally high polarization of the GFP fluorescence. We derive a simple relationship between the actin-GFP fluorescence polarization anisotropy and the actin polymer fraction, thereby enabling a robust means of imaging the actin polymerization state with high spatiotemporal resolution and providing what to the best of our knowledge are the first direct images of the actin polymerization state in live, adult brain tissue and live, intact Drosophila larvae.",

        "Abstract": "The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3), a regulator of local protein synthesis, is the mouse homolog of ApCPEB, a functional prion protein in Aplysia. Here, we provide evidence that CPEB3 is activated by Neuralized1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In hippocampal cultures, CPEB3 activated by Neuralized1-mediated ubiquitination leads both to the growth of new dendritic spines and to an increase of the GluA1 and GluA2 subunits of AMPA receptors, two CPEB3 targets essential for synaptic plasticity. Conditional overexpression of Neuralized1 similarly increases GluA1 and GluA2 and the number of spines and functional synapses in the hippocampus and is reflected in enhanced hippocampal-dependent memory and synaptic plasticity. By contrast, inhibition of Neuralized1 reduces GluA1 and GluA2 levels and impairs hippocampal-dependent memory and synaptic plasticity. These results suggest a model whereby Neuralized1-dependent ubiquitination facilitates hippocampal plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory storage by modulating the activity of CPEB3 and CPEB3-dependent protein synthesis and synapse formation.",

HCN1 is strongly expressed in CA1 neurons and in entorhinal cortex grid cells, which provide spatial information to the hippocampus. Both CA1 and CA3 place fields were larger but more stable in the knockout mice, with the effect greater in CA1 than CA3. As HCN1 is only weakly expressed in CA3 place cells, their altered activity likely reflects loss of HCN1 in grid cells. The more pronounced changes in CA1 likely reflect the intrinsic contribution of HCN1. The enhanced place field stability may underlie the effect of HCN1 deletion to facilitate spatial learning and memory.",

        "Title": "Molecular mechanism for a gateway drug: epigenetic changes initiated by nicotine prime gene expression by cocaine.",
        "Abstract": "In human populations, cigarettes and alcohol generally serve as gateway drugs, which people use first before progressing to marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit substances. To understand the biological basis of the gateway sequence of drug use, we developed an animal model in mice and used it to study the effects of nicotine on subsequent responses to cocaine. We found that pretreatment of mice with nicotine increased the response to cocaine, as assessed by addiction-related behaviors and synaptic plasticity in the striatum, a brain region critical for addiction-related reward. Locomotor sensitization was increased by 98%, conditioned place preference was increased by 78%, and cocaine-induced reduction in long-term potentiation (LTP) was enhanced by 24%. The responses to cocaine were altered only when nicotine was administered first, and nicotine and cocaine were then administered concurrently. Reversing the order of drug administration was ineffective; cocaine had no effect on nicotine-induced behaviors and synaptic plasticity. Nicotine primed the response to cocaine by enhancing its ability to induce transcriptional activation of the FosB gene through inhibition of histone deacetylase, which caused global histone acetylation in the striatum. We tested this conclusion further and found that a histone deacetylase inhibitor simulated the actions of nicotine by priming the response to cocaine and enhancing FosB gene expression and LTP depression in the nucleus accumbens. Conversely, in a genetic mouse model characterized by reduced histone acetylation, the effects of cocaine on LTP were diminished. We achieved a similar effect by infusing a low dose of theophylline, an activator of histone deacetylase, into the nucleus accumbens. These results from mice prompted an analysis of epidemiological data, which indicated that most cocaine users initiate cocaine use after the onset of smoking and while actively still smoking, and that initiating cocaine use after smoking increases the risk of becoming dependent on cocaine, consistent with our data from mice. If our findings in mice apply to humans, a decrease in smoking rates in young people would be expected to lead to a decrease in cocaine addiction.",

        "Abstract": "Neurexin and neuroligin, which undergo heterophilic interactions with each other at the synapse, are mutated in some patients with autism spectrum disorder, a set of disorders characterized by deficits in social and emotional learning. We have explored the role of neurexin and neuroligin at sensory-to-motor neuron synapses of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia, which undergoes sensitization, a simple form of learned fear. We find that depleting neurexin in the presynaptic sensory neuron or neuroligin in the postsynaptic motor neuron abolishes both long-term facilitation and the associated presynaptic growth induced by repeated pulses of serotonin. Moreover, introduction into the motor neuron of the R451C mutation of neuroligin-3 linked to autism spectrum disorder blocks both intermediate-term and long-term facilitation. Our results suggest that activity-dependent regulation of the neurexin-neuroligin interaction may govern transsynaptic signaling required for the storage of long-term memory, including emotional memory that may be impaired in autism spectrum disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Distorted interval timing is a common feature of the cognitive impairment observed in patients with schizophrenia. The neural circuits which are required for interval timing and those thought to be compromised in schizophrenia overlap and include the cortico-striatal pathways. Here, we suggest that a focus on temporal information processing offers a window into understanding the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia and how deficits might contribute to a variety of symptoms. A disruption in the functioning of the cortico-striatal pathways may lead to cognitive deficits which in turn lead to impaired processing of temporal information. Disrupted temporal processing may also contribute to a variety of other symptoms associated with the disorder. Because interval timing is a cognitive/behavioral phenotype that can easily be assessed in animals it can be used as a sensitive screen for deficits in animal models. Using a recently developed transgenic mouse that models increased D2 receptor upregulation in the striatum similar to that observed in patients with schizophrenia we illustrate the utility of an interval timing approach in assessing cognitive impairment. We further discuss how variants of timing procedures can be used to assess attention and working memory performance as well as other necessary components of adaptive cognitive function.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years it has become possible to develop animal models of psychiatric disease in genetically modified mice. While great strides have been made in the development of genetic and neurobiological tools with which to model psychiatric disease, elucidation of neural and molecular mechanisms thought to underlie behavioral phenotypes has been hindered by an inadequate analysis of behavior. This is unfortunate given the fact that the experimental analysis of behavior has created powerful methods for isolating and describing the functional properties of behavioral mechanisms that are capable of providing deep understanding of behavioral phenotypes. A better understanding of the biological basis of normal behavior and its disturbance in psychiatric disease will require the application of these rigorous behavior analytic tools to animal models. In this review we provide an example of a merging of genetic and behavioral methods and illustrate its utility in the analysis of a mouse model of the motivational deficits in schizophrenia. The synergy between basic behavior analysis, neuroscience, and animal models of psychiatric disease has great potential for achieving a deeper understanding of behavior and its neurobiological mechanisms as well as for leading to improvements in diagnosis and treatment in clinical settings.",

        "Abstract": "Whereas short-term plasticity involves covalent modifications that are generally restricted to either presynaptic or postsynaptic structures, long-term plasticity involves the growth of new synapses, which by its nature involves both pre- and postsynaptic alterations. In addition, an intermediate-term stage of plasticity has been identified that might form a bridge between short- and long-term plasticity. Consistent with that idea, although short-term term behavioral sensitization in Aplysia involves presynaptic mechanisms, intermediate-term sensitization involves both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms. However, it has not been known whether that is also true of facilitation in vitro, where a more detailed analysis of the mechanisms involved in the different stages and their interrelations is feasible. To address those questions, we have examined pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of short- and intermediate-term facilitation at Aplysia sensory-motor neuron synapses in isolated cell culture. Whereas short-term facilitation by 1-min 5-HT involves presynaptic PKA and CamKII, intermediate-term facilitation by 10-min 5-HT involves presynaptic PKC and postsynaptic Ca(2+) and CamKII, as well as both pre- and postsynaptic protein synthesis. These results support the idea that the intermediate-term stage is the first to involve both pre- and postsynaptic molecular mechanisms, which could in turn serve as some of the initial steps in a cascade leading to synaptic growth during long-term plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "The functional switch of glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich prions and the neurotoxicity of polyQ-expanded proteins involve complex aggregation-prone structural transitions, commonly presumed to be forming Î² sheets. By analyzing sequences of interaction partners of these proteins, we discovered a recurrent presence of coiled-coil domains both in the partners and in segments that flank or overlap Q/N-rich and polyQ domains. Since coiled coils can mediate protein interactions and multimerization, we studied their possible involvement in Q/N-rich and polyQ aggregations. Using circular dichroism and chemical crosslinking, we found that Q/N-rich and polyQ peptides form Î±-helical coiled coils inÂ vitro and assemble into multimers. Using structure-guided mutagenesis, we found that coiled-coil domains modulate inÂ vivo properties of two Q/N-rich prions and polyQ-expanded huntingtin. Mutations that disrupt coiled coils impair aggregation and activity, whereas mutations that enhance coiled-coil propensity promote aggregation. These findings support a coiled-coil model for the functional switch of Q/N-rich prions and for the pathogenesis of polyQ-expansion diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Synaptic plasticity and learning involve different mechanisms depending on the following: (1) the stage of plasticity and (2) the history of plasticity, or metaplasticity. However, little is known about how these two factors are related. We have addressed that question by examining mechanisms of synaptic plasticity during short-term and intermediate-term behavioral sensitization and dishabituation in a semi-intact preparation of the Aplysia siphon-withdrawal reflex. Dishabituation differs from sensitization in that it is preceded by habituation, and is thus a paradigm for metaplasticity. We find that whereas facilitation during short-term sensitization by one tail shock involves presynaptic covalent modifications by protein kinase A (PKA) and CamKII, facilitation during intermediate-term sensitization by four shocks involves both presynaptic (PKA, CaMKII) and postsynaptic (Ca(2+), CaMKII) covalent modifications, as well as both presynaptic and postsynaptic protein synthesis. The facilitation also involves presynaptic spike broadening 2.5 min after either one or four shocks, but not at later times. Dishabituation by four shocks differs from sensitization in several ways. First, it does not involve PKA or CaMKII, but rather involves presynaptic PKC. In addition, unlike sensitization with the same shock, dishabituation by four shocks does not involve protein synthesis or presynaptic spike broadening, and it also does not involve postsynaptic Ca(2+). These results demonstrate that not only the mechanisms but also the site of plasticity depend on both the stage of plasticity and metaplasticity during memory formation.",

        "Abstract": "The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are largely resistant to current treatment and are thus a life-long burden of the illness. Studies of cognitive symptoms have commonly focused on prefrontal cortex because of its demonstrated importance for executive function and working memory--key components of the deficit. The role of striatal-cortical circuitry and therefore the striatum itself has received much less attention. Here we review longstanding evidence that the striatum and its cortical connections are critical for complex cognition and discuss emerging evidence of the striatum's potential involvement in cognitive symptoms. Finally, we suggest how mouse models might test ideas about the contribution of early striatal dysfunction to the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "Prions are proteins that can assume at least two distinct conformational states, one of which is dominant and self-perpetuating. Previously we found that a translation regulator CPEB from Aplysia, ApCPEB, that stabilizes activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy can display prion-like properties in yeast. Here we find that, when exogenously expressed in sensory neurons, ApCPEB can form an amyloidogenic self-sustaining multimer, consistent with it being a prion-like protein. In addition, we find that conversion of both the exogenous and the endogenous ApCPEB to the multimeric state is enhanced by the neurotransmitter serotonin and that an antibody that recognizes preferentially the multimeric ApCPEB blocks persistence of synaptic facilitation. These results are consistent with the idea that ApCPEB can act as a self-sustaining prion-like protein in the nervous system and thereby might allow the activity-dependent change in synaptic efficacy to persist for long periods of time.",

        "Abstract": "Memory storage and memory-related synaptic plasticity rely on precise spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. To explore the role of small regulatory RNAs in learning-related synaptic plasticity, we carried out massive parallel sequencing to profile the small RNAs of Aplysia californica. We identified 170 distinct miRNAs, 13 of which were novel and specific to Aplysia. Nine miRNAs were brain enriched, and several of these were rapidly downregulated by transient exposure to serotonin, a modulatory neurotransmitter released during learning. Further characterization of the brain-enriched miRNAs revealed that miR-124, the most abundant and well-conserved brain-specific miRNA, was exclusively present presynaptically in a sensory-motor synapse where it constrains serotonin-induced synaptic facilitation through regulation of the transcriptional factor CREB. We therefore present direct evidence that a modulatory neurotransmitter important for learning can regulate the levels of small RNAs and present a role for miR-124 in long-term plasticity of synapses in the mature nervous system.",

        "Abstract": "A key question in the analysis of hippocampal memory relates to how attention modulates the encoding and long-term retrieval of spatial and nonspatial representations in this region. To address this question, we recorded from single cells over a period of 5 days in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus while mice acquired one of two goal-oriented tasks. These tasks required the animals to find a hidden food reward by attending to either the visuospatial environment or a particular odor presented in shifting spatial locations. Attention to the visuospatial environment increased the stability of visuospatial representations and phase locking to gamma oscillations--a form of neuronal synchronization thought to underlie the attentional mechanism necessary for processing task-relevant information. Attention to a spatially shifting olfactory cue compromised the stability of place fields and increased the stability of reward-associated odor representations, which were most consistently retrieved during periods of sniffing and digging when animals were restricted to the cup locations. Together, these results suggest that attention selectively modulates the encoding and retrieval of hippocampal representations by enhancing physiological responses to task-relevant information.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampus is critically involved in storing explicit memory such as memory for space. A defining feature of explicit memory storage is that it requires attention both for encoding and retrieval. Whereas, a great deal is now known about the mechanisms of storage, the mechanisms whereby attention modulates the encoding and retrieval of space and other hippocampus-dependent memory representations are not known. In this review we discuss recent studies, including our own, which show on the cellular level that attention is critical for the stabilization of spatial and reward-associated odour representations. Our findings support the view that in the hippocampus attention selects the reference frame for task-relevant information. This mechanism is in part mediated by dopamine acting through D1/D5 receptors and involves an increase in neuronal synchronization in the gamma band frequency. We propose that synchronous activity leads to enhancements in synaptic strength that mediate the stabilization of hippocampal representations.",

        "Abstract": "Transsynaptic interactions between neurons are essential during both developmental and learning-related synaptic growth. We have used Aplysia neuronal cultures to examine the contribution of transsynaptic signals in both types of synapse formation. We find that during de novo synaptogenesis, specific presynaptic innervation is required for the clustering of postsynaptic AMPA-like but not NMDA-like receptors. We further find that the cell adhesion molecule Dscam is involved in these transsynaptic interactions. Inhibition of Dscam either pre- or postsynaptically abolishes the emergence of synaptic transmission and the clustering of AMPA-like receptors. Remodeling of both AMPA-like and NMDA-like receptors also occurs during learning-related synapse formation and again requires the reactivation of Dscam-mediated transsynaptic interactions. Taken together, these findings suggest that learning-induced synapse formation recapitulates, at least in part, aspects of the mechanisms that govern de novo synaptogenesis.",

        "Title": "Interview with eric R. Kandel: from memory, free will, and the problem with Freud to fortunate decisions.",
        "Abstract": "Eric R. Kandel shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Arvid Carlsson and Paul Greengard in 2000 for their discoveries concerning signal transduction in the nervous system. Eric Kandel was rewarded for his discoveries of molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory. He is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Senior Investigator at Columbia Universities Center for Neurobiology and Behavior. In this interview given at Hertie Foundation's Neuroforum 2008 on April 18, 2008 in Frankfurt, Germany, Nobel Prize Laureate Eric R. Kandel takes us on an enlighting journey ranging from memory, free will, the problem with Freud , to scientific challenges and the rise of European science. Starting with short- and long-term memory basics, underlying molecular mechanisms, and events affecting the formation of long-term memory, Eric Kandel then shares his thoughts on the issue of free will and makes a strong case for its existence. In addition to his outstanding scientific career, Eric Kandel developed an interest in business and today serves as scientific advisor at Memory Pharmaceuticals. Eric Kandel then talks about the use and abuse of drugs in children and the merging of scientific disciplines. In one of the most intriguing parts of the interview, Kandel shares his thoughts on Freud, Freud's mistakes, and the unique situation that the generations following Freud did not develop Freud's work further. The interview then turns to more scientific aspects and Eric Kandel talks about his confidence and courage during the initial phases of his scientific career, studying learning and memory, and employing a strictly reductionistic approach, best characterized by his simple model organism Aplysia. Eric Kandel then describes one of the most challenging phases in his scientific career when adult neurogenesis was discovered in the hippocampus, a structure so integral to Kandel's work. The final parts of the interview cover today's absence of epic battles and controversies and the rise of European science.",

        "Abstract": "To explore how gene products, required for the initiation of synaptic growth, move from the cell body of the sensory neuron to its presynaptic terminals, and from the cell body of the motor neuron to its postsynaptic dendritic spines, we have investigated the anterograde transport machinery in both the sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia. We found that the induction of long-term facilitation (LTF) by repeated applications of serotonin, a modulatory transmitter released during learning in Aplysia, requires upregulation of kinesin heavy chain (KHC) in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Indeed, upregulation of KHC in the presynaptic neurons alone is sufficient for the induction of LTF. However, KHC is not required for the persistence of LTF. Thus, in addition to transcriptional activation in the nucleus and local protein synthesis at the synapse, our studies have identified a third component critical for long-term learning-related plasticity: the coordinated upregulation of kinesin-mediated transport.",

        "Abstract": "Although conditioned inhibition of fear (or learned safety) is a learning process critical for preventing chronic stress, a predisposing factor for depression and other psychopathologies, little is known about its functional purposes or molecular mechanisms. To obtain better insight into learned safety, we investigated its behavioral and molecular characteristics and found that it acts as a behavioral antidepressant in two animal models. Learned safety promotes the survival of newborn cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, while its antidepressant effect is abolished in mice with ablated hippocampal neurogenesis. Learned safety also increases the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus and leads to downregulation of genes involved in the dopaminergic and neuropeptidergic but not the serotonergic system in the basolateral amygdala. These data suggest that learned safety is an animal model of a behavioral antidepressant that shares some neuronal hallmarks of pharmacological antidepressants but is mediated by different molecular pathways.",

        "Title": "Transcriptional regulation of long-term memory in the marine snail Aplysia.",
        "Abstract": "Whereas the induction of short-term memory involves only covalent modifications of constitutively expressed preexisting proteins, the formation of long-term memory requires gene expression, new RNA, and new protein synthesis. On the cellular level, transcriptional regulation is thought to be the starting point for a series of molecular steps necessary for both the initiation and maintenance of long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF). The core molecular features of transcriptional regulation involved in the long-term process are evolutionally conserved in Aplysia, Drosophila, and mouse, and indicate that gene regulation by the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) acting in conjunction with different combinations of transcriptional factors is critical for the expression of many forms of long-term memory. In the marine snail Aplysia, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the storage of long-term memory have been extensively studied in the monosynaptic connections between identified sensory neuron and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex. One tail shock or one pulse of serotonin (5-HT), a modulatory transmitter released by tail shocks, produces a transient facilitation mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase leading to covalent modifications in the sensory neurons that results in an enhancement of transmitter release and a strengthening of synaptic connections lasting minutes. By contrast, repeated pulses of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) induce a transcription- and translation-dependent long-term facilitation (LTF) lasting more than 24 h and trigger the activation of a family of transcription factors in the presynaptic sensory neurons including ApCREB1, ApCREB2 and ApC/EBP. In addition, we have recently identified novel transcription factors that modulate the expression of ApC/EBP and also are critically involved in LTF. In this review, we examine the roles of these transcription factors during consolidation of LTF induced by different stimulation paradigms.",

        "Title": "Chronic nicotine exposure induces a long-lasting and pathway-specific facilitation of LTP in the amygdala.",
        "Abstract": "Nicotine, in the form of tobacco, is the most commonly used drug of abuse. In addition to its rewarding properties, nicotine also affects many cognitive and emotional processes that involve several brain regions, including hippocampus and amygdala. Long-term changes in synaptic strength in these brain regions after drug exposure may be importantly correlated with behavioral changes induced by nicotine. Here, we study the effect of chronic oral administration of nicotine on the long-term synaptic potentiation in the amygdala, a key structure for emotional memory. We find that oral administration of nicotine for 7 d produces a significant enhancement of LTP in the amygdala. This facilitation is pathway specific: Nicotine selectively facilitates LTP in the cortical-lateral amygdala pathway, but not the thalamic-lateral and the lateral-basolateral synaptic pathway. The synaptic facilitation induced by a 7-d exposure to nicotine is long-lasting, it persists for 72 h after cessation of nicotine but decays 8 d after its cessation. In contrast, a shorter exposure of nicotine (24 h) induces only a short-lasting facilitation of synaptic plasticity that dissipates 24 and 72 h after cessation of nicotine. The facilitation of LTP in the amygdala after exposure to nicotine is mediated by removal of GABAergic inhibition, is dependent on the activation NMDA receptors, and can be prevented by blocking either alpha7 or beta2 nACh receptors. Our results indicate that chronic exposure to nicotine can promote the induction of long-lasting modifications of synapses in a specific pathway in the amygdala. These changes in synaptic plasticity may contribute to the complex neural adaptations and behaviors caused by nicotine.",

        "Abstract": "While most studies have focused on the role of long-term potentiation in behavior, far less is known about the role of long-term depression (LTD). To examine the potential involvement of LTD in learning and memory, we generated transgenic mice that express a fragment of the SV40 small t antigen known to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Small t antigen expression blocked both stimulus-induced and chemically induced NMDAR-dependent LTD at Schaffer collateral synapses but did not affect potentiation, depotentiation, or mGluR-dependent LTD. This physiological phenotype was associated with deficits in behavioral flexibility in both the Morris water maze and a delayed nonmatch to place T-maze task, suggesting that NMDAR-dependent LTD is required for behavioral flexibility and may act by weakening previously encoded memory traces when new information is learned.",

        "Abstract": "Synaptic remodeling and synaptic growth accompany various forms of long-term memory. Storage of the long-term memory for sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia has been extensively studied in this respect and is associated with the growth of new synapses by the sensory neurons onto their postsynaptic target neurons. Recent time-lapse imaging studies of living sensory-to-motor neuron synapses in culture have monitored both functional and structural changes simultaneously so as to follow remodeling and growth at the same specific synaptic connections continuously over time and to examine the functional contribution of these learning-related structural changes to the different time-dependent phases of memory storage. Insights provided by these studies suggest the synaptic differentiation and growth induced by learning in the mature nervous system are highly dynamic and often rapid processes that can recruit both molecules and mechanisms used for de novo synapse formation during development.",

        "Abstract": "Activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy are thought to be the key cellular mechanism for the formation and storage of both explicit and implicit memory. Different patterns of stimulation can elicit different changes in the efficiency on excitatory synaptic transmission. Here, we examined the synaptic changes in the amygdala of adult mice produced by low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz, 15 min, LFS). We first compared the synaptic changes induced by LFS in three different synaptic pathways of amygdala: cortical-lateral amygdala, thalamic-lateral amygdala, and lateral-basolateral amygdala pathways. We find that the plastic changes induced by LFS are different between synaptic pathways. Low-frequency stimulation selectively elicits a slow onset and protein synthesis-dependent late-phase LTP in the cortical-lateral amygdala pathway, but not in the thalamic-lateral or lateral-basolateral pathways. We next analyzed LTP induced by LFS in the cortical-lateral amygdala pathway and found that three PKA-coupling neurotransmitter receptors are involved: 5-HT4, Dopamine D1, and beta-adrenergic receptors. Antagonists of these receptors block the LFS L-LTP, but the effects of agonists of these receptors are clearly different. These results indicate that the threshold for the induction of LFS L-LTP is different among these pathways and that the maintenance of LFS L-LTP requires a cross-talk among multiple neurotransmitters.",

        "Abstract": "The amygdala is a critical site for the acquisition of learned fear memory in mammals, and the formation and long-term maintenance of fear memories are thought to be associated with changes of synaptic strength in the amygdala. Here we report that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), a modulatory neurotransmitter known to be linked to learned fearful and emotional behavior, has dual effects on excitatory synaptic transmission in the basolateral amygdala. There is an early depression of synaptic transmission lasting 30-50 min, mediated by 5-HT1A, and a late, long-lasting facilitation lasting >5 h in slice recordings, mediated by the 5-HT4 receptor. 5-HT late phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) is blocked by inhibitors of either protein kinase A (PKA) and/or mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) and requires new protein synthesis and gene transcription. Moreover, the 5-HT-induced L-LTP in neurons of amygdala is blocked by the actin inhibitor cytochalasin D, suggesting that 5-HT stimulates a cytoskeletal rearrangement. These results show, for the first time, that 5-HT can produce long-lasting facilitation of synaptic transmission in the amygdala and provides evidence for the possible synaptic role of 5-HT in long-term memory for learned fear.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular analyses of Aplysia, a well-established model organism for cellular and systems neural science, have been seriously handicapped by a lack of adequate genomic information. By sequencing cDNA libraries from the central nervous system (CNS), we have identified over 175,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), of which 19,814 are unique neuronal gene products and represent 50%-70% of the total Aplysia neuronal transcriptome. We have characterized the transcriptome at three levels: (1) the central nervous system, (2) the elementary components of a simple behavior: the gill-withdrawal reflex-by analyzing sensory, motor, and serotonergic modulatory neurons, and (3) processes of individual neurons. In addition to increasing the amount of available gene sequences of Aplysia by two orders of magnitude, this collection represents the largest database available for any member of the Lophotrochozoa and therefore provides additional insights into evolutionary strategies used by this highly successful diversified lineage, one of the three proposed superclades of bilateral animals.",

        "Abstract": "Much is known about the neurobiology of memory storage for learned fear. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms underlying extinction of fear memory are just beginning to be delineated. Here, we investigate the role of protein kinase A (PKA) in extinction of memory for contextual fear by using conventional and temporally regulated transgenic approaches that allow us to inhibit PKA activity in neurons within brain regions thought to be involved in extinction. Strikingly, reduction of PKA activity facilitated the development of extinction, without interfering with storage of the original fear memory. Moreover, inhibition of PKA facilitated extinction of both recent and remote contextual fear memories. The finding that PKA, which is required for the acquisition of fear memory, is a constraint for extinction provides the first genetic support for the idea that fear extinction is itself a genuine learning process with its own specific molecular requirements, rather than simply the erasure of a previously learned process. Further, these experiments represent the first genetic evidence that protein kinases may be constraints for the extinction of fear.",

In this review, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term forms of implicit memory in the marine invertebrate Aplysia californica, and consider how the conservation of common elements in each form may contribute to the different temporal phases of memory storage.",

        "Abstract": "Protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP (L-LTP) is typically induced by repeated high-frequency stimulation (HFS). This form of L-LTP is reduced in the aged animal and is positively correlated with age-related memory loss. Here we report a novel form of protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampus induced by a brief 1-Hz paired-pulse stimulation (PP-1 Hz, 1 min). In contrast to L-LTP induced by HFS, the late phase of PP-1 Hz LTP does not exist in young adult animals. Rather, it emerges and becomes enhanced in an age-related way. Thus, in 1.5- to 2-mo-old mice, a brief PP-1 Hz stimulation induces only a short lasting LTP, decaying to baseline in about 90 min. By contrast, PP-1 Hz stimulation induces an enduring and protein synthesis dependent LTP in 12- to 18-mo-old mice. The PP-1 Hz-induced L-LTP is dependent on NMDA receptor activation, requires voltage-dependent calcium channels, and is modulated by dopamine D1/D5 receptors. Because memory ability declines with aging, the age-related enhancement of L-LTP induced by PP-1 Hz stimulation indicates that this form of L-LTP appears to be inversely correlated with memory ability.",

        "Abstract": "Dishabituation has been thought to be due either to reversal of the process of habituation or to a second process equivalent to sensitization superimposed on habituation. One way to address this question is by testing whether dishabituation and sensitization can be dissociated. Previous studies using this approach in Aplysia have come to different conclusions about the nature of dishabituation, perhaps because those studies differed in many respects, including (1) whether they also observed transient behavioral inhibition, and (2) whether they used test stimuli that activated the LE siphon sensory neurons or as yet unidentified sensory neurons. To attempt to resolve the apparent contradictions between the previous studies, we have explored the importance of these two factors by performing a parametric study of dishabituation and sensitization of gill withdrawal in a simplified preparation that does not exhibit transient behavioral inhibition, using two different test stimuli that are known to activate the LE (Touch) or unidentified (Not Touch) sensory neurons. We find that dishabituation and sensitization in this preparation have similar time courses and generally similar functions of shock intensity. However, under one condition, with the Not Touch stimulus 2.5 min after the shock, dishabituation has a reverse effect of shock intensity. Additional analyses suggest that dishabituation with the Not Touch stimulus 2.5 min after the shock is due to reversal of habituation, whereas 12.5 min after the shock, dishabituation is due to superimposed sensitization. These results thus suggest that dishabituation may involve either process in the same preparation, and begin to define the conditions that favor one or the other.",

        "Abstract": "Whereas significant insight exists as to how LTP-related changes can contribute to the formation of long-term memory, little is known about the role of hippocampal LTD-like changes in learning and memory storage. We describe a mouse lacking the transcription factor SRF in the adult forebrain. This mouse could not acquire a hippocampus-based immediate memory for a novel context even across a few minute timespan, which led to a profound but selective deficit in explicit spatial memory. These animals were also impaired in the induction of LTD, including LTD triggered by a cholinergic agonist. Moreover, genes regulating two processes essential for LTD-calcium release from intracellular stores and phosphatase activation-were abnormally expressed in knockouts. These findings suggest that for the hippocampus to form associative spatial memories through LTP-like processes, it must first undergo learning of the context per se through exploration and the learning of familiarity, which requires LTD-like processes.",

        "Abstract": "A basic question in neuroscience is how different forms of learning are related. To further address that question, we examined whether gill withdrawal in Aplysia, which has already been studied extensively for neuronal mechanisms contributing to habituation, sensitization, and classical conditioning, also undergoes operant conditioning. Animals were run in pairs. During the initial training period, the contingent (experimental) animal received a siphon shock each time its gill relaxed below a criterion level, and the yoked control animal received a shock whenever the experimental animal did, regardless of its own gill position. This was followed by an extinction period when there was no shock, a retraining period when both animals were contingent, and another extinction period. The experimental animals spent more time with their gills contracted above the criterion level than did the control animals during each period, demonstrating operant conditioning. The type of gill behavior modified by learning shifted over time: the experimental animals had a larger increase in the frequency and duration of spontaneous contractions than did the control animals during the first but not the last extinction period and a larger increase in the level of tonic contraction during the last but not the first extinction period. Because many of the neurons controlling spontaneous and tonic gill withdrawal have already been identified, it should now be possible to examine the cellular locus and mechanism of operant conditioning and compare them with those for other forms of learning of the same behavior.",

To determine directly the behavioral and physiological consequences of increased D2R function in the striatum, we generated mice with reversibly increased levels of D2Rs restricted to the striatum. D2 transgenic mice exhibit selective cognitive impairments in working memory tasks and behavioral flexibility without more general cognitive deficits. The deficit in the working memory task persists even after the transgene has been switched off, indicating that it results not from continued overexpression of D2Rs but from excess expression during development. To determine the effects that may mediate the observed cognitive deficits, we analyzed the prefrontal cortex, the brain structure mainly associated with working memory. We found that D2R overexpression in the striatum impacts dopamine levels, rates of dopamine turnover, and activation of D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex, measures that are critical for working memory.",

        "Abstract": "Studies in the rodent hippocampus have demonstrated that when the late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) is induced in a set of synapses by suprathreshold stimulation, L-LTP can also be expressed by other synapses receiving subthreshold stimulation, a phenomenon usually referred as \"capture of L-LTP.\" Because the pyramidal neurons in the mammalian hippocampus have both apical and basal dendrites, we have now investigated whether capture of L-LTP, previously described only within the apical dendritic compartment, can also take place within the basilar dendritic compartment and, if so, whether capture can be accomplished from one dendritic compartment to the other. We found that capture of L-LTP can also occur within the basilar dendritic compartment and that the tagging signal that enables capture appears to be the same in both dendritic compartments. However, capture across compartments, between the apical and basilar dendrites, follows different rules and requires a stronger triggering stimulation than capture within a compartment. These results suggest that the tag appears specific to a compartment either apical or basilar and that an additional mechanism may be required to capture across compartments.",

        "Abstract": "The late phase of LTP (L-LTP) is typically induced by repeated high-frequency stimulation. This form of LTP requires activation of transcription and translation and results in the cell-wide distribution of gene products that can be captured by other marked synapses. Here we report that theta frequency stimulation (5 Hz, 30 sec) applied to the Schaeffer-collateral pathway can induce a form of late phase of LTP that is restricted locally to the dendritic compartment. The late phase of theta frequency LTP is maintained even in isolated CA1 dendrites and is dependent on dendritic translation and actin cytoskeletal regulation, but is independent of transcription. This local form of L-LTP is not accessible to synaptic capture by other synapses, indicating that this form of LTP is restricted to the synaptic compartment. These results indicate that different patterns of synaptic stimulation can induce distinct forms of LTP that may have different roles in memory storage.",

        "Abstract": "Expression of VP16-CREB, a constitutively active form of CREB, in hippocampal neurons of the CA1 region lowers the threshold for eliciting the late, persistent phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway. This VP16-CREB-mediated L-LTP differs from the conventional late phase of LTP in not being dependent on new transcription. This finding suggests that in the transgenic mice the mRNA transcript(s) encoding the protein(s) necessary for this form of L-LTP might already be present in CA1 neurons in the basal condition. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify the mRNAs differentially expressed in the hippocampus of transgenic and wild-type mice. We then explored the contribution of the most prominent candidate genes revealed by our screening, namely prodynorphin, BDNF, and MHC class I molecules, to the facilitated LTP of VP16-CREB mice. We found that the overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor accounts for an important component of this phenotype.",

        "Abstract": "The synaptic vesicle protein Rab3A is a small GTP-binding protein that interacts with rabphilin and RIM1alpha, two presynaptic substrates of protein kinase A (PKA). Mice lacking RIM1alpha and Rab3A have a defect in PKA-dependent and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-independent presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal mossy-fiber and cerebellar parallel-fiber synapses. In contrast, the NMDAR-dependent and PKA-independent early phase of LTP at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses does not require these presynaptic proteins. Here, we ask whether Rab3A and RIM1alpha participate in forms of LTP that require both PKA and NMDAR activation. We find that Rab3A is necessary for corticoamygdala LTP and late-phase LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses, two forms of LTP that require NMDAR and PKA activation. The latter form of LTP also requires RIM1alpha. These results provide genetic evidence that presynaptic proteins are required in LTP induced through the postsynaptic activation of NMDARs. Thus Rab3A and its effectors are general modules for four distinct types of PKA-dependent LTP in the brain.",

We studied electrophysiological and affective correlates of learned safety by negatively correlating an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) with aversive events (US). This CS came to signify a period of protection, reducing fear responses to predictors of the US and increasing adventurous exploration of a novel environment. In nonaversive conditions, mice turn on the CS when given the opportunity. Thus, conditioned safety involves a reduction of learned and instinctive fear, as well as positive affective responses. Concurrent electrophysiological measurements identified a safety learning-induced long-lasting depression of CS-evoked activity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, consistent with fear reduction, and an increase of CS-evoked activity in a region of the striatum involved in positive affect, euphoric responses, and reward.",

We find that the frequency response curve of synaptic strength induced by prolonged low-frequency stimulation (1-5 Hz) is systematically up-shifted from Shaffer collateral to the CA1-SB pathway. The up-regulation of synaptic strength is mediated by the activity-dependent modulation by beta-adrenergic transmission. Because the CA3-CA1 and the CA1-SB synaptic pathways are in series and the beta-adrenergic modulation is region-specific, this modulation seems to be involved in the selective control of signal transmission between the different regions of hippocampus.",

        "Abstract": "Recent cellular and molecular studies of both implicit and explicit memory storage suggest that experience-dependent modulation of synaptic strength and structure is a fundamental mechanism by which these diverse forms of memory are encoded and stored. For both forms of memory storage, some type of synaptic growth is thought to represent the stable cellular change that maintains the long-term process. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the molecular events that underlie learning-related synaptic growth in Aplysia and discuss the possibility that an active, prion-based mechanism is important for the maintenance of the structural change and for the persistence of long-term memory.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampal formation is critical for the acquisition and consolidation of memories. When recorded in freely moving animals, hippocampal pyramidal neurons fire in a location-specific manner: they are \"place\" cells, comprising a hippocampal representation of the animal's environment. To explore the relationship between place cells and spatial memory, we recorded from mice in several behavioral contexts. We found that long-term stability of place cell firing fields correlates with the degree of attentional demands and that successful spatial task performance was associated with stable place fields. Furthermore, conditions that maximize place field stability greatly increase orientation to novel cues. This suggests that storage and retrieval of place cells is modulated by a top-down cognitive process resembling attention and that place cells are neural correlates of spatial memory. We propose a model whereby attention provides the requisite neuromodulatation to switch short-term homosynaptic plasticity to long-term heterosynaptic plasticity, and we implicate dopamine in this process.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampus is critical for formation of spatial memories. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons in freely behaving animals exhibit spatially selective firing patterns, which taken together form an internal representation of the environment. This representation is thought to contribute to the hippocampal spatial memory system. Behavioral long-term memories differ from short-term memories in requiring the synthesis of new proteins. Does the development of the internal hippocampal representation also require the synthesis of new proteins? We found that blocking protein synthesis in the brain of mice by 95% does not affect short-term stability of newly formed hippocampal place fields but abolishes stability in the long term. By contrast, inhibiting protein synthesis does not affect the retention and recall of previously established fields in a familiar environment, indicating that protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation is not required for recall. Our results indicate that place fields parallel both behavioral memories and the late phase of long-term potentiation in requiring the synthesis of new proteins for consolidation.",

        "Abstract": "To address the role of D1 receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex, we combined pharmacological and genetic manipulations to examine long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP)/long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in brain slices of rats and mice. We found that the D1 antagonist SCH23390 selectively blocked the maintenance but not the induction of LTP in the prefrontal cortex. Conversely, activation of D1 receptors facilitated the maintenance of LTP, and this effect is impaired in heterozygous D1 receptor knockout mice. Low-frequency stimulation induced a transient depression in the medial prefrontal cortex. This depression could be transformed into LTD by coapplication of dopamine. Coapplication of dopamine, however, shows no facilitating effect on LTD in heterozygous D1 receptor knockout mice. These results provide pharmacological and genetic evidence for a role of D1 receptors in the bidirectional modulation of synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex. The absence of this modulation in heterozygous knockout mice shows that a dysregulation of dopamine receptor expression levels can have dramatic effects on synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex.",

        "Title": "A form of long-lasting, learning-related synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus induced by heterosynaptic low-frequency pairing.",
        "Abstract": "The late, transcription- and translation-dependent phase of long-term synaptic potentiation (L-LTP) at the Schaffer collateral synapse of the hippocampus is an experimental model of the synaptic plasticity underlying long-lasting memory formation. L-LTP is typically induced by homosynaptic tetanic stimulation; but associative forms of learning are likely to require the heterosynaptic pairing of stimuli. Here we describe L-LTP elicited by such heterosynaptic pairing at the Schaffer collateral synapse in mice. We find that repeated stimulation of one pathway at low frequency (0.2 Hz), which does not by itself induce synaptic potentiation, will produce long-lasting synaptic plasticity when paired with a brief conditioning burst applied to an independent afferent pathway. The induction of heterosynaptic L-LTP is associative and critically depends on the precise time interval of pairing: simultaneous, conjunctional pairing induces L-LTP; in contrast, delayed pairing induces short-lasting early-phase LTP. Heterosynaptically induced early-phase LTP could be depotentiated by repeatedly presenting unpaired test stimuli, whereas L-LTP could not. This heterosynaptically induced L-LTP requires PKA and protein synthesis. In addition, heterosynaptically induced L-LTP is impaired in transgenic mice that express KCREB (a dominant negative inhibitor of adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate response element-binding protein-mediated transcription) in the hippocampus. These mice have previously been shown to be impaired in spatial memory but have normal L-LTP as induced by a conventional homosynaptic tetanic protocol. These data suggest that at least in some instances this L-LTP-inducing protocol may better model behaviorally relevant information storage and the in vivo mechanisms underlying long-lasting memories.",

In Aplysia, rapamycin-dependent local protein synthesis serves two functions: (1) it provides a component of the mark at the activated synapse and thereby confers synapse specificity and (2) it stabilizes the synaptic growth associated with long-term facilitation. Here we report that a neuron-specific isoform of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) regulates this synaptic protein synthesis in an activity-dependent manner. Aplysia CPEB protein is upregulated locally at activated synapses, and it is needed not for the initiation but for the stable maintenance of long-term facilitation.

When yeast prion proteins switch state, they produce heritable phenotypes. We report prion-like properties in a neuronal member of the CPEB family (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein), which regulates mRNA translation. Compared to other CPEB family members, the neuronal protein has an N-terminal extension that shares characteristics of yeast prion-determinants: a high glutamine content and predicted conformational flexibility. When fused to a reporter protein in yeast, this region confers upon it the epigenetic changes in state that characterize yeast prions. Full-length CPEB undergoes similar changes, but surprisingly it is the dominant, self-perpetuating prion-like form that has the greatest capacity to stimulate translation of CPEB-regulated mRNA. We hypothesize that conversion of CPEB to a prion-like state in stimulated synapses helps to maintain long-term synaptic changes associated with memory storage.",

We try to illustrate this bridging function in two ways. One, we show that many neural scientists study the brain to address humanistically important questions about the mind first raised by classical philosophy. Second, in certain instances the humanities and neural sciences use common methodologies to achieve their respective goals.",

        "Abstract": "To examine the role of C/EBP-related transcription factors in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory storage, we have used the tetracycline-regulated system and expressed in the forebrain of mice a broad dominant-negative inhibitor of C/EBP (EGFP-AZIP), which preferentially interacts with several inhibiting isoforms of C/EBP. EGFP-AZIP also reduces the expression of ATF4, a distant member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors that is homologous to the Aplysia memory suppressor gene ApCREB-2. Consistent with the removal of inhibitory constraints on transcription, we find an increase in the pattern of gene transcripts in the hippocampus of EGFP-AZIP transgenic mice and both a reversibly enhanced hippocampal-based spatial memory and LTP. These results suggest that several proteins within the C/EBP family including ATF4 (CREB-2) act to constrain long-term synaptic changes and memory formation. Relief of this inhibition lowers the threshold for hippocampal-dependent long-term synaptic potentiation and memory storage in mice.",

        "Abstract": "Learning-induced synaptic plasticity commonly involves the interaction between cAMP and p42/44MAPK. To investigate the role of Rap1 as a potential signaling molecule coupling cAMP and p42/44MAPK, we expressed an interfering Rap1 mutant (iRap1) in the mouse forebrain. This expression selectively decreased basal phosphorylation of a membrane-associated pool of p42/44MAPK, impaired cAMP-dependent LTP in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway induced by either forskolin or theta frequency stimulation, decreased complex spike firing, and reduced the p42/44MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of the A-type potassium channel Kv4.2. These changes correlated with impaired spatial memory and context discrimination. These results indicate that Rap1 couples cAMP signaling to a selective membrane-associated pool of p42/44MAPK to control excitability of pyramidal cells, the early and late phases of LTP, and the storage of spatial memory.",

        "Abstract": "Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding (CPEB) proteins control polyadenylation-induced translation in early development. Studies in oocytes led to the delineation of Xenopus CPEB, the first member of the family to be identified, and its mouse homologue mCPEB-1. Recently, a second mouse family member, mCPEB-2, has been described in germ cells. Increasing evidence also implicates CPEB proteins as being important in the hippocampus, where these proteins are thought to regulate local protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity. We therefore carried out a systematic screen for CPEB genes in the mouse brain and report two previously undescribed gene family members: mCPEB-3 and -4. We next examined the expression of all four genes in the hippocampus and found that mCPEB-1, -2, and -4 transcripts are expressed in the principal cell layer in the CA3 and CA1 region and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. mCPEB-3 was barely expressed in naÃ¯ve animals but together with mCPEB-4 was strongly up-regulated after injection of kainate to initiate seizure activity. Whereas mCPEB-1 is regulated by the Aurora kinase, mCPEB-2, -3, and -4 do not contain Aurora kinase phosphorylation sites. However, alternative splice isoforms of mCPEB-2, -3, and -4 encode the so-called B region with phosphorylation sites for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and S6 kinase. Only isoforms that encode the B region were expressed in the principal cell layer. Coexpression of mCPEB-1 and the B region-containing splice isoforms suggests that a variety of different signaling pathways can recruit CPEB activity in hippocampal neurons.",

Long-lasting plasticity has been most extensively studied in the marine snail Aplysia and in the mammalian hippocampus, where Bliss and LÃ¸mo first described long-term potentiation 30 years ago. The molecular mechanisms of plasticity in these two systems have proven to have many similarities. Here, we briefly describe some of these areas of overlap. We then summarize recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of long-lasting synaptic facilitation in Aplysia and suggest that these may prove fruitful areas for future investigation in the mammalian hippocampus and at other synapses in the mammalian brain.",

        "Abstract": "The treatment of memory disorders, such as the gradual weakening of memory with age, the ravages of Alzheimer's disease and the cognitive deficits in various forms of mental retardation, may greatly benefit from a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of memory formation. There is increasing interest in the possibility of pharmacologically enhancing learning and memory even in the absence of specific anatomically evident pathology. Substantial evidence in experimental systems ranging from molluscs to humans indicates that the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a core component of the molecular switch that converts short- to long-term memory. Recent studies have greatly strengthened and refined our understanding of the role of CREB in learning and memory in mammals, in addition to providing greater insight into the molecular mechanisms of CREB regulation and function. This involvement of CREB and the upstream signalling pathways leading to its activation in learning-associated plasticity makes them attractive targets for drugs aimed at improving memory function, in both diseased and healthy individuals. However, CREB and its close relatives cAMP response element modulator and activating transcription factor-1 are ubiquitous proteins with several critical functions. This creates hurdles that the authors believe may limit the usefulness of CREB per se as a target for the development of memory-enhancing drugs, and focus on components of the upstream signalling pathways or on specific downstream targets will be required.",

        "Abstract": "Using a simplified preparation of the Aplysia siphon-withdrawal reflex, we previously found that associative plasticity at synapses between sensory neurons and motor neurons contributes importantly to classical conditioning of the reflex. We have now tested the roles in that plasticity of two associative cellular mechanisms: activity-dependent enhancement of presynaptic facilitation and postsynaptically induced long-term potentiation. By perturbing molecular signaling pathways in individual neurons, we have provided the most direct evidence to date that each of these mechanisms contributes to behavioral learning. In addition, our results suggest that the two mechanisms are not independent but rather interact through retrograde signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Excitatory and inhibitory inputs converge on single neurons and are integrated into a coherent output. Although much is known about short-term integration, little is known about how neurons sum opposing signals for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory storage. In Aplysia, we find that when a sensory neuron simultaneously receives inputs from the facilitatory transmitter 5-HT at one set of synapses and the inhibitory transmitter FMRFamide at another, long-term facilitation is blocked and synapse-specific long-term depression dominates. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that 5-HT induces the downstream gene C/EBP by activating CREB1, which recruits CBP for histone acetylation, whereas FMRFa leads to CREB1 displacement by CREB2 and recruitment of HDAC5 to deacetylate histones. When the two transmitters are applied together, facilitation is blocked because CREB2 and HDAC5 displace CREB1-CBP, thereby deacetylating histones.",

        "Abstract": "CREB is critical for long-lasting synaptic and behavioral plasticity in invertebrates. Its role in the mammalian hippocampus is less clear. We have interfered with CREB family transcription factors in region CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus. This impairs learning in the Morris water maze, which specifically requires the dorsal hippocampus, but not context conditioning, which does not. The deficit is specific to long-term memory, as shown in an object recognition task. Several forms of late-phase LTP are normal, but forskolin-induced and dopamine-regulated potentiation are disrupted. These experiments represent the first targeting of the dorsal hippocampus in genetically modified mice and confirm a role for CREB in hippocampus-dependent learning. Nevertheless, they suggest that some experimental forms of plasticity bypass the requirement for CREB.",

        "Abstract": "Restricted and regulated expression in mice of VP16-CREB, a constitutively active form of CREB, in hippocampal CA1 neurons lowers the threshold for eliciting a persistent late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway. This L-LTP has unusual properties in that its induction is not dependent on transcription. Pharmacological and two-pathway experiments suggest a model in which VP16-CREB activates the transcription of CRE-driven genes and leads to a cell-wide distribution of proteins that prime the synapses for subsequent synapse-specific capture of L-LTP by a weak stimulus. Our analysis indicates that synaptic capture of CRE-driven gene products may be sufficient for consolidation of LTP and provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic tagging and synapse-specific potentiation.",
