Glenoid bone loss can reduce the baseplate back support area and the number of screws for fixation. The purpose of this study is to determine how initial baseplate fixation is affected by biomechanical factors introduced by glenoid bone loss such as reduced baseplate back support area and reduced screw number using three-dimensional finite element analysis.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of obesity in the United States is continuously rising and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Body mass index (BMI) has been used as a risk stratification and counseling tool for patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty in an effort to focus on outcome-driven care. Although the use of BMI cutoffs may have benefits in minimizing complications when selecting patients for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), it may impact access to care for some patient populations and further increase disparities. The purpose of this study is to determine the implications of using BMI cutoffs on the eligibility for TSA among different ethnic and gender patient populations.",

        "Abstract": "The method of surgical incision closure after total shoulder arthroplasty is an important factor to consider, as it affects operating room time, procedure cost, cosmetic outcomes, and patient satisfaction. The optimal method of wound management is unknown, but should be cost-effective, reproducible, and provide a reliable clinical result. This study aimed to compare the following wound closure methods after total shoulder arthroplasty: staples, Dermabond, and Dermabond PRINEO. We hypothesized that wound closure time for Dermabond PRINEO would be faster than Dermabond and comparable to that of staples, and Dermabond PRINEO would be more cost-effective than Dermabond and staples, and provide equal or superior closure outcomes to Dermabond and staples.",

Monoblock polyethylene glenoid components with backside ingrowth or on-growth utilize hybrid fixation, with cementation of the peripheral pegs and central ingrowth or on-growth of bone have been designed to decrease glenoid loosening. However, there is a paucity of midterm data comparing cementation of the peripheral peg holes versus all press-fit implantation for hybrid glenoid constructs. The purpose of this study is to compare the minimum five-year clinical and radiographic outcomes of a press-fit hybrid glenoid component with a peripherally cemented hybrid glenoid component in aTSA.",

        "Abstract": "Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. RAD9 stabilizes the genome, but prostate cancer cells and tumors often have high quantities of the protein. Reduction of RAD9 level within prostate cancer cells decreases tumorigenicity of nude mouse xenographs and metastasis phenotypes in culture, indicating that RAD9 overproduction is essential for the disease. In prostate cancer DU145 cells, CpG hypermethylation in a transcription suppressor site of RAD9 intron 2 causes high-level gene expression. Herein, we demonstrate that DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B are highly abundant in prostate cancer cells DU145, CWR22, LNCaP and PC-3; yet, these DNMTs bind primarily to the transcription suppressor in DU145, the only cells where methylation is critical for RAD9 regulation. For DU145 cells, DNMT1 or DNMT3B shRNA reduced RAD9 level and tumorigenicity, and RAD9 ectopic expression restored this latter activity in the DNMT knockdown cells. High levels of RAD9, DNMT1, DNMT3B and RAD9 transcription suppressor hypermethylation were significantly correlated in prostate tumors, and not in normal prostate tissues. Based on these results, we propose a novel model where RAD9 is regulated epigenetically by DNMT1 and DNMT3B, via targeted hypermethylation, and that consequent RAD9 overproduction promotes prostate tumorigenesis.",

A retrospective review was conducted on twenty-six pateints who underwent staged bilateral aTSA or rTSA, with a minimum of 2 years follow up. Thirteen patients were included in each group, and patient assessed functional outcomes were measured using the PENN Score, ASES, SST, and SF-12. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups for all functional outcome scores, patient satisfaction, or SF-12. These findings suggest that patients undergoing bilateral rTSA can expect functional outcomes similar to those obtained after bilateral aTSA.

        "Abstract": "All-polyethylene tibial (APT) implants were incorporated into the initial design of the first total knee arthroplasty (TKA) systems. Since then, a dynamic shift has taken place and metal-backed tibial (MBT) implants have become the gold standard in TKA. This has mostly been due to the theoretical advantages of intraoperative flexibility and improved biomechanics in addition to the heavy influence of device manufacturers. MBT implant comes not only with a higher cost but also with potential for complications such as osteolysis, backside wear, and thinning of the polyethylene insert, which were not previously seen with APT implant. The majority of studies comparing APT and MBT implants have shown no difference in clinical outcomes and survivorship. Newer studies from the past decade have begun highlighting the economic advantages of APT implant, especially in patients undergoing primary, uncomplicated TKA. Use of APT implants in younger patients and those with a body mass index > 35 has not been extensively studied, but the existing literature suggests the use of APT implant in these cohorts to be equally as acceptable. With modern implant design and instrumentation, rising utilization of TKA along with current and future economic strain on health care, the increased use of APT implant could result in massive savings without sacrificing positive patient outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis is increasing, as is the projected use of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to treat severe cases that fail to respond to conservative measures. Implant designs are either cruciate retaining or posterior stabilized, and while both have high success rates, management of the patella still remains a controversial topic. Although studies indicate that resurfacing the patella provides no significant clinical differences compared with non-resurfacing techniques, surgeons continue to resurface the patella during TKA. Rates of patella resurfacing continue to be as high as 90% in the United States, while European countries tend to favor non-resurfacing techniques. The purpose of this article is to discuss relevant research on patella resurfacing during TKA, to compare the results, and give evidence-based recommendations on how it should be approached going forward.",

        "Abstract": "Scapular notching is a common radiographic finding occurring after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, and it refers to an erosive lesion of the inferior scapular neck because of the impingement of the humeral implant during adduction. The clinical importance of notching is unclear, and the optimal treatment of severe notching is unknown. The incidence and severity of scapular notching is related to prosthetic design and surgical technique. Implant design factors include size, shape, and position of the glenosphere, inclination of the humeral neck-shaft angle, implant offset, and native scapular anatomy. Scapular notching may lead to deterioration of functional outcomes and glenoid implant loosening and failure. Lateral offset, inferior glenosphere overhang, and careful consideration of the presurgical glenoid morphology may help prevent scapular notching. Currently, there is limited evidence to direct the management of scapular notching, and further research is needed to elucidate optimal prevention and treatment strategies.",

Experiments employing genetic overexpression or deletion of Ager (the gene encoding RAGE) or its pharmacological antagonism implicate RAGE in the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated nephropathy. We hypothesized that DIAPH1 contributes to pathological and functional derangements in the kidneys of diabetic mice. We show that DIAPH1 is expressed in the human and murine diabetic kidney, at least in part in the tubulointerstitium and glomerular epithelial cells or podocytes. To test the premise that DIAPH1 is linked to diabetes-associated derangements in the kidney, we rendered male mice globally devoid of Diaph1 ( Diaph1",

Much progress has been made in recent years to understand the underlying genetic basis that drives prostate cancer. Such mechanistic information is useful for development of novel therapeutic targets, to identify biomarkers for early detection or to distinguish between aggressive and indolent disease, and to predict treatment outcome. Multiple tests have become available in recent years to address these clinical needs for prostate cancer. We describe several of these assays, summarizing test details, performance characteristics, and acknowledging their limitations. There is a pressing unmet need for novel biomarkers that can demonstrate improvement in these areas. We introduce one such candidate biomarker, RAD9, describe its functions in the DNA damage response, and detail why it can potentially fill this void. ",

Equally important are other disciplines outlined within is article. Modern psychodynamic publications and presentations should honor all of the foundational pillars of the field.

        "Abstract": "Blood loss management is critical to positive outcomes in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Transfusions are associated with an increased risk of major and minor adverse events, length of hospitalization, and overall cost associated with surgery. Many techniques have been investigated and compared. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic drug widely known to reduce blood loss, may be a bridge to the goal of eliminating blood transfusions from TKA. Administration of TXA can be performed intravenously, topically at the knee joint, orally, or in combination. A single bolus or multiple doses have reduced total blood loss and transfusion rates consistently, safely, and cost-effectively. The uptake in use of TXA by surgeons has been slow due to concerns in patients deemed high risk for thromboembolic events. Newer evidence from studies specifically involving high-risk patients demonstrates that TXA is indeed safe in this cohort and provides benefits that greatly outweigh potential risks. Incorporation of TXA as a routine part of TKA is in the best interest of patients, health care teams, and medical institutions. TXA can be employed seamlessly with other blood saving techniques and has the capacity to increase productivity and decrease overall cost. This can be achieved by reducing the incidence of transfusion and length of stay, and the need for practices such as preoperative anemia treatment and suction drainage.",

        "Abstract": "Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) has become increasingly popular since its introduction to the United States. The purpose of this study was to assess the current trends and use of rTSA, anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA), and hemiarthroplasty (HA) from 2011 to 2014. Shoulder arthroplasty data from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample database were analyzed for the years 2011 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes. For each procedure, use and patient and hospital characteristics were identified. Shoulder arthroplasties increased by 24% between 2011 and 2014, to 79,105 procedures. The proportion of arthroplasties that were aTSA did not change substantially (44% for both years; P=.0585), while the proportion that were rTSA surpassed aTSA in 2014, increasing from 33% to 46% (P<.0001). Use of rTSA topped use of aTSA by 2013 for Medicare patients. The proportion that were HA procedures declined from 23% to 11% (P<.0001). The use of rTSA for fracture increased from 26% to 58% (P<.0001) of all arthroplasties for this indication, while the use of HA for fracture decreased from 69% to 40% (P<.0001). Orthopedists performed rTSA more often than aTSA for Medicare patients by 2013 and the general population by 2014. The use of rTSA for fracture has grown significantly, with rTSA being performed more frequently than HA for this indication. [Orthopedics. 2018; 41(3):e416-e423.].",

        "Abstract": "In this issue of Psychodynamic Psychiatry, Michael Stone discusses therapeutic factors in the treatment of patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). He emphasizes the great diversity of borderline patients and points out that a number of manual-based therapies, each described by an acronym, generally achieve positive therapeutic results in the short term. Many borderline patients require years of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and additional treatments, however. Stone observes that patients with this disorder invariably have other personality characteristics and disorders. Suicidality is common among borderline patients, particularly those who also suffer from major depressive episodes. Stone emphasizes the usefulness of a contextual therapeutic model and a flexible clinical stance.",

Subjects were outpatients treated with drugs and psychotherapy in routine office practice. Differences in sexual behavior between the two groups as a whole were minimal, but meaningful differences emerged when subgroups were compared. Compared to control men, Bipolar men had had more partners in the last year and were more likely to have had sex without condoms. Compared to Bipolar females, Bipolar males had more sex partners, had more sex with strangers, and were more likely to have engaged in homosexual behavior. Even so, some patients in the Comparison group also had engaged in risky sexual behavior. They had failed to use condoms and had had sex with strangers and prostitutes during the previous year.",

        "Abstract": "Anticoagulant medications help to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events after total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. Traditionally, this has been accomplished with medications, such as low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin. However, these traditional anticoagulants possess a variety of shortcomings that leave much room for improvement. A new class of oral anticoagulants is now available, and present a more convenient option for safe and efficacious thromboprophylaxis in post arthroplasty patients, particularly in the outpatient setting. This review focuses on the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and the selective factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, and the clinical data to date about their use in total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty patients.",

        "Abstract": "Preparticipation screening for unsuspected cardiovascular disease is a controversial topic in the medical and lay communities. Much attention has been directed towards young competitive athletes, particularly the proposed strategy of incorporating 12-lead electrocardiograms into the screening process, even on a national or worldwide basis. However, sudden deaths of young athletes owing to genetic or congenital heart diseases have a low incidence in the general population. Furthermore, young people not engaged in competitive sports can harbour the same conditions that cause sudden death in athletes, which has gone largely unrecognized. Notably, sudden deaths from these diseases are numerically far more common in the much larger population of nonathletes. In this Perspectives article, we propose that an ethical dilemma has emerged, raising the important public-health issue of whether young individuals should be arbitrarily excluded from potentially life-saving clinical screening evaluations because they do not engage in competitive sports programmes.",

        "Title": "Sexual differentiation of childhood play: a contemporary psychoanalytic perspective.",
        "Abstract": "Freud (1905/1953) anchored his theories of unconscious psychological functioning in observations and inferences about childhood sexuality. These ideas remain influential among psychoanalysts today. Much progress subsequently occurred in extra-psychoanalytic research in human sexuality. This included the discovery in 1959 of an entirely new area of psychology: the sexual differentiation of behavior (Phoenix, Goy, Gerall, & Young, 1959; Wallen, 2009). The observations that led to this new field originally concerned the effects of androgen administered prenatally to non-human animals. This early research was compatible with later studies of humans as well. Prenatal androgen influences both erotic and non-erotic behavior, including childhood rough-and-tumble play (RTP). We have previously emphasized the need to integrate this psychoneuroendocrine knowledge with psychoanalytic theory and practice (Friedman, 1988; Friedman & Downey, 2002, 2008a, 2008b). In this article, we discuss additional aspects of the relationship between sexually differentiated childhood play, particularly RTP, and gender differences in psychosexual development and functioning. These topics and other aspects of the sexual differentiation of behavior have been under-emphasized in psychoanalytic thought.",

        "Title": "Is increased sexual behavior a symptom of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents?",
        "Abstract": "While there is consensus that bipolar disorder exists in children and adolescents, its diagnostic criteria are debated. Excessive sexual behavior has been reported in youth who may have juvenile bipolar disorder (JBD), and has been termed \"hypersexuality.\" Although there is no universal definition of this term, this observation has led to a hypothesis that increased sexual behavior characterizes the bipolar syndrome in children and adolescents, and differentiates it from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although this hypothesis is plausible, evidence for it is incomplete, because testing it definitively would require both establishing a standard definition of hypersexuality in children and adolescents, and also reaching consensus about the other nonsexual criteria for pediatric bipolar disorder. In addition, studies to test it would need to control factors other than JBD that are known to increase sexual behavior in children and adolescents. These include sexual abuse and related posttraumatic stress disorder, excessive exposure to sexual stimuli, psychiatric illness in general, and social variables such as family chaos and social stress. Some of these factors might increase sexual behavior in youth with bipolar disorder through psychodynamic mechanisms rather than as a result of the illness itself. Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether increased sexual behavior can serve as a diagnostically valuable criterion for bipolar disorder in children and adolescents, and whether it differentiates the disorder from other conditions known to be associated with increased sexual behavior in youth.",

        "Abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD), particularly when it affects a child or a young athlete who is presumed to be healthy, is an emotionally charged event that has a widespread impact. An effective ECG screening strategy for this population is intuitively appealing. The primary objective of ECG screening is to detect occult cardiovascular conditions likely to manifest with SCD. Such an endeavor is only effective if it is highly sensitive with an acceptably low false-positive rate. It also must be accompanied by an intervention that reduces the risk of SCD and improves outcomes. Despite significant advancements, considerable knowledge gaps remain about the etiology of SCD and the frequency with which SCD occurs. Reports of screening programs that have reduced the incidence of SCD have limited generalizability based on program design and the populations studied. Within the USA, considerable gaps in knowledge exist related to the frequency of SCD in youth and to the incremental predictive value of an ECG when added to a standardized history and physical examination. The strategy of ECG screening of young populations needs careful consideration based on principles of effective screening and evidence-based medicine. From a health policy perspective, additional data are needed from robust registries and carefully designed trials before advancing ECG screening in youth.",

        "Abstract": "Recent psychiatric literature has used the term \"hypersexuality\" to denote pathologically increased sexual behavior in children and adolescents. Various patterns of increased sexuality have been described in youth, including sexuality that is excessive, developmentally precocious, compulsive, aggressive, or otherwise socially inappropriate. Such \"hypersexual\" behavior in children and adolescents is associated with a variety of factors. Social factors include sexual abuse, physical abuse, life stress, and impaired family relationships. Psychiatric factors include emotional and behavioral problems in general, posttraumatic stress disorder and dissociative symptoms in particular, and possibly bipolar disorder. Despite the importance of increased sexual behavior in youth as a possible sign of these problems, there is currently no uniform definition in psychiatric literature of the term \"hypersexuality\" applied to children and adolescents. The usefulness of this term depends upon the degree to which it can be defined, measured, and distinguished from non-pathological juvenile sexual behavior. Research instruments are described that may be useful in measuring levels of sexual behavior in children and adolescents. Elements of a definition of juvenile hypersexuality are proposed based upon current knowledge about children and adolescents' sexuality in both normal development and a variety of conditions in which it is increased. Care is warranted in distinguishing between normal and abnormal sexual behavior in youth because of the variety of factors that can affect its measurement.",

        "Abstract": "Patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty should receive anticoagulant therapy because of the high risk of venous thromboembolism. However, many are already taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) that can have antihaemostatic effects. We assessed the bleeding risk in patients treated with thromboprophylactic dabigatran etexilate, with and without concomitant NSAID or ASA. A post-hoc analysis was undertaken of the pooled data from trials comparing dabigatran etexilate (220 mg and 150 mg once daily) and enoxaparin. Major bleeding event (MBE) rates were determined and odds ratios (ORs) generated for patients who received study treatment plus NSAID (half-life ≤12 hours) or ASA (≤160 mg/day) versus study treatment alone. Relative risks were calculated for comparisons between treatments. Overall, 4,405/8,135 patients (54.1%) received concomitant NSAID and 386/8,135 (4.7%) received ASA.ORs for the comparison with/without concomitant NSAID were 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-2.01) for 220 mg dabigatran etexilate; 1.19 (0.55-2.55) for 150 mg; and 1.32 (0.67-2.57) for enoxaparin. ORs for the comparison with/without ASA were 1.14 (0.26-5.03); 1.64 (0.36-7.49); and 2.57 (0.83-7.94), respectively. For both NSAIDs and ASA there was no significant difference in bleeding between patients with and without concomitant therapy in any treatment arm. Patients concomitantly taking NSAIDs or ASA have a similar risk of MBE to those taking dabigatran etexilate alone. No significant differences in MBE were detected between dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin within co-medication subgroups, suggesting that no increased major bleeding risk exists when dabigatran etexilate is administered with NSAID or ASA.",

        "Abstract": "We have measured the dose dependence of the degree of amorphization of titanite, CaTiSiO(5). Titanite is an often metamict mineral which has been considered as a matrix for the encapsulation of radiogenic waste, such as Pu. The amorphous fraction p of geologically irradiated samples (ages between 0.3 and 1 Ga) follows p = 1 - exp(-B(a)D) where D is the total dose and the characteristic amorphization mass is B(a) = 2.7(3) × 10(-19) g. Amorphization follows the direct impact mechanism where each α-decay leads to a recoil of the radiogenic atoms (mostly Th and U), which then, in turn, displaces some 5000 atoms of the titanite matrix. The amorphization behaviour is almost identical with that of zircon, ZrSiO(4), which has a similar molecular mass. While the recrystallization mechanism and elastic behaviour of the two minerals are very different, we do not find significant differences for the amorphization mechanism. Our samples have undergone little reheating over their geological history, since heating over 800 K would lead to rapid recrystallization for which we have found no evidence.",

Trials of the new oral direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran indicate that they can be administered in fixed doses without monitoring and that they generally have efficacy at least equivalent to enoxaparin, although with potential minor differences in the balance of efficacy vs risk for bleeding.

        "Title": "Electrophysiology issues in adult congenital heart disease.",
        "Abstract": "Improved surgical outcomes in children have led to a growing population of adults with congenital heart disease. Rhythm disturbances in the adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patient can be intrinsic to the anomaly or acquired after palliation. Tachyarrhythmias, either supraventricular or ventricular, and bradyarrhythmias, either sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block, may occur frequently. Technological advances in intervention and surgical approaches have led to prophylactic and therapeutic reduction in arrhythmias. In order of escalation, this article addresses medical management, catheter ablation, device therapy for antitachycardia pacing and defibrillation, and surgical intervention. There are now an estimated one million-plus ACHD patients living in the United States. An estimated 45% of those have simple defects (e.g., atrial septal defects), 40% have moderately complex defects (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot, or ToF), and 15% have severely complex defects (e.g., single ventricle anatomy or surgical palliations for transposition of the great arteries [TGA]). The moderate and severe categories have a high incidence of arrhythmia. Of older repaired ToF patients, 34% develop symptomatic atrial or supraventricular tachycardias, 8.5% develop high-grade ventricular tachycardia (VT), and there are an increasing number of implantable defibrillators due to a sudden-death estimate of 2% per decade. Thus, an estimated 50,000 adults with repaired ToF will require electrophysiology follow-up with 100 sudden deaths per year nationally. Roughly 3% of all congenital heart surgeries requiring cardiopulmonary bypass have post-operative AV block, and 1% will require permanent pacing. Older atriopulmonary Fontans have up to an estimated 50% incidence of atrial tachycardia within a decade of palliation due to suture lines and elevated atrial pressures. Patients who have undergone an atrial switch operation (e.g., Mustard or Senning operations) are rarely exclusively in sinus rhythm a decade after repair, thus posing problems for rhythm control and anticoagulation. Catheter ablation in congenital heart disease is often more challenging than structurally normal hearts because of abnormal anatomy (congenital and/or post-surgical) and thicker chamber walls due to unfavorable hemodynamics. In preparation, review of noninvasive imaging, previous catheterization angiography, and surgical palliation reports are paramount prior to a procedure. Fortunately, to meet the growing challenge, newer software with 3-D packages allow for improved mapping. In addition, advances with larger-tipped and irrigated-tip catheters allow for deeper, more effective lesions to be placed. Several advances in surgical approach have led to a reduction in arrhythmias. For example, the arterial switch operation for d-transposition of the great arteries instead of the aforementioned atrial switch operation eliminates the use of a systemic right ventricle that can later develop intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia and sinus node dysfunction. Other advances include paying careful attention to minimizing ventriculotomies in ToF and ventricular septal defect (VSD) repairs, earlier complete repairs, and valve sparing to reduce pulmonary insufficiency. Finally, completion of the extra-cardiac Fontan procedure (e.g., total cavopulmonary connection) for single ventricles avoids extensive suture lines in the right atrium, thereby reducing scarring and higher pressures that lead to IART and sinus node dysfunction. Extracardiac (EC) conduits and lateral tunnel (LT) Fontans are preferred today, and the Fontan conversion procedure (converting prior atriopulmonary Fontans to the EC or LT type) can be performed to reduce arrhythmia and thromboembolic events.",

        "Abstract": "The number of total hip and knee arthroplasties is increasing, with a consequent rise in the number of patients at risk of venous thromboembolism. Each such event is associated with the risk of morbidity and mortality, plus substantial healthcare costs. Consequently, the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend low-molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux or vitamin K antagonists (usually warfarin) after total hip and knee arthroplasty. However, such agents are also associated with healthcare costs for administration and monitoring. New oral anticoagulants in development may reduce post-arthroplasty symptomatic thromboembolic events and produce potential savings for the healthcare system. This brief article outlines such potential savings with rivaroxaban based on the results of the REgulation of Coagulation in ORthopaedic surgery to prevent Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (RECORD) program.",

        "Abstract": "The Global Orthopaedic Registry (GLORY) offers insights into multinational practice patterns of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery, based on data from 15,020 patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty or primary total hip arthroplasty from 2001 to 2004. Registry data show that the first choice for in-hospital VTE prophylaxis was low-molecular-weight heparin. Multimodal prophylaxis was common. Warfarin was more widely used in the USA than elsewhere in the world. GLORY data suggest that real-world practice often fails to meet the standards for prophylaxis recommended in the American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based guidelines, particularly in the USA. However, many US orthopedic surgeons may follow other practice guidelines, causing an underestimation of prophylaxis us in this study. Warfarin in the USA often failed to achieve recommended target International Normalized Ratio (INR) values. This paper reviews the GLORY practice findings in light of the contemporary literature on best practices for VTE prophylaxis in orthopedic patients.",

        "Title": "Use of a cardioselective beta-blocker for pediatric patients with prolonged QT syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "The data on the efficacy of atenolol for long-QT syndrome (LQTS) are controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of atenolol for pediatric patients with LQTS. A retrospective observational study investigating all patients who had LQTS treated with atenolol at two institutions was performed. The study identified 57 patients (23 boys and 34 girls) with a mean QT corrected for heart rate (QTc) of 521 ± 54 ms. The mean age of these patients at diagnosis was 9 ± 6 years. Their clinical manifestations included no symptoms (n = 33, 58%), ventricular tachycardia (n = 10, 18%), syncope (n = 6, 10%), resuscitated sudden cardiac death (n = 4, 7%), atrioventricular block (n = 2, 4%), and bradycardia or presyncope (n = 2, 3%). Of the 57 patients, 13 (22%) had a family history of sudden death. The follow-up period was 5.4 ± 4.5 years. Atenolol at a mean dose of 1.4 ± 0.5 mg/kg/day was administered twice a day for all the patients. The mean maximum heart rate was 132 ± 27 bpm on Holter monitors and 155 ± 16 bpm on exercise treadmill tests, with medication doses titrated up to achieve a maximum heart rate lower than 150 bpm on both tests. During the follow-up period, one patient died (noncompliant with atenolol at the time of death), and the remaining patients had no sudden cardiac death events. Four patients (8%) had recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, three of whom received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (all symptomatic at the time of diagnosis). For three patients (6%), it was necessary to rotate to a different beta-blocker because of side effects or inadequate heart rate control. Atenolol administered twice daily constitutes a valid and effective alternative for the treatment of pediatric patients with LQTS.",

        "Abstract": "Patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty often sustain significant decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit, despite modern techniques and shorter operating times. Reasons for the blood loss include raw bony surfaces, vascular inflammatory tissue, and fragile vessels in elderly patients. Acute postoperative anemia has numerous deleterious effects on patients, including delayed rehabilitation, exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions, higher complication rates, and increased pain. The ability to limit the amount of postoperative bleeding may reduce the amount of postoperative pain that patients experience, ultimately resulting in greater patient satisfaction and smoother postoperative rehabilitation. This article focuses on intraoperative techniques available to limit bleeding, thereby minimizing pain and the need for postoperative transfusion.",

The long-term sequelae of VTE, such as post-thrombotic syndrome or pulmonary hypertension, can be debilitating with severe morbidity. Conventional anticoagulants have several short-comings: for example, warfarin requires regular coagulation monitoring and low-molecular-weight heparins are inconvenient to use because they require subcutaneous administration. The development of new anticoagulants has focused on 2 classes of compounds: direct thrombin inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors. These new oral agents have shown efficacy in large randomized clinical trials and offer new, more convenient options for anticoagulation.",

However, in a large number of cases adequate administration of thromboprophylaxis does not seem to occur after total joint arthroplasty. A major challenge in the management of thromboprophylaxis is to balance the benefits of treatment with the risks, including bleeding complications. Another potential barrier to the optimal use of thromboprophylaxis could be the inconvenience of currently available agents. Many surgeons therefore adopt a conservative approach towards thromboprophylaxis. Simplifying therapy with more convenient, efficacious, and safe anticoagulants could change attitudes to anticoagulant use and improve adherence to thromboprophylactic guidelines.",

The international literature offers few reports of synchronous or metachronous volvulus of 2 organs of the gastrointestinal tract. We describe a unique case of a patient who presented with recurrent metachronous volvulus of the sigmoid colon, cecum, and stomach. The patient underwent multiple operations for bowel obstruction, lysis of adhesions, and colon resection. The interesting intraoperative findings were a very long mesentery and peritoneal attachments of the intraabdominal gastrointestinal organs that made the stomach and colon extremely mobile and thus susceptible to volvulus. Prophylactic pexis of the cecum and the stomach during the first operation, in light of the elongated mesentery, may have prevented the subsequent episodes of volvulus.",

        "Abstract": "The prognosis in children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) is guarded, with the 5-year mortality rate ranging from 14% to 50%, owing to sudden cardiac death (SCD) or pump failure. The risk factors for SCD in adults with IDC include asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and poor left ventricular function. It is unclear whether these findings can be extrapolated to the pediatric population. A retrospective review of all patients with the diagnosis of IDC seen at a single institution from 1990 to 2004 was performed. A total of 85 patients (46 males), with a median age of 3.8 years (0 days to 17.3 years) were studied. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 25 +/- 12% (median 23%, range 45% to 45%) at presentation. The following arrhythmias occurred at presentation or during the initial hospitalization: nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 6, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in 1, supraventricular arrhythmias in 6, and both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in 1. During a subsequent hospitalization or outpatient follow-up, 7 patients had the following arrhythmias: supraventricular arrhythmias in 2, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 4, and both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in 1. The cumulative survival rate was 40% at a mean follow-up of 6.2 years (95% confidence interval 4.4 to 8.1). One single episode of SCD occurred in 1 patient without a history of sustained arrhythmias. In conclusion, in children with IDC, despite the low left ventricular ejection fraction and presence of ventricular arrhythmias, only one episode of SCD occurred in this group of patients. Given the 1% incidence of SCD in this cohort, the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators as primary prevention in children with IDC might not be indicated.",

        "Title": "Dabigatran etexilate: pivotal trials for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after hip or knee arthroplasty.",
        "Abstract": "Dabigatran etexilate, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was investigated in 3 large phase III trials for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip arthroplasty (RE-NOVATE, N = 3494) or total knee arthroplasty (RE-MODEL, N = 2076 and RE-MOBILIZE, N = 2615). RE-NOVATE and RE-MODEL were conducted mainly in Europe, and RE-MOBILIZE was conducted predominantly in the United States and Canada. This review discusses the results of these trials. In all 3 trials, 2 doses, 220 mg and 150 mg once daily, were compared with enoxaparin. Both RE-MODEL and RE-NOVATE demonstrated noninferiority for the primary outcome (a composite of total VTE events and all-cause mortality), P = .0003 and P < .0001, respectively, for these trials. In 2008, these data formed the basis for European and Canadian approval. While RE-MOBILIZE did not demonstrate noninferiority for the primary outcome (25.3% for enoxaparin vs 31.1% for 220 mg, risk difference +5.8%, 95% CI, 0.8-10.8; P = .02 and 33.7% for 150 mg, risk difference +8.4%, 95% CI, 3.4-13.3; P = .0009), both treatments were similar for the secondary composite outcome (major VTE plus VTErelated mortality; 3.4% with 220 mg, 3.0% with 150 mg, and 2.2% with enoxaparin) and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (0.8%, 0.7%, and 0.6%). There were no differences in the bleeding rates, hepatic enzyme elevations, or acute coronary syndrome events between the 2 treatments. With the practical advantages of once-daily oral dosing, dabigatran etexilate can be considered an attractive alternative to conventional thromboprophylaxis regimens in patients undergoing elective total hip and knee arthroplasty.",

        "Abstract": "Bordetella bronchiseptica can establish prolonged airway infection consistent with a highly developed ability to evade mammalian host immune responses. Upon initial interaction with the host upper respiratory tract mucosa, B. bronchiseptica are subjected to antimicrobial reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), effector molecules of the innate immune system. However, the responses of B. bronchiseptica to redox species at physiologically relevant concentrations (nM-microM) have not been investigated. Using predicted physiological concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on low numbers of CFU of B. bronchiseptica, all redox active species displayed dose-dependent antimicrobial activity. Susceptibility to individual redox active species was significantly increased upon introduction of a second species at subantimicrobial concentrations. An increased bacteriostatic activity of NO was observed relative to H2O2. The understanding of Bordetella responses to physiologically relevant levels of exogenous RNS and ROS will aid in defining the role of endogenous production of these molecules in host innate immunity against Bordetella and other respiratory pathogens.",

        "Abstract": "The human serine protease inhibitor (serpin) gene cluster at 14q32.1 comprises 11 serpin genes, many of which are expressed specifically in hepatic cells. Previous studies identified a locus control region (LCR) upstream of the human alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT) gene that is required for gene activation, chromatin remodeling, and histone acetylation throughout the proximal serpin subcluster. Here we show that the LCR interacts with multiple liver-specific transcription factors, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta (HNF-3beta), HNF-6alpha, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), and C/EBPbeta. RNA polymerase II is also recruited to the locus through the LCR. Nongenic transcription at both the LCR and an upstream regulatory region was detected, but the deletion of the LCR abolished transcription at both sites. The deletion of HNF-3 and HNF-6 binding sites within the LCR reduced histone acetylation at both the LCR and the upstream regulatory region and decreased the transcription of the alpha1AT, corticosteroid binding globulin, and protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor genes. These results suggest that the LCR activates genes in the proximal serpin subcluster by recruiting liver-specific transcription factors and components of the general transcription machinery to regulatory regions upstream of the alpha1AT gene.",

        "Abstract": "At its inception, psychoanalytic psychology heavily emphasized sexuality. Freud's ideas about the centrality of sexuality in development and in the etiology of psychopathology were accepted for many years by organized psychoanalysis and psychiatry. Modern psychoanalytic theory has replaced sexuality as an organizing concept with diverse paradigms and the field has fragmented as a result. Of the many theories that Freud posed about the role of sexuality in psychological functioning perhaps his most influential were those pertaining to the Oedipus complex. In this, the first article of a series on the psychodynamic aspects of human sexuality, Oedipal aggression in males is considered from a biopsychosocial perspective. Knowledge about sexual differentiation of the brain and sex differences in behavior resulting from research carried out after Freud's death suggests the need to revise Freud's ideas about the Oedipus complex.",

        "Abstract": "The Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) is a roadmap and tool-kit for States to transform their Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) into an enterprise-wide, beneficiary-centric system. MITA will enable State Medicaid agencies to align their information technology (IT) opportunities with their evolving business needs. It also addresses long-standing issues of interoperability, adaptability, and data sharing, including clinical data, across organizational boundaries by creating models based on nationally accepted technical standards. Perhaps most significantly, MITA allows State Medicaid Programs to actively participate in the DHHS Secretary's vision of a transparent health care market that utilizes electronic health records (EHRs), ePrescribing and personal health records (PHRs).",

        "Abstract": "Valve lesions in degenerative calcific aortic stenosis (CAS), a disorder affecting 3% of those older than 75 years, are infiltrated by T lymphocytes. We sought to determine whether the alphabeta TCR repertoire of these valve-infiltrating lymphocytes exhibited features either of a polyclonal nonselective response to inflammation or contained expanded clones suggesting a more specific immune process. TCR beta-chain CDR3-length distribution analysis using PCR primers specific for 23 Vbeta families performed in eight individuals with CAS affecting tri- or bileaflet aortic valves revealed considerable oligoclonal T cell expansion. In five cases, beta-chain nucleotide sequencing in five selected Vbeta families showed that an average of 92% of the valve-infiltrating T cell repertoire consisted of expanded T cell clones, differing markedly in composition from the relatively more polyclonal peripheral CD8 or CD4 T cell subsets found even in this elderly population. Twenty-four of the valve-infiltrating T cell clones also had the same clone identified in blood, some of which were highly expanded. Interestingly, 22 of these 24 shared clones were CD8 in lineage (p = 1.5 x 10(-12)), suggesting a possible relationship to the expanded CD8(+)CD28(-) T cell clones frequently present in the elderly. Additionally, the sequences of several TCR beta-chain CDR3 regions were homologous to TCR beta-chains identified previously in allograft arteriosclerosis. We infer that these findings are inconsistent with a nonselective secondary response of T cells to inflammation and instead suggest that clonally expanded alphabeta T cells are implicated in mediating a component of the valvular injury responsible for CAS.",

        "Abstract": "During the 1960s, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) emerged as a widely popular drug, used by a substantial portion of the adolescent and young adult population. Since Major Depressive Disorder is a common disorder, clinicians will increasingly encounter patients who used LSD in the far distant past and now require treatment with antidepressant agents. We describe such a case in the following report of a patient who experienced a troubling array of unusual side effects, which we postulate to be a new onset LSD flashback syndrome triggered by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).",

        "Abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is responsible for nearly 3 million human deaths worldwide every year. Understanding the mechanisms and bacterial factors responsible for the ability of M. tuberculosis to cause disease in humans is critical for the development of improved treatment strategies. Many bacterial pathogens use pili as adherence factors to colonize the host. We discovered that M. tuberculosis produces fine (2- to 3-nm-wide), aggregative, flexible pili that are recognized by IgG antibodies contained in sera obtained from patients with active tuberculosis, indicating that the bacilli produce pili or pili-associated antigen during human infection. Purified M. tuberculosis pili (MTP) are composed of low-molecular-weight protein subunits encoded by the predicted M. tuberculosis H37Rv ORF, designated Rv3312A. MTP bind to the extracellular matrix protein laminin in vitro, suggesting that MTP possess adhesive properties. Isogenic mtp mutants lost the ability to produce Mtp in vitro and demonstrated decreased laminin-binding capabilities. MTP shares morphological, biochemical, and functional properties attributed to bacterial pili, especially with curli amyloid fibers. Thus, we propose that MTP are previously unidentified host-colonization factors of M. tuberculosis.",

        "Abstract": "Elective total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty are associated with a high risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism. Traditionally, antithrombotic prophylaxis has been administered during the hospital stay. However, with patients spending less time in the hospital after surgery, there is a need to continue thromboprophylaxis beyond hospital discharge. The current recommendation for prophylaxis in total joint arthroplasty patients is a minimum of 10 days, with extended prophylaxis up to 28 to 35 days following total hip arthroplasty. Prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins for approximately 4 weeks following hip arthroplasty has resulted in clinically significant reductions in the incidence of venographically confirmed deep vein thrombosis. Currently, no data support extended thromboprophylaxis beyond 10 days following total knee arthroplasty. Using weighted risk factors to assess individual risk for venous thromboembolism can help the physician determine the optimal duration of prophylaxis.",

        "Abstract": "The eis gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been shown to play a role in the survival of the avirulent Mycobacterium smegmatis within the macrophage. In vitro and in vivo analysis of Deltaeis deletion mutants and complemented strains showed no effect on survival of M. tuberculosis in U-937 macrophages or in a mouse aerosol infection model, respectively. Further studies were done in an attempt to determine the role of eis in M. tuberculosis intracellular survival and to define a phenotypic difference between wild-type and the Deltaeis deletion mutant. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that Eis is an acetyltransferase of the GCN5-related family of N-acetyltransferases. Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis studies demonstrated that Eis is released into the cytoplasm of M. tuberculosis-infected U-937 macrophages. Eis was also found in the extravesicular fraction and culture supernatant of M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages. The effect of Eis on human macrophage cytokine secretion was also examined. Eis modulated the secretion of IL-10 and TNF-alpha by primary human monocytes in response both to infection with M. tuberculosis and to stimulation with recombinant Eis protein. These results suggest that Eis is a mycobacterial effector that is released into the host cell to modulate inflammatory responses, possibly via transcriptional or post-translational means.",

        "Abstract": "At this point in the history of psychiatry it is important for psychodynamic psychiatry to strengthen its identity as a discipline in its own right-distinct from organized psychoanalysis. Although some of its principles overlap with psychoanalytic psychology, there are important differences. Psychodynamic psychiatry places a greater emphasis on immediate therapeutic outcome. It has a much wider patient base, and flexible models of duration and frequency of treatment. Its assumptions also rest on scientifically validated data to a much larger degree than psychoanalysis. A sturdier identity might help psychodynamic psychiatry stand alongside bio-descriptive psychiatry as a core component of American Psychiatry.",

        "Abstract": "Several training programs in biomedical informatics in the United States are attempting to integrate biological and clinical informatics. However, significant differences in the cultures underlying these two disciplines pose barriers to a uniform educational solution. This paper recounts the experience at Columbia University in adapting a graduate program with an initial focus on clinical informatics to train bioinformaticians. The analysis begins by considering the development of the medical and biological informatics cultures over a 17-year period. Then we review how two separate curricula evolved to serve the needs of each group. Interviews with bioinformatics students and faculty indicated some dissatisfaction with the curriculum that developed within clinical informatics. Their comments are considered in the light of an analysis of the relationship between the application domains of biomedical informatics as a discipline. In response, a new curriculum was developed in which bioinformatics and clinical informatics are regarded as subdivisions of the same subject. A key feature of this curriculum is a new course, Theory and Methods in Biomedical Informatics, which presents informatics principles in their general form, and illustrates their application with examples drawn from across the biomedical spectrum. The paper concludes with suggestions for integrating informatics training programs at other institutions.",

Of these patients, 44% had been prescribed psychotropic medication on a daily basis for at least 2 weeks during the present treatment. Patients treated for the longest time (5 years or more) were the most seriously psychiatrically disturbed. Patients improved with psychotherapy, and the improvement was related to the duration of treatment. The combined impact of diagnosis status, treatment duration, and treatment modalities provided a consistent pattern of treatment effectiveness.",

After listening to an RT audiotape or music audiotapes daily for 6 weeks, the acute central nervous system effects of RT and music were measured using power spectral analysis of alpha and theta EEG activity in all cortical regions. RT produced significantly greater increases in theta activity in multiple cortical regions compared to the music condition. These findings are consistent with widespread reductions in cortical arousal during RT. They extend previous findings and suggest that theta, and not alpha, EEG may be the most reliable marker of the central nervous system effects of RT. These findings demonstrate that RT produce greater reductions in central nervous system activity than a credible comparison condition. The findings suggest that RT represent a hypoactive central nervous system state that may be similar to Stage 1 sleep and that RT may exert their therapeutic effects, in part, through cerebral energy conservation/restoration.",

        "Abstract": "Reporter systems efficient at monitoring temporal gene expression in slow-growing mycobacteria would significantly aid the characterization of gene expression in specific environments. Bacterial luciferase is a reporter that has not been widely used to study gene expression in mycobacteria. This report describes the determination of the degradation of bacterial luciferase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra and its utility as a reporter of temporal gene expression in this slow-growing mycobacterium. The inducible/repressible alanine dehydrogenase promoter of M. tuberculosis H37Rv was used to track the decay kinetics of Vibrio harveyi luciferase in both mid-log phase and stationary phase grown M. tuberculosis H37Ra, which proved to be highly similar during both phases of growth. The luciferase reporter was then used to detect changes in expression from the heat-shock promoter, phsp60, of M. bovis BCG during M. tuberculosis H37Ra growth in culture. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of groEL2, the hsp60 homologue in M. tuberculosis, displayed a similar pattern of expression to phsp60-driven luciferase. These results strongly suggest that the luciferase reporter can be used to monitor temporal changes in gene expression in M. tuberculosis and may serve as a novel system to examine gene expression under specific conditions.",

        "Abstract": "To further understand Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis, the regulation of potential virulence genes needs to be investigated. The eis gene of M. tuberculosis H37Rv enhances the intracellular survival of Mycobacterium smegmatis, which does not contain eis, within macrophages (J. Wei, J. L. Dahl, J. W. Moulder, E. A. Roberts, P. O'Gaora, D. B. Young, and R. L. Friedman, J. Bacteriol. 182:377-384, 2000). Experiments were done to characterize the eis promoter in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis H37Ra. The putative -10 and -35 regions matched the Escherichia coli sigma(70) consensus 67 and 83%, respectively, making it a group A/SigA-like mycobacterial promoter. Expression of site-directed variants of the core promoter region, determined by flow cytometry using gfp as a reporter, showed that the putative -10 region is essential for eis expression. In addition, site-directed alteration of the eis promoter to the consensus E. coli sigma(70) promoter elements increased gfp transcription to levels similar to that driven by the heat shock promoter, phsp60, of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Upstream promoter deletion analysis showed that a 200- and 412-bp region of the promoter was necessary for maximum expression of gfp in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis H37Ra, respectively. Random mutagenesis of the 412-bp eis promoter, using a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase screen and activity assay, defined nucleotides upstream of the core promoter region that are essential to eis expression in both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis H37Ra, including a region homologous to a DinR cis element.",

        "Abstract": "The human serine protease inhibitor (serpin) gene cluster at 14q32.1 is a useful model system for studying the regulation of gene activity and chromatin structure. We demonstrated previously that the six known serpin genes in this region were organized into two subclusters of three genes each that occupied approximately 370 kb of DNA. To more fully understand the genomic organization of this region, we annotated a 1-Mb sequence contig from data from the Genoscope sequencing consortium (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/ ). We report that 11 different serpin genes reside within the 14q32.1 cluster, including two novel alpha1-antiproteinase-like gene sequences, a kallistatin-like sequence, and two recently identified serpins that had not been mapped previously to 14q32.1. The genomic regions proximal and distal to the serpin cluster contain a variety of unrelated gene sequences of diverse function. To gain insight into the chromatin organization of the region, sequences with putative nuclear matrix-binding potential were identified by using the MAR-Wiz algorithm, and these MAR-Wiz candidate sequences were tested for nuclear matrix-binding activity in vitro. Several differences between the MAR-Wiz predictions and the results of biochemical tests were observed. The genomic organization of the serpin gene cluster is discussed.",

They argue that the evidence that a husband had extramarital affairs, that he heavily insured his wife's life, or that he battered his wife is ordinarily of infinitesimal probative value. We disagree. To be sure, it would be foolish to predict solely on the basis of such evidence that a husband will murder his wife. However, when this kind of evidence is combined with other evidence in a realistic murder case, the evidence can be quite probative. We analyze cases in which it is virtually certain that the victim was murdered but unclear who murdered her, and in which it is uncertain whether the husband murdered the wife or she died by accident. We show that in each case motive evidence, such as a history of battering or of infidelity, can substantially increase the odds of the husband's guilt. We also consider the actual case on which Davis and Follette base their paper. We argue that testimony of Davis on the basis of the analysis presented in their paper was properly excluded, for it would have been misleading and unhelpful.",

Multiple controlled clinical trials and several meta-analyses of these data have examined various agents in different regimens. These data indicate that extended prophylaxis with a low-molecular-weight heparin after knee or hip arthroplasty significantly reduces the number of venous thromboembolic episodes with no increases in major bleeding. The data also show that > 98% of patients given long-term low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis remain free from symptomatic deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Therefore, to minimize patient risk safely and cost-effectively, extended prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin once-daily for 4 weeks after surgery should be considered for patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty.",
