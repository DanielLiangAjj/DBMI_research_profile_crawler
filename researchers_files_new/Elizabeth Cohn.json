        "Abstract": "Patients with heart failure (HF) often have multiple chronic conditions and are at increased risk for severe disease and mortality when infected by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Furthermore, disparities in outcomes with COVID-19 have been associated with both racial/ethnic identity but also social determinants of health. Among older, urban-dwelling, minority patients with HF, we sought to characterize medical and non-medical factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with HF living in Boston and New York City over 60 years of age participating in the Screening for Cardiac Amyloidosis with Nuclear Imaging (SCAN-MP) study between 12/1/2019 and 10/15/2021 (n = 180) were tested for nucleocapsid antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and queried for symptomatic infection with PCR verification. Baseline testing included the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), assessment of health literacy, biochemical, functional capacity, echocardiography, and a novel survey tool that determined living conditions, perceived risk of infection, and attitudes towards COVID-19 mitigation. The association of infection with prevalent socio-economic conditions was assessed by the area deprivation index (ADI). There were 50 overall cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (28%) including 40 demonstrating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (indicative of prior infection) and 10 positive PCR tests. There was no overlap between these groups. The first documented case from New York City indicated infection prior to January 17, 2020. Among active smokers, none tested positive for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (0 (0%) vs. 20 (15%), p = 0.004) vs. non-smokers. Cases were more likely to be taking ACE-inhibitors/ARBs compared to non-cases (78% vs 62%, p = 0.04). Over a mean follow-up of 9.6 months, there were 6 total deaths (3.3%) all unrelated to COVID-19. Death and hospitalizations (n = 84) were not associated with incident (PCR tested) or prior (antibody) SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no difference in age, co-morbidities, living conditions, attitudes toward mitigation, health literacy, or ADI between those with and without infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was common among older, minority patients with HF living in New York City and Boston, with evidence of infection documented in early January 2020. Health literacy and ADI were not associated with infection, and there was no increased mortality or hospitalizations among those infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

        "Abstract": "Community engagement (CE) is critical for advancing health equity and a key approach for promoting inclusive clinical and translational science. However, it requires a workforce trained to effectively design, implement, and evaluate health promotion and improvement strategies through meaningful collaboration with community members. This paper presents an approach for designing CE curricula for research, education, clinical care, and public health learners. A general pedagogical framework is presented to support curriculum development with the inclusion of community members as facilitators or faculty. The overall goal of the curriculum is envisioned as enabling learners to effectively demonstrate the principles of CE in working with community members on issues of concern to communities to promote health and well-being. We highlight transformations needed for the commonly used critical service-learning model and the importance of faculty well-versed in CE. Courses may include didactics and practicums with well-defined objectives and evaluation components. Because of the importance of building and maintaining relationships in CE, a preparatory phase is recommended prior to experiential learning, which should be guided and designed to include debriefing and reflective learning. Depending on the scope of the course, evaluation should include community perspectives on the experience.",

Genomic medicine is the study of genes and their interaction with health. Precision medicine is an approach to disease prevention and treatment that considers individual variability in genes, environment and lifestyle. Conclusions from studies lacking diversity may hinder generalizability as genomic variation occurs within and between populations. Historical factors, such as medical mistrust, ethical issues related to decision making, and data sharing pose complex challenges that may further widen inequities in genomic/precision medicine if not appropriately addressed. Although few biomedical studies integrate priorities of community partners into their conceptual framework, effective implementation of genomic/precision medicine research calls for the involvement of diverse stakeholders to expand traditional unidirectional models of engagement in clinical research towards authentic bidirectional collaboration.",

        "Abstract": "Dissemination and implementation (D&I) science is dedicated to studying how to effectively translate and apply research in real-world contexts. There has been increasing interest in health equity within the D&I field to ensure the equitable implementation of evidence-based programs/practices across a range of diverse populations and settings. At the same time, health equity researchers recognize the potential of D&I science to promote the more widespread dissemination, implementation, and sustainment of evidence-based interventions to address health inequities. The National Center for Accelerating Clinical and Translational Science Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program has been a champion for community engagement and translational scholarship in its mission to improve individual and population health. The overall CTSA infrastructure and resources within and among CTSA hubs are well-equipped to facilitate a health equity focus to D&I across the phases of translational research. This paper proposes a framework that demonstrates the interaction and opportunities between health equity and D&I science and highlights how CTSAs can support and facilitate wider efforts in translational research with a focus on equitable D&I.",

We conducted a concept analysis to define the concept of \"implementation of CPGs in health care settings.\" We utilized Walker and Avant's methodology to define the concept of \"implementation of CPGs in health care settings.\" This included a focused review of the literature, defining the relevant attributes, defining implementation, case examples, and antecedents and potential consequences from implementation of CPGs in health care settings. The concept \"implementation\" is complex, with numerous frameworks, facilitators, and barriers to implementation described in the literature. The existing literature supports our definition of implementation of CPGs in a health care setting as a process of changing practice in health care while utilizing the best level of evidence that is available in the published literature. These include 7 attributes necessary for effective implementation. Implementation of CPGs in health care settings requires an ongoing iterative process that considers these attributes and is inclusive to administrators, clinicians, and patients to ensure guidelines are understood, accepted, implemented, and evaluated for continued adoption of best practices. Ongoing efforts inclusive at all steps of implementation across multiple levels are needed to effectively change practice.",

Data came from the Texas Adolescent Tobacco and Marketing Surveillance system (TATAMS), a longitudinal cohort study of students who were in the 6th, 8th, and 10th grades (n = 3907) during the 2014-2015 academic year. Weighted generalized linear mixed models assessed multiple predictors' associated with the transition to susceptibility to e-cigarettes at 12 months. Among 6th graders, family influence, use of other substances, and positive affect were important. Adolescents transitioning from 8th grade to high school presented the greatest number of risk factors (e.g., social and normative influences). Only sensation seeking increased the risk of susceptibility to e-cigarettes among 10th graders. Overall, by grade level, incidence of susceptibility to e-cigarettes at 12 months did not vary, but risk factor profiles varied substantially.",

        "Abstract": "Historically, the tobacco industry has marketed directly to minority groups, which is associated with increased product use; the advent of e-cigarettes poses a new risk. The purpose of this study is to examine associations between exposure to tobacco marketing via traditional and digital marketing channels and ever use of e-cigarettes among Mexican-American young adults. Ninety-two Mexican-American young adults between 18 and 29 years of age (61% female) were recruited from the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort, a well-characterized population-based cohort on the U.S.- Mexico border. Participants reported their use of e-cigarettes and exposure to pro- and anti-media messages about these products in traditional and digital venues. Nearly one third reported ever using e-cigarettes and exposure to media overall was low. However, exposure to pro e-cigarette messages via digital sources was associated with increased odds of ever using e-cigarettes (OR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.11-7.38). Results suggest that regulations on e-cigarette digital media may help to reduce e-cigarette use.",

        "Abstract": "Precision medicine envisions a future of effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention grounded in precise understandings of the genetic and environmental determinants of disease. Given that the original genome-wide association studies represented a predominately European White population, and that diversity in genomic studies must account for genetic variation both within and across racial categories, new research studies are at a heightened risk for inadequate representation. Currently biological samples are being made available for sequencing in biobanks across the USA, but the diversity of those samples is unknown. The aims of this study were to describe the types of recruitment and enrollment materials used by US biobanks and the diversity of the samples contained within their collection. Biobank websites and brochures were evaluated for reading level, health literacy, and factors known to encourage the recruitment of minorities, such as showing pictures of diverse populations. Biobank managers were surveyed by mail on the methods and materials used for enrollment, recruitment, consent, and the self-reported race/ethnicity of biobank participants. From 51 US biobanks (68% response rate), recruitment and enrollment materials were in English only, and most of the websites and brochures exceeded a fifth-grade reading level. When compared to the 2015 US Census, self-reported race/ethnicity of participants was not significantly different for Whites (61%) and blacks (13%). The percentages were significantly lower for Hispanics and Latinos (18 vs. 7%, p = 0.00) and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (0.2 vs. 0.01%; p = 0.01) and higher for Asians (13 vs. 5%, p = 0.01). Materials for recruitment predominantly in English may limit participation by underrepresented populations.",

Although racial and ethnic minorities represent 37% of Americans, they comprise only 16% of the nursing workforce. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of state legislation on minority recruitment to nursing. Using data from the National Conference of State Legislatures, American Association of Colleges of Nursing, and U.S. census, we compared minority enrollment in baccalaureate nursing programs of states (Texas, Virginia, Michigan, California, Florida, Connecticut, and Arkansas) before and 3 years after enacting legislation with geographically adjacent states without legislation. Data were analyzed using descriptive and chi-square statistics. Following legislation, Arkansas (13.8%-24.5%), California (3.3%-5.4%), and Michigan (8.0%-10.0%) significantly increased enrollment of Blacks, and Florida (11.8%-15.4%) and Texas (11.2%-13.9%) significantly increased enrollment of Hispanic baccalaureate nursing students. States that tied legislation to funding, encouragement, and reimbursement had larger enrollment gains and greater minority representation.",

        "Abstract": "Introducing whole genome sequencing (WGS) into pediatric cancer research at diagnosis poses unique challenges related to informed consent. WGS requires tissue obtained prior to initiating treatment, when families may be overwhelmed with uncertainty and fear. Motivation to participate may be high without fully understanding the range of possible results, including secondary findings. Little is known about parental knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about this type of research.",

        "Abstract": "Achieving equitable minority representation in genomic biobanking is one of the most difficult challenges faced by researchers today. Capacity building--a framework for research that includes collaborations and on-going engagement--can be used to help researchers, clinicians and communities better understand the process, utility, and clinical application of genomic science. The purpose of this exploratory descriptive study was to examine factors that influence the decision to participate in genomic research, and identify essential components of capacity building with a community at risk of being under-represented in biobanks. Results of focus groups conducted in Central Harlem with 46 participants were analyzed by a collaborative team of community and academic investigators using content analysis and AtlisTi. Key themes identified were: (1) the potential contribution of biobanking to individual and community health, for example the effect of the environment on health, (2) the societal context of the science, such as DNA criminal databases and paternity testing, that may affect the decision to participate, and (3) the researchers' commitment to community health as an outcome of capacity building. These key factors can contribute to achieving equity in biobank participation, and guide genetic specialists in biobank planning and implementation.",

We identified 418 studies; 14 met inclusion criteria. Studies consistently reported decreases in ASD diagnosis (range 7.3-68.4%) using DSM-5 criteria. There were statistically significant pooled decreases in ASD [31% (20-44), p = 0.006] and DSM-IV-TR subgroups of Autistic disorder [22% (16-29), p < 0.001] and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) [70% (55-82), p = 0.01]; however, Asperger's disorder pooled decrease was not significant [70% (26-94), p = 0.38]. DSM-5 will likely decrease the number of individuals diagnosed with ASD, particularly the PDD-NOS subgroup. Research is needed on policies regarding services for individuals lacking diagnosis but requiring assistance.",

This study describes the current practice of menu board calorie postings in a low-income urban neighborhood, identifies the extent to which current practice complies with existing policy, and evaluates the practical utility of menu boards to consumers. We conclude that although most postings were legally compliant, they did not demonstrate utility. Menu postings for individual servings are easily understood, but complex math skills are needed to interpret meals designed to serve more than one person. In some items, calories doubled depending on flavor and the calorie posting did not give enough information to make healthier selections. We identified specific strategies to improve practical utility and provide recommendations for policy implementation.",

        "Abstract": "Although collaborative research across sites is essential to increase the statistical power and generalizability of research findings, the need to undergo multiple institutional review board (IRB) reviews is a challenge. The purposes of this paper are to describe changes in the IRB submission process in 2 national multisite studies before and after the implementation of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy rule (2002 and 2008) and to discuss implications for policy and practice related to human subjects research. In the second study, there was a shorter mean approval time and reduced variability in the decision about the level of review, the mean number of pages per application doubled, and an increased proportion of IRBs required conflict of interest and data use agreements. Possible approaches to further enhance the efficiency and streamlining of the research review process are suggested.",

The author reviews the current state of HIV vaccine development in response to the human and fiscal cost of the HIV epidemic, both in the United States and globally. A translational model is proposed for restructuring the process by which participants in HIV trials are recruited and the results disseminated. Finally, it is proposed that nurses should play a unique and essential role in implementing this new model, advocating for individuals, strengthening societal trust, and fostering equity.",

The sample for this study consisted of second-year baccalaureate nursing students in a required clinical skills course. Students in the control group were taught medication calculations using the traditional math method during one semester, whereas students in the experimental group were taught the same material using dimensional analysis during the next semester. Analysis of the collected data from a medication dosage calculation examination revealed the dimensional analysis group scored with greater accuracy than the traditional math group.",
