        "Abstract": "Targeted recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases to degrade traditionally undruggable proteins is a disruptive paradigm for developing new therapeutics. Two salient limitations are that <2% of the ~600 E3 ligases in the human genome have been exploited to produce proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and the efficacy of the approach has not been demonstrated for a vital class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins- ion channels. NEDD4-1 and NEDD4-2 are physiological regulators of myriad ion channels, and belong to the 28-member HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus) family of E3 ligases with widespread roles in cell/developmental biology and diverse diseases including various cancers, immunological and neurological disorders, and chronic pain. The potential efficacy of HECT E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation is unexplored, constrained by a lack of appropriate binders, and uncertain due to their complex regulation by layered intra-molecular and posttranslational mechanisms. Here, we identified a nanobody that binds with high affinity and specificity to a unique site on the N-lobe of the NEDD4-2 HECT domain at a location physically separate from sites critical for catalysis- the E2 binding site, the catalytic cysteine, and the ubiquitin exosite- as revealed by a 3.1 Å cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction.

        "Abstract": "Neuropathic pain caused by lesions to somatosensory neurons due to injury or disease is a widespread public health problem that is inadequately managed by small-molecule therapeutics due to incomplete pain relief and devastating side effects. Genetically encoded molecules capable of interrupting nociception have the potential to confer long-lasting analgesia with minimal off-target effects. Here, we utilize a targeted ubiquitination approach to achieve a unique posttranslational functional knockdown of high-voltage-activated calcium channels (HVACCs) that are obligatory for neurotransmission in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. CaV-aβlator comprises a nanobody targeted to CaV channel cytosolic auxiliary β subunits fused to the catalytic HECT domain of the Nedd4-2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Subcutaneous injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 encoding CaV-aβlator in the hind paw of mice resulted in the expression of the protein in a subset of DRG neurons that displayed a concomitant ablation of CaV currents and also led to an increase in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Mice subjected to spare nerve injury displayed a characteristic long-lasting mechanical, thermal, and cold hyperalgesia underlain by a dramatic increase in coordinated phasic firing of DRG neurons as reported by in vivo Ca2+ spike recordings. CaV-aβlator significantly dampened the integrated Ca2+ spike activity and the hyperalgesia in response to nerve injury. The results advance the principle of targeting HVACCs as a gene therapy for neuropathic pain and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of posttranslational functional knockdown of ion channels achieved by exploiting the ubiquitin-proteasome system.",

        "Abstract": "Selective ion channel modulators play a critical role in physiology in defining the contribution of specific ion channels to physiological function and as proof of concept for novel therapeutic strategies. Antibodies are valuable research tools that have broad uses including defining the expression and localization of ion channels in native tissue, and capturing ion channel proteins for subsequent analyses. In this review, we detail how renewable and recombinant antibodies can be used to control ion channel function. We describe the different forms of renewable and recombinant antibodies that have been used and the mechanisms by which they modulate ion channel function. We highlight the use of recombinant antibodies that are expressed intracellularly (intrabodies) as genetically encoded tools to control ion channel function. We also offer perspectives of avenues of future research that may be opened by the application of emerging technologies for engineering recombinant antibodies for enhanced utility in ion channel research. Overall, this review provides insights that may help stimulate and guide interested researchers to develop and incorporate renewable and recombinant antibodies as valuable tools to control ion channel function.",

        "Abstract": "Plasma membrane-localized ion channels are essential for diverse physiological processes such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and osmotic homeostasis. The surface density of such ion channels is a major determinant of their function, and tuning this variable is a powerful way to regulate physiology. Dysregulation of ion channel surface density due to inherited or de novo mutations underlies many serious diseases, and molecules that can correct trafficking deficits are potential therapeutics and useful research tools. We have developed targeted ubiquitination and deubiquitination approaches that enable selective posttranslational down- or up-regulation, respectively, of desired ion channels. The method employs bivalent molecules comprised of an ion-channel-targeted nanobody fused to catalytic domains of either an E3 ubiquitin ligase or a deubiquitinase. Here, we use two examples to provide detailed protocols that illustrate the utility of the approach-rescued surface expression of a trafficking-deficient mutant K",

        "Title": "Targeted deubiquitination rescues distinct trafficking-deficient ion channelopathies.",
        "Abstract": "Impaired protein stability or trafficking underlies diverse ion channelopathies and represents an unexploited unifying principle for developing common treatments for otherwise dissimilar diseases. Ubiquitination limits ion channel surface density, but targeting this pathway for the purposes of basic study or therapy is challenging because of its prevalent role in proteostasis. We developed engineered deubiquitinases (enDUBs) that enable selective ubiquitin chain removal from target proteins to rescue the functional expression of disparate mutant ion channels that underlie long QT syndrome (LQT) and cystic fibrosis (CF). In an LQT type 1 (LQT1) cardiomyocyte model, enDUB treatment restored delayed rectifier potassium currents and normalized action potential duration. CF-targeted enDUBs synergistically rescued common (ΔF508) and pharmacotherapy-resistant (N1303K) CF mutations when combined with the US Food and Drug Administation (FDA)-approved drugs Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and Trikafta (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor). Altogether, targeted deubiquitination via enDUBs provides a powerful protein stabilization method that not only corrects diverse diseases caused by impaired ion channel trafficking, but also introduces a new tool for deconstructing the ubiquitin code in situ.",

        "Title": "High-fat diet-dependent modulation of the delayed rectifier K(+) current in adult guinea pig atrial myocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Obesity is associated with hyperlipidemia, electrical remodeling of the heart, and increased risk of supraventricular arrhythmias in both male and female patients. The delayed rectifier K(+) current (IK), is an important regulator of atrial repolarization. There is a paucity of studies on the functional role of IK in response to obesity. Here, we assessed the obesity-mediated functional modulation of IK in low-fat diet (LFD), and high-fat diet (HFD) fed adult guinea pigs. Guinea pigs were randomly divided into control and obese groups fed, ad libitum, with a LFD (10 kcal% fat) or a HFD (45 kcal% fat) respectively. Action potential duration (APD), and IK were studied in atrial myocytes and IKr and IKs in HEK293 cells using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. HFD guinea pigs displayed a significant increase in body weight, total cholesterol and total triglycerides within 50 days. Atrial APD at 30% (APD30) and 90% (APD90) repolarization were shorter, while atrial IK density was significantly increased in HFD guinea pigs. Exposure to palmitic acid (PA) increased heterologously expressed IKr and IKs densities, while oleic acid (OA), severely reduced IKr and had no effect on IKs. The data are first to show that in obese guinea pigs abbreviated APD is due to increased IK density likely through elevations of PA. Our findings may have crucial implications for targeted treatment options for obesity-related arrhythmias.",

        "Abstract": "Rad and Rem are Ras-like G-proteins linked to diverse cardiovascular functions and pathophysiology. Understanding how Rad and Rem are regulated is important for deepened insights into their pathophysiological roles. As in other Ras-like G-proteins, Rad and Rem contain a conserved guanine-nucleotide binding domain (G-domain). Canonically, G-domains are key control modules, functioning as nucleotide-regulated switches of G-protein activity. Whether Rad and Rem G-domains conform to this canonical paradigm is ambiguous. Here, we used multiple functional measurements in HEK293 cells and cardiomyocytes (Ca(V)1.2 currents, Ca(2+) transients, Ca(V)β binding) as biosensors to probe the role of the G-domain in regulation of Rad and Rem function. We utilized Rad(S105N) and Rem(T94N), which are the cognate mutants to Ras(S17N), a dominant-negative variant of Ras that displays decreased nucleotide binding affinity. In HEK293 cells, over-expression of either Rad(S105N) or Rem(T94N) strongly inhibited reconstituted Ca(V)1.2 currents to the same extent as their wild-type (wt) counterparts, contrasting with reports that Rad(S105N) is functionally inert in HEK293 cells. Adenovirus-mediated expression of either wt Rad or Rad(S105N) in cardiomyocytes dramatically blocked L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and inhibited Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release, contradicting reports that Rad(S105N) acts as a dominant negative in heart. By contrast, Rem(T94N) was significantly less effective than wt Rem at inhibiting I(Ca,L) and Ca(2+) transients in cardiomyocytes. FRET analyses in cardiomyocytes revealed that both Rad(S105N) and Rem(T94N) had moderately reduced binding affinity for Ca(V)βs relative to their wt counterparts. The results indicate Rad and Rem are non-canonical G-proteins with respect to the regulatory role of their G-domain in Ca(V)1.2 regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Ca(2+)-activated chloride channels encoded by TMEM16A and 16B are important for regulating epithelial mucus secretion, cardiac and neuronal excitability, smooth muscle contraction, olfactory transduction, and cell proliferation. Whether and how the ubiquitous Ca(2+) sensor calmodulin (CaM) regulates the activity of TMEM16A and 16B channels has been controversial and the subject of an ongoing debate. Recently, using a bioengineering approach termed ChIMP (Channel Inactivation induced by Membrane-tethering of an associated Protein) we argued that Ca(2+)-free CaM (apoCaM) is pre-associated with functioning TMEM16A and 16B channel complexes in live cells. Further, the pre-associated apoCaM mediates Ca(2+)-dependent sensitization of activation (CDSA) and Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI) of some TMEM16A splice variants. In this review, we discuss these findings in the context of previous and recent results relating to Ca(2+)-dependent regulation of TMEM16A/16B channels and the putative role of CaM. We further discuss potential future directions for these nascent ideas on apoCaM regulation of TMEM16A/16B channels, noting that such future efforts will benefit greatly from the pioneering work of Dr. David T. Yue and colleagues on CaM regulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels.",

        "Abstract": "Ca(2+)-activated chloride currents carried via transmembrane proteins TMEM16A and TMEM16B regulate diverse processes including mucus secretion, neuronal excitability, smooth muscle contraction, olfactory signal transduction, and cell proliferation. Understanding how TMEM16A/16B are regulated by Ca(2+) is critical for defining their (patho)/physiological roles and for rationally targeting them therapeutically. Here, using a bioengineering approach--channel inactivation induced by membrane-tethering of an associated protein (ChIMP)--we discovered that Ca(2+)-free calmodulin (apoCaM) is preassociated with TMEM16A/16B channel complexes. The resident apoCaM mediates two distinct Ca(2+)-dependent effects on TMEM16A, as revealed by expression of dominant-negative CaM1234. These effects are Ca(2+)-dependent sensitization of activation (CDSA) and Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI). CDI and CDSA are independently mediated by the N and C lobes of CaM, respectively. TMEM16A alternative splicing provides a mechanism for tuning apoCaM effects. Channels lacking splice segment b selectively lost CDI, and segment a is necessary for apoCaM preassociation with TMEM16A. The results reveal multidimensional regulation of TMEM16A/16B by preassociated apoCaM and introduce ChIMP as a versatile tool to probe the macromolecular complex and function of Ca(2+)-activated chloride channels.",

Fundamental understanding of ion channel structure-function mechanisms, their physiological roles, how their dysfunction leads to disease, their utility as biosensors, and development of novel molecules to modulate their activity are important and active research frontiers. In this review, we focus on ion channel engineering approaches that have been applied to investigate these aspects of ion channel function, with a major emphasis on voltage-gated ion channels.",

CaV1/CaV2 channel blockers have broad biotechnological and therapeutic applications. Here we report a general method for developing novel genetically encoded calcium channel blockers inspired by Rem, a small G-protein that constitutively inhibits CaV1/CaV2 channels. We show that diverse cytosolic proteins (CaVβ, 14-3-3, calmodulin and CaMKII) that bind pore-forming α1-subunits can be converted into calcium channel blockers with tunable selectivity, kinetics and potency, simply by anchoring them to the plasma membrane. We term this method 'channel inactivation induced by membrane-tethering of an associated protein' (ChIMP). ChIMP is potentially extendable to small-molecule drug discovery, as engineering FK506-binding protein into intracellular sites within CaV1.2-α1C permits heterodimerization-initiated channel inhibition with rapamycin. The results reveal a universal method for developing novel calcium channel blockers that may be extended to develop probes for a broad cohort of unrelated ion channels.",

        "Abstract": "Manipulating expression of large genes (>6 kb) in adult cardiomyocytes is challenging because these cells are only efficiently transduced by viral vectors with a 4-7 kb packaging capacity. This limitation impedes understanding structure-function mechanisms of important proteins in heart. L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) regulate diverse facets of cardiac physiology including excitation-contraction coupling, excitability, and gene expression. Many important questions about how LTCCs mediate such multidimensional signaling are best resolved by manipulating expression of the 6.6 kb pore-forming α1C-subunit in adult cardiomyocytes. Here, we use split-intein-mediated protein transsplicing to reconstitute LTCC α1C-subunit from two distinct halves, overcoming the difficulty of expressing full-length α1C in cardiomyocytes. Split-intein-tagged α1C fragments encoding dihydropyridine-resistant channels were incorporated into adenovirus and reconstituted in cardiomyocytes. Similar to endogenous LTCCs, recombinant channels targeted to dyads, triggered Ca(2+) transients, associated with caveolin-3, and supported β-adrenergic regulation of excitation-contraction coupling. This approach lowers a longstanding technical hurdle to manipulating large proteins in cardiomyocytes.",

        "Abstract": "In the heart, Ca(2+) influx via Ca(V)1.2 L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) is a multi-functional signal that triggers muscle contraction, controls action potential duration, and regulates gene expression. The use of LTCC Ca(2+) as a multi-dimensional signalling molecule in the heart is complicated by several aspects of cardiac physiology. Cytosolic Ca(2+) continuously cycles between ~100 nM and ~1 μM with each heartbeat due to Ca(2+) linked signalling from LTCCs to ryanodine receptors. This rapid cycling raises the question as to how cardiac myocytes distinguish the Ca(2+) fluxes originating through L-type channels that are dedicated to contraction from Ca(2+) fluxes originating from other L-type channels that are used for non-contraction-related signalling. In general, disparate Ca(2+) sources in cardiac myocytes such as current through differently localized LTCCs as well as from IP3 receptors can signal selectively to Ca(2+)-dependent effectors in local microdomains that can be impervious to the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) transients that drive contraction. A particular challenge for diversified signalling via cardiac LTCCs is that they are voltage-gated and, therefore, open and presumably flood their microdomains with Ca(2+) with each action potential. Thus spatial localization of Cav1.2 channels to different types of microdomains of the ventricular cardiomyocyte membrane as well as the existence of particular macromolecular complexes in each Cav1.2 microdomain are important to effect different types of Cav1.2 signalling. In this review we examine aspects of Cav1.2 structure, targeting and signalling in two specialized membrane microdomains--transverse tubules and caveolae.",

        "Abstract": "Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channels, comprised of pore-forming α(1) and auxiliary (β,α(2)δ) subunits, control diverse biological responses in excitable cells. Molecules blocking Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channel currents (I(Ca)) profoundly regulate physiology and have many therapeutic applications. Rad/Rem/Rem2/Gem GTPases (RGKs) strongly inhibit Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channels. Understanding how RGKs block I(Ca) is critical for insights into their physiological function, and may provide design principles for developing novel Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channel inhibitors. The RGK binding sites within Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channel complexes responsible for I(Ca) inhibition are ambiguous, and it is unclear whether there are mechanistic differences among distinct RGKs. All RGKs bind β subunits, but it is unknown if and how this interaction contributes to I(Ca) inhibition. We investigated the role of RGK/β interaction in Rem inhibition of recombinant Ca(V)1.2 channels, using a mutated β (β(2aTM)) selectively lacking RGK binding. Rem blocked β(2aTM)-reconstituted channels (74% inhibition) less potently than channels containing wild-type β(2a) (96% inhibition), suggesting the prevalence of both β-binding-dependent and independent modes of inhibition. Two mechanistic signatures of Rem inhibition of Ca(V)1.2 channels (decreased channel surface density and open probability), but not a third (reduced maximal gating charge), depended on Rem binding to β. We identified a novel Rem binding site in Ca(V)1.2 α(1C) N-terminus that mediated β-binding-independent inhibition. The Ca(V)2.2 α(1B) subunit lacks the Rem binding site in the N-terminus and displays a solely β-binding-dependent form of channel inhibition. Finally, we discovered an unexpected functional dichotomy amongst distinct RGKs- while Rem and Rad use both β-binding-dependent and independent mechanisms, Gem and Rem2 use only a β-binding-dependent method to inhibit Ca(V)1.2 channels. The results provide new mechanistic perspectives, and reveal unexpected variations in determinants, underlying inhibition of Ca(V)1.2/Ca(V)2.2 channels by distinct RGK GTPases.",

        "Abstract": "Ca(2+) influx via Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channels drives processes ranging from neurotransmission to muscle contraction. Association of a pore-forming α(1) and cytosolic β is necessary for trafficking Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channels to the cell surface through poorly understood mechanisms. A prevalent idea suggests β binds the α(1) intracellular I-II loop, masking an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal as the dominant mechanism for Ca(V)1/Ca(V)2 channel membrane trafficking. There are hints that other α(1) subunit cytoplasmic domains may play a significant role, but the nature of their potential contribution is unclear. We assessed the roles of all intracellular domains of Ca(V)1.2-α(1C) by generating chimeras featuring substitutions of all possible permutations of intracellular loops/termini of α(1C) into the β-independent Ca(V)3.1-α(1G) channel. Surprisingly, functional analyses demonstrated α(1C) I-II loop strongly increases channel surface density while other cytoplasmic domains had a competing opposing effect. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified an acidic-residue putative ER export motif responsible for the I-II loop-mediated increase in channel surface density. β-dependent increase in current arose as an emergent property requiring four α(1C) intracellular domains, with the I-II loop and C-terminus being essential. The results suggest β binding to the α(1C) I-II loop causes a C-terminus-dependent rearrangement of intracellular domains, shifting a balance of power between export signals on the I-II loop and retention signals elsewhere.",

        "Abstract": "Rad/Rem/Gem/Kir (RGK) GTPases potently inhibit Ca(V)1 and Ca(V)2 (Ca(V)1-2) channels, a paradigm of ion channel regulation by monomeric G-proteins with significant physiological ramifications and potential biotechnology applications. The mechanism(s) underlying how RGK proteins inhibit I(Ca) is unknown, and it is unclear how key structural and regulatory properties of these GTPases (such as the role of GTP binding to the nucleotide binding domain (NBD), and the C-terminus which contains a membrane-targeting motif) feature in this effect. Here, we show that Rem inhibits Ca(V)1.2 channels by three independent mechanisms that rely on distinct configurations of the GTPase: (1) a reduction in surface density of channels is accomplished by enhancing dynamin-dependent endocytosis, (2) a diminution of channel open probability (P(o)) that occurs without impacting on voltage sensor movement, and (3) an immobilization of Ca(V) channel voltage sensors. The presence of both the Rem NBD and C-terminus (whether membrane-targeted or not) in one molecule is sufficient to reconstitute all three mechanisms. However, membrane localization of the NBD by a generic membrane-targeting module reconstitutes only the decreased P(o) function (mechanism 2). A point mutation that prevents GTP binding to the NBD selectively eliminates the capacity to immobilize voltage sensors (mechanism 3). The results reveal an uncommon multiplicity in the mechanisms Rem uses to inhibit I(Ca), predict new physiological dimensions of the RGK GTPase-Ca(V) channel crosstalk, and suggest original approaches for developing novel Ca(V) channel blockers.",

Not surprisingly, blocking Ca(V) channel activity is a powerful method to regulate the function of excitable cells, and this is exploited for both physiological and therapeutic benefit. Nevertheless, the full potential for Ca(V) channel inhibition is not being realized by currently available small-molecule blockers or second-messenger modulators due to limitations in targeting them either to defined groups of cells in an organism or to distinct subcellular regions within a single cell.

The heart is isolated and perfused with collagenase and protease under low Ca2+ conditions to recover single myocytes. Ca2+-tolerant cells are obtained by stepwise increases in extracellular Ca2+ concentration in three subsequent wash steps. Cells are filtered, resuspended in culture medium, and plated on laminin coated slips. Cultured myocytes obtained using this protocol are viable for up to four days and are suitable for most experiments including electrophysiology, biochemistry, imaging and molecular biology.",

        "Abstract": "Protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated enhancement of L-type calcium currents (I(Ca,L)) is essential for sympathetic regulation of the heartbeat and is the classic example of channel regulation by phosphorylation, and its loss is a common hallmark of heart failure. Mechanistic understanding of how distinct Ca(V) channel subunits contribute to PKA modulation of I(Ca,L) has been intensely pursued yet remains elusive. Moreover, critical features of this regulation such as its functional reserve (the surplus capacity available for modulation) in the heart are unknown. Here, we use an overexpression paradigm in heart cells to simultaneously identify the impact of auxiliary Ca(V)betas on PKA modulation of I(Ca,L) and to gauge the functional reserve of this regulation in the heart. Ca(V)1.2 channels containing wild-type beta(2a) or a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (beta(2a,AAA)) were equally upregulated by PKA, discounting a necessary role for beta phosphorylation. Nevertheless, channels reconstituted with beta(2a) displayed a significantly diminished PKA response compared with other beta isoforms, an effect explainable by a uniquely higher basal P(o) of beta(2a) channels. Overexpression of all betas increased basal current density, accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the magnitude of PKA regulation. Scatter plots of fold increase in current against basal current density revealed an inverse relationship that was conserved across species and conformed to a model in which a large fraction of channels remained unmodified after PKA activation. These results redefine the role of beta subunits in PKA modulation of Ca(V)1.2 channels and uncover a new design principle of this phenomenon in the heart, vis à vis a limited functional reserve.",

        "Abstract": "Voltage-gated Ca2+ (Ca(V)) channels are central to the biology of excitable cells, and therefore regulating their activity has widespread applications. We describe genetically encoded molecules for inducibly inhibiting Ca(V) channels (GEMIICCs). GEMIICCs are derivatives of Rem, a Ras-like GTPase that constitutively inhibits Ca2+ currents (I(Ca)). C terminus-truncated Rem(1-265) lost the ability to inhibit I(Ca) owing to loss of membrane targeting. Fusing the C1 domain of protein kinase Cgamma to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-Rem(1-265) generated a molecule that rapidly translocated from cytosol to plasma membrane with phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate in human embryonic kidney cells. Recombinant Ca(V)2.2 and Ca(V)1.2 channels were inhibited concomitantly with C1(PKCgamma)-YFP-Rem(1-265) membrane translocation. The generality of the approach was confirmed by creating a GEMIICC using rapamycin-dependent heterodimerization of YFP-FKBP-Rem(1-265) and a constitutively membrane-targeted rapamycin-binding domain. GEMIICCs reduced I(Ca) without diminishing gating charge, thereby ruling out decreased number of surface channels and voltage-sensor immobilization as mechanisms for inhibition. We introduce small-molecule-regulated GEMIICCs as potent tools for rapidly manipulating Ca2+ signals in excitable cells.",

        "Abstract": "Auxiliary Ca(2+) channel beta subunits (Ca(V)beta) regulate cellular Ca(2+) signaling by trafficking pore-forming alpha(1) subunits to the membrane and normalizing channel gating. These effects are mediated through a characteristic src homology 3/guanylate kinase (SH3-GK) structural module, a design feature shared in common with the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family of scaffold proteins. However, the mechanisms by which the Ca(V)beta SH3-GK module regulates multiple Ca(2+) channel functions are not well understood. Here, using a split-domain approach, we investigated the role of the interrelationship between Ca(V)beta SH3 and GK domains in defining channel properties. The studies build upon a previously identified split-domain pair that displays a trans SH3-GK interaction, and fully reconstitutes Ca(V)beta effects on channel trafficking, activation gating, and increased open probability (P(o)). Here, by varying the precise locations used to separate SH3 and GK domains and monitoring subsequent SH3-GK interactions by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we identified a particular split-domain pair that displayed a subtly altered configuration of the trans SH3-GK interaction. Remarkably, this pair discriminated between Ca(V)beta trafficking and gating properties: alpha(1C) targeting to the membrane was fully reconstituted, whereas shifts in activation gating and increased P(o) functions were selectively lost. A more extreme case, in which the trans SH3-GK interaction was selectively ablated, yielded a split-domain pair that could reconstitute neither the trafficking nor gating-modulation functions, even though both moieties could independently engage their respective binding sites on the alpha(1C) (Ca(V)1.2) subunit. The results reveal that Ca(V)beta SH3 and GK domains function codependently to tune Ca(2+) channel trafficking and gating properties, and suggest new paradigms for physiological and therapeutic regulation of Ca(2+) channel activity.",

Despite their central role, it is unclear whether binding of a single Ca(V)beta, or multiple Ca(V)betas, to an alpha(1) subunit governs the two distinct functions. Conventional experiments utilizing coexpression of alpha(1) and Ca(V)beta subunits have been unable to resolve the ambiguity due to difficulties in establishing their stoichiometry in functional channels. Here, we unambiguously establish a 1: 1 stoichiometry by covalently linking Ca(V)beta(2b) to the carboxyl terminus of alpha(1C) (Ca(V)1.2), creating alpha(1C).beta(2b). Recombinant L-type channels reconstituted in HEK 293 cells with alpha(1C).beta(2b) supported whole-cell currents to the same extent as channels reconstituted via coexpression of the individual subunits. Analysis of gating charge showed alpha(1C).beta(2b) fully restored channel trafficking to the plasma membrane. Co-transfecting Ca(V)beta(2a) with alpha(1C).beta(2b) had little further impact on function. To rule out the possibility that fused Ca(V)beta(2b) was interacting in trans with neighbouring alpha(1) molecules, alpha(1C).beta(2b) was cotransfected with alpha(1B) (Ca(V)2.2), and pharmacological block with nimodipine showed an absence of alpha(1B) trafficking. These results establish that association of a single Ca(V)beta with a pore-forming alpha(1) subunit captures the functional essence of HVA calcium channels, and introduce alpha(1)-Ca(V)beta fusion proteins as a powerful new tool to probe structure-function mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "High-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels regulate diverse functions ranging from muscle contraction to synaptic transmission. Association between auxiliary beta- and distinct pore-forming alpha1-subunits is obligatory for forming functional high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, yet the structural determinants underlying this interaction remain poorly understood. Recently, homology modeling of Ca(2+)-channel beta1b-subunit identified src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase (GK) motifs in a tandem arrangement reminiscent of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) class of scaffolding proteins. However, direct evidence for MAGUK-like properties and their functional implications in beta-subunits is lacking. Here, we show a functional requirement for both SH3 and GK domains in beta2a. Point mutations in either the putative beta2a SH3 or GK domains severely blunted modulation of recombinant L-type channels, showing the importance of both motifs for a functional alpha1-beta interaction. Coexpression of these functionally deficient beta2a-SH3 and GK mutants rescued WT currents, demonstrating trans complementation similar to that observed in MAGUKs. Truncated \"hemi-beta2a\" subunits, containing either the SH3 or GK domain, were ineffective on their own, but reconstituted WT currents when coexpressed. Moreover, the SH3 and GK domains were found to interact in vitro. These findings reveal MAGUK-like properties in beta-subunits that are critical for alpha1-subunit modulation, revise current models of alpha1-beta association, and predict new physiological dimensions of beta-subunit function.",

        "Title": "Custom distinctions in the interaction of G-protein beta subunits with N-type (CaV2.2) versus P/Q-type (CaV2.1) calcium channels.",
        "Abstract": "Inhibition of N- (Cav2.2) and P/Q-type (Cav2.1) calcium channels by G-proteins contribute importantly to presynaptic inhibition as well as to the effects of opiates and cannabinoids. Accordingly, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying G-protein inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels has been a major research focus. So far, inhibition is thought to result from the interaction of multiple proposed sites with the Gbetagamma complex (Gbetagamma). Far less is known about the important interaction sites on Gbetagamma itself. Here, we developed a novel electrophysiological paradigm, \"compound-state willing-reluctant analysis,\" to describe Gbetagamma interaction with N- and P/Q-type channels, and to provide a sensitive and efficient screen for changes in modulatory behavior over a broad range of potentials. The analysis confirmed that the apparent (un)binding kinetics of Gbetagamma with N-type are twofold slower than with P/Q-type at the voltage extremes, and emphasized that the kinetic discrepancy increases up to ten-fold in the mid-voltage range. To further investigate apparent differences in modulatory behavior, we screened both channels for the effects of single point alanine mutations within four regions of Gbeta1, at residues known to interact with Galpha. These residues might thereby be expected to interact with channel effectors. Of eight mutations studied, six affected G-protein modulation of both N- and P/Q-type channels to varying degrees, and one had no appreciable effect on either channel. The remaining mutation was remarkable for selective attenuation of effects on P/Q-, but not N-type channels. Surprisingly, this mutation decreased the (un)binding rates without affecting its overall affinity. The latter mutation suggests that the binding surface on Gbetagamma for N- and P/Q-type channels are different. Also, the manner in which this last mutation affected P/Q-type channels suggests that some residues may be important for \"steering\" or guiding the protein into the binding pocket, whereas others are important for simply binding to the channel.",

        "Title": "Distinctive modulatory effects of five human auxiliary beta2 subunit splice variants on L-type calcium channel gating.",
        "Abstract": "Sequence analysis of the human genome permitted cloning of five Ca(2+)-channel beta(2) splice variants (beta(2a)-beta(2e)) that differed only in their proximal amino-termini. The functional consequences of such beta(2)-subunit diversity were explored in recombinant L-type channels reconstituted in HEK 293 cells. Beta(2a) and beta(2e) targeted autonomously to the plasma membrane, whereas beta(2b)-beta(2d) localized to the cytosol when expressed in HEK 293 cells. The pattern of modulation of L-type channel voltage-dependent inactivation gating correlated with the subcellular localization of the component beta(2) variant-membrane-bound beta(2a) and beta(2e) subunits conferred slow(er) channel inactivation kinetics and displayed a smaller fraction of channels recovering from inactivation with fast kinetics, compared to beta(2b)-beta(2d) channels. The varying effects of beta(2) subunits on inactivation gating were accounted for by a quantitative model in which L-type channels reversibly distributed between fast and slow forms of voltage-dependent inactivation-membrane-bound beta(2) subunits substantially decreased the steady-state fraction of fast inactivating channels. Finally, the beta(2) variants also had distinctive effects on L-type channel steady-state activation gating, as revealed by differences in the waveforms of tail-activation (G-V) curves, and conferred differing degrees of prepulse facilitation to the channel. Our results predict important physiological consequences arising from subtle changes in Ca(2+)-channel beta(2)-subunit structure due to alternative splicing and emphasize the utility of splice variants in probing structure-function mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Engineered calmodulins (CaMs), rendered Ca2+-insensitive by mutations, function as dominant negatives in heterologous systems, and have revealed mechanisms of ion channel modulation by Ca2+/CaM. The use of these CaMs in native mammalian cells now emerges as a strategy to unmask the biology of such Ca2+ feedback. Here, we developed recombinant adenoviruses bearing engineered CaMs to facilitate their expression in adult heart cells, where Ca2+ regulation may be essential for moment-to-moment control of the heartbeat. Engineered CaMs not only eliminated the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of native calcium channels, but exposed an unexpectedly large impact of removing such feedback: the unprecedented (4- to 5-fold) prolongation of action potentials. This striking result recasts the basic paradigm for action-potential control and illustrates the promise of virally delivered engineered CaM to investigate the biology of numerous other CaM-signaling pathways.",

        "Title": "Novel functional properties of Ca(2+) channel beta subunits revealed by their expression in adult rat heart cells.",
        "Abstract": "Recombinant adenoviruses were used to overexpress green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused auxiliary Ca(2+) channel beta subunits (beta(1)-beta(4)) in cultured adult rat heart cells, to explore new dimensions of beta subunit functions in vivo. Distinct beta-GFP subunits distributed differentially between the surface sarcolemma, transverse elements, and nucleus in single heart cells. All beta-GFP subunits increased the native cardiac whole-cell L-type Ca(2+) channel current density, but produced distinctive effects on channel inactivation kinetics. The degree of enhancement of whole-cell current density was non-uniform between beta subunits, with a rank order of potency beta(2a) approximately equal to beta(4) > beta(1b) > beta(3). For each beta subunit, the increase in L-type current density was accompanied by a correlative increase in the maximal gating charge (Q(max)) moved with depolarization. However, beta subunits produced characteristic effects on single L-type channel gating, resulting in divergent effects on channel open probability (P(o)). Quantitative analysis and modelling of single-channel data provided a kinetic signature for each channel type. Spurred on by ambiguities regarding the molecular identity of the actual endogenous cardiac L-type channel beta subunit, we cloned a new rat beta(2) splice variant, beta(2b), from heart using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR. By contrast with beta(2a), expression of beta(2b) in heart cells yielded channels with a microscopic gating signature virtually identical to that of native unmodified channels. Our results provide novel insights into beta subunit functions that are unattainable in traditional heterologous expression studies, and also provide new perspectives on the molecular identity of the beta subunit component of cardiac L-type Ca(2+) channels. Overall, the work establishes a powerful experimental paradigm to explore novel functions of ion channel subunits in their native environments.",
