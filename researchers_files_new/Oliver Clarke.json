        "Abstract": "Tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting (TRIP8b) protein is a brain-specific subunit of Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, a class of voltage-gated channels modulated by cyclic nucleotides. While the interaction between TRIP8b and the cytosolic C terminus of the channel has been structurally described, the HCN:TRIP8b stoichiometry is less characterized. We employed single molecule mass photometry (MP) to image HCN4 particles purified in complex with TRIP8b. Our data show that four TRIP8b subunits are bound to the tetrameric HCN4 particle, confirming a 1:1 stoichiometry.",

Here we present structures of ankyrin-1 complexes purified from human erythrocytes. We reveal the architecture of a core complex of ankyrin-1, the Rhesus proteins RhAG and RhCE, the band 3 anion exchanger, protein 4.2, glycophorin A and glycophorin B. The distinct T-shaped conformation of membrane-bound ankyrin-1 facilitates recognition of RhCE and, unexpectedly, the water channel aquaporin-1. Together, our results uncover the molecular details of ankyrin-1 association with the erythrocyte membrane, and illustrate the mechanism of ankyrin-mediated membrane protein clustering.",

This allowed us to resolve the structure of the channel in the primed and open states at 3.4 and 4.0¬†√Ö, respectively, with a single dataset.

However, PfSERA5 does not exhibit any detectable protease activity and therefore the role of the PfSERA5 papain-like domain (PfSERA5E), thought to remain bound to its cognate prodomain, remains unknown. In this study, we present a revised structure of the central PfSERA5E domain at a resolution of 1.2 √Ö, and the first structure of the \"zymogen\" of this papain-like domain including its cognate prodomain (PfSERA5PE) to 2.2 √Ö resolution. PfSERA5PE is somewhat structurally similar to that of other known proenzymes, retaining the conserved overall folding and orientation of the prodomain through, and occluding, the archetypal papain-like catalytic triad \"active-site\" cleft, in the same reverse direction as conventional prodomains. Our findings are congruent with previously identified structures of PfSERA5E and of similar \"zymogens\" and provide a foundation for further investigation into the function of PfSERA5.",

        "Abstract": "The membrane-water interface forms a uniquely heterogeneous and geometrically constrained environment for enzymatic catalysis. Integral membrane enzymes sample three environments - the uniformly hydrophobic interior of the membrane, the aqueous extramembrane region, and the fuzzy, amphipathic interfacial region formed by the tightly packed headgroups of the components of the lipid bilayer. Depending on the nature of the substrates and the location of the site of chemical modification, catalysis may occur in each of these environments. The availability of structural information for alpha-helical enzyme families from each of these classes, as well as several beta-barrel enzymes from the bacterial outer membrane, has allowed us to review here the different ways in which each enzyme fold has adapted to the nature of the substrates, products, and the unique environment of the membrane. Our focus here is on enzymes that process lipidic substrates. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Bacterial Lipids edited by Russell E. Bishop.",

        "Abstract": "The type-1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel required for skeletal muscle contraction. Here, we present cryo-EM reconstructions of RyR1 in multiple functional states revealing the structural basis of channel gating and ligand-dependent activation. Binding sites for the channel activators Ca(2+), ATP, and caffeine were identified at interdomain interfaces of the C-terminal domain. Either ATP or Ca(2+) alone induces conformational changes in the cytoplasmic assembly (\"priming\"), without pore dilation. In contrast, in the presence of all three activating ligands, high-resolution reconstructions of open and closed states of RyR1 were obtained from the same sample, enabling analyses of conformational changes associated with¬†gating. Gating involves global conformational changes in the cytosolic assembly accompanied by local changes in the transmembrane domain, which include bending of the S6 transmembrane segment and consequent pore dilation, displacement, and deformation of the S4-S5 linker and conformational changes in the pseudo-voltage-sensor domain.",

        "Abstract": "Vitamin A homeostasis is critical to normal cellular function. Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is the sole specific carrier in the bloodstream for hydrophobic retinol, the main form in which vitamin A is transported. The integral membrane receptor STRA6 mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A by recognizing RBP-retinol to trigger release and internalization of retinol. We present the structure of zebrafish STRA6 determined to 3.9-angstrom resolution by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. STRA6 has one intramembrane and nine transmembrane helices in an intricate dimeric assembly. Unexpectedly, calmodulin is bound tightly to STRA6 in a noncanonical arrangement. Residues involved with RBP binding map to an archlike structure that covers a deep lipophilic cleft. This cleft is open to the membrane, suggesting a possible mode for internalization of retinol through direct diffusion into the lipid bilayer.",

        "Abstract": "The attachment of a sugar to a hydrophobic polyisoprenyl carrier is the first step for all extracellular glycosylation processes. The enzymes that perform these reactions, polyisoprenyl-glycosyltransferases (PI-GTs) include dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (DPMS), which generates the mannose donor for glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report the 3.0 √Ö resolution crystal structure of GtrB, a glucose-specific PI-GT from Synechocystis, showing a tetramer in which each protomer contributes two helices to a membrane-spanning bundle. The active site is 15 √Ö from the membrane, raising the question of how water-soluble and membrane-embedded substrates are brought into apposition for catalysis. A conserved juxtamembrane domain harbours disease mutations, which compromised activity in GtrB in vitro and in human DPM1 tested in zebrafish. We hypothesize a role of this domain in shielding the polyisoprenyl-phosphate for transport to the active site. Our results reveal the basis of PI-GT function, and provide a potential molecular explanation for DPM1-related disease.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol is critical for intracellular signalling and anchoring of carbohydrates and proteins to outer cellular membranes. The defining step in phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis is catalysed by CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases, transmembrane enzymes that use CDP-diacylglycerol as donor substrate for this reaction, and either inositol in eukaryotes or inositol phosphate in prokaryotes as the acceptor alcohol. Here we report the structures of a related enzyme, the phosphatidylinositol-phosphate synthase from Renibacterium salmoninarum, with and without bound CDP-diacylglycerol to 3.6 and 2.5 √Ö resolution, respectively. These structures reveal the location of the acceptor site, and the molecular determinants of substrate specificity and catalysis. Functional characterization of the 40%-identical ortholog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potential target for the development of novel anti-tuberculosis drugs, supports the proposed mechanism of substrate binding and catalysis. This work therefore provides a structural and functional framework to understand the mechanism of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate biosynthesis.",

Lack of sufficient structural detail has impeded understanding of RyR gating and regulation. Here we report the closed-state structure of the 2.3-megadalton complex of the rabbit skeletal muscle type 1 RyR (RyR1), solved by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at an overall resolution of 4.8¬†√Ö. We fitted a polyalanine-level model to all 3,757 ordered residues in each protomer, defining the transmembrane pore in unprecedented detail and placing all cytosolic domains as tertiary folds. The cytosolic assembly is built on an extended Œ±-solenoid scaffold connecting key regulatory domains to the pore. The RyR1 pore architecture places it in the six-transmembrane ion channel superfamily. A unique domain inserted between the second and third transmembrane helices interacts intimately with paired EF-hands originating from the Œ±-solenoid scaffold, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by Ca(2+).",

        "Abstract": "The CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase (CDP-AP) family of integral membrane enzymes catalyses the transfer of a substituted phosphate group from a CDP-linked donor to an alcohol acceptor. This is an essential reaction for phospholipid biosynthesis across all kingdoms of life, and it is catalysed solely by CDP-APs. Here we report the 2.0 √Ö resolution crystal structure of a representative CDP-AP from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The enzyme (AF2299) is a homodimer, with each protomer consisting of six transmembrane helices and an N-terminal cytosolic domain. A polar cavity within the membrane accommodates the active site, lined with the residues from an absolutely conserved CDP-AP signature motif (D(1)xxD(2)G(1)xxAR...G(2)xxxD(3)xxxD(4)). Structures in the apo, CMP-bound, CDP-bound and CDP-glycerol-bound states define functional roles for each of these eight conserved residues and allow us to propose a sequential, base-catalysed mechanism universal for CDP-APs, in which the fourth aspartate (D4) acts as the catalytic base.",

        "Abstract": "Cell membranes present a naturally impervious barrier to aqueous solutes, such that the physiochemical environment on either side of the lipid bilayer can substantially differ. Integral membrane proteins are embedded in this heterogeneous lipid environment, wherein the juxtaposition of apolar and polar molecular surfaces defines factors such as transverse orientation, the surface area available for oligomerisation and the symmetry of resultant assemblies. This chapter focuses on potassium channels -representative molecular pores that play a critical role in electrical signalling by enabling selective transport of K(+) ions across cell membranes. Oligomerization is central to K(+) channel action; individual subunits are nonfunctional and conduction, selectivity and gating involve manipulation of the common subunit interface of the tetramer. Regulation of channel activity can be viewed from the perspective that the pore of K(+) channels has coopted other proteins, utilizing a process of hetero-oligomerisation to absorb new functions that both enable the pore to respond to extrinsic signals and provide an electrical signature.",

        "Abstract": "Schistosomiasis is an infectious disease caused by parasites of the phylum platyhelminthe. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis pathway in Schistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni. Genomic, biochemical, and cell-based mechanistic studies provide evidence for a tripartite pathway, similar to that in humans including BH3-only proteins that are inhibited by prosurvival Bcl-2-like molecules, and Bax/Bak-like proteins that facilitate mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization. Because Bcl-2 proteins have been successfully targeted with \"BH3 mimetic\" drugs, particularly in the treatment of cancer, we investigated whether schistosome apoptosis pathways could provide targets for future antischistosomal drug discovery efforts. Accordingly, we showed that a schistosome prosurvival protein, sjA, binds ABT-737, a well-characterized BH3 mimetic. A crystal structure of sjA bound to a BH3 peptide provides direct evidence for the feasibility of developing BH3 mimetics to target Bcl-2 prosurvival proteins in schistosomes, suggesting an alternative application for this class of drugs beyond cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Potassium channels embedded in cell membranes employ gates to regulate K+ current. While a specific constriction in the permeation pathway has historically been implicated in gating, recent reports suggest that the signature ion selectivity filter located in the outer membrane leaflet may be equally important. Inwardly rectifying K+ channels also control the directionality of flow, using intracellular polyamines to stem ion efflux by a valve-like action. This study presents crystallographic evidence of interdependent gates in the conduction pathway and reveals the mechanism of polyamine block. Reorientation of the intracellular domains, concomitant with activation, instigates polyamine release from intracellular binding sites to block the permeation pathway. Conformational adjustments of the slide helices, achieved by rotation of the cytoplasmic assembly relative to the pore, are directly correlated to the ion configuration in the selectivity filter. Ion redistribution occurs irrespective of the constriction, suggesting a more expansive role of the selectivity filter in gating than previously appreciated.",

        "Title": "Metal binding affinities of Arabidopsis zinc and copper transporters: selectivities match the relative, but not the absolute, affinities of their amino-terminal domains.",
        "Abstract": "HMA2, HMA4, and HMA7 are three of the eight heavy metal transporting P(1B)-type ATPases in the simple plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The first two transport Zn(2+), and the third transports Cu(+). Each protein contains soluble N-terminal metal-binding domains (MBDs) that are essential for metal transport. While the MBD of HMA7 features a CxxC sequence motif characteristic of Cu(I) binding sites, those of HMA2 and HMA4 contain a CCxxE motif, unique for plant Zn(2+)-ATPases. The three MBDs HMA2n (residues 1-79), HMA4n (residues 1-96), and HMA7n (residues 56-127) and an HMA7/4n chimera were expressed in Escherichia coli. The chimera features the ICCTSE motif from HMA4n inserted in place of the native MTCAAC motif of HMA7n. Binding affinities for Zn(II) and Cu(I) of each MBD were determined by ligand competition with a number of chromophoric probes. The challenges of using these probes reliably were evaluated, and the relative affinities of the MBDs were verified by independent cross-checks. The affinities of HMA2n and HMA4n for Zn(II) are higher than that of HMA7n by a factor of 20-30, but the relative affinities for Cu(I) are inverted by a factor of 30-50. These relativities are consistent with their respective roles in metal selection and transportation. Chimera HMA7/4n binds Cu(I) with an affinity between those of HMA4n and HMA7n but binds Zn(II) more weakly than either parent protein does. The four MBDs bind Cu(I) more strongly than Zn(II) by factors of >10(6). It is apparent that the individual MBDs are not able to overcome the large thermodynamic preference for Cu(+) over Zn(2+). This information highlights the potential toxicity of Cu(+) in vivo and why copper sensor proteins are approximately 6 orders of magnitude more sensitive than zinc sensor proteins. Metal speciation must be controlled by multiple factors, including thermodynamics (affinity), kinetics (including protein-protein interactions), and compartmentalization. The structure of Zn(II)-bound HMA4n defined by NMR confirmed the predicted ferredoxin betaalphabetabetaalphabeta fold. A single Zn atom was modeled onto a metal-binding site with protein ligands comprising the two thiolates and the carboxylate of the CCxxE motif. The observed (113)Cd chemical shift in [(113)Cd]HMA4n was consistent with a Cd(II)S(2)OX (X = O or N) coordination sphere. The Zn(II) form of the Cu(I) transporter HMA7n is a monomer in solution but crystallized as a polymeric chain [(Zn(II)-HMA7n)(m)]. Each Zn(II) ion occupied a distorted tetrahedral site formed from two Cys ligands of the CxxC motif of one HMA7n molecule and the amino N and carbonyl O atoms of the N-terminal methionine of another.",

        "Abstract": "The sera genes of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium encode a family of unique proteins that are maximally expressed at the time of egress of parasites from infected red blood cells. These multi-domain proteins are unique, containing a central papain-like cysteine-protease fragment enclosed between the disulfide-linked N- and C-terminal domains. However, the central fragment of several members of this family, including serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5), contains a serine (S596) in place of the active-site cysteine. Here we report the crystal structure of the central protease-like domain of Plasmodium falciparum SERA5, revealing a number of anomalies in addition to the putative nucleophilic serine: (1) the structure of the putative active site is not conducive to binding substrate in the canonical cysteine-protease manner; (2) the side chain of D594 restricts access of substrate to the putative active site; and (3) the S(2) specificity pocket is occupied by the side chain of Y735, reducing this site to a small depression on the protein surface. Attempts to determine the structure in complex with known inhibitors were not successful. Thus, despite having revealed its structure, the function of the catalytic domain of SERA5 remains an enigma.",

        "Abstract": "Cross-beta amyloid is implicated in over 20 human diseases. Experiments suggest that specific sequence elements within amyloidogenic proteins play a major role in seeding amyloid formation. Identifying these seeding sequences is important for rationalizing the molecular mechanisms of amyloid formation and for elaborating therapeutic strategies that target amyloid. Theoretical techniques play an important role in facilitating the identification and structural characterization of putative seeding sequences; most amyloid species are not amenable to high resolution experimental structure techniques. In this study we have combined a coarse-grained physicochemical protein model with a highly efficient Monte Carlo sampling technique to identify amyloidogenic sequences in four proteins for which respective experimental peptide fragmentation data exist. Peptide sequences were defined as amyloidogenic if the ensemble structure predicted for three interacting peptides described a stable and regular three-stranded beta-sheet. For such peptides, free energies were calculated to provide a measure of amyloid propensity. The overall agreement between the experimental and predicted data is good, and we correctly identify several self-recognition motifs proposed to define the cross-beta amyloid fibril architectures of two of the proteins. Our results compare very favorably with those obtained using atomistic molecular dynamics methods, though our simulations are 30-40 times faster.",

        "Abstract": "Energy-based methods for calculating time-averaged peptide structures are important for rational peptide design, for defining local structure propensities in large protein chains, and for exploring the sequence determinants of amyloid formation. High-end methods are currently too slow to be practicable, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. The challenge is to create a method that runs quickly on limited computer resources and emulates reality sufficiently well. We have developed a simplified off-lattice protein model, incorporating semi-empirical physicochemical potentials, and combined it with an efficient Monte Carlo method for calculating time-averaged peptide structures. Reasonably accurate predictions are found for a set of small alpha-helical and beta-hairpin peptides, and we demonstrate a potential application in measuring local structure propensities in protein chains. Time-averaged structures have also been calculated for a set of small peptides known to form beta-amyloid fibrils. The simulations were of three interacting peptides, and in each case the time-averaged structure describes a three-stranded beta-sheet. The performance of our method in measuring the propensities of small peptides to self-associate into possible prefibrillar species compares favorably with more detailed and CPU-intensive approaches.",
