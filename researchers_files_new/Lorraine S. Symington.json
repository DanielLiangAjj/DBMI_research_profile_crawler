        "Abstract": "DNA replication stress is one of the primary causes of genome instability. In response to replication stress, cells can employ replication restart mechanisms that rely on homologous recombination to resume replication fork progression and preserve genome integrity. In this review, we provide an overview of various methods that have been developed to induce site-specific replication fork stalling or collapse in eukaryotic cells. In particular, we highlight recent studies of mechanisms of replication-associated recombination resulting from site-specific protein-DNA barriers and single-strand breaks, and we discuss the contributions of these findings to our understanding of the consequences of these forms of stress on genome stability.",

        "Abstract": "Single-strand breaks (SSBs) are one of the most common endogenous lesions and have the potential to give rise to cytotoxic double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication. To investigate the mechanism of replication fork collapse at SSBs and subsequent repair, we employed Cas9 nickase (nCas9) to generate site and strand-specific nicks in the budding yeast genome. We show that nCas9-induced nicks are converted to mostly double-ended DSBs during S-phase. We find that repair of replication-dependent DSBs requires homologous recombination (HR) and is independent of canonical non-homologous end joining. Consistent with a strong bias to repair these lesions using a sister chromatid template, we observe minimal induction of inter-chromosomal HR by nCas9. Using nCas9 and a gRNA to nick either the leading or lagging strand template, we carried out a genome-wide screen to identify factors necessary for the repair of replication-dependent DSBs. All the core HR genes were recovered in the screen with both gRNAs, but we recovered components of the replication-coupled nucleosome assembly (RCNA) pathway with only the gRNA targeting the leading strand template. By use of additional gRNAs, we find that the RCNA pathway is especially important to repair a leading strand fork collapse.",

Foldback priming at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is one mechanism proposed for the generation of inverted duplications. However, the other pathway steps have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that a DSB induced near natural inverted repeats drives high frequency inverted duplication in Sae2 and Mre11-deficient cells. We find that DNA polymerase δ proof-reading activity, but not Rad1 nuclease, trims the heterologous flaps formed after foldback annealing. Additionally, Pol32 is required for the generation of inverted duplications, suggesting that Pol δ catalyzes fill-in synthesis primed from the foldback to create a hairpin-capped chromosome that is subsequently replicated to form a dicentric inversion chromosome.

In yeast, the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex nicks 5'-terminated DSB ends to initiate nucleolytic processing of DSBs for repair by homologous recombination. How MRX-DNA interactions support 5' strand-specific nicking and how nicking is influenced by the chromatin context have remained elusive. Using a deep sequencing-based assay, we mapped MRX nicks at single-nucleotide resolution next to multiple DSBs in the yeast genome. We observed that the DNA end-binding Ku70-Ku80 complex directed DSB-proximal nicks and that repetitive MRX cleavage extended the length of resection tracts. We identified a sequence motif and a DNA meltability profile that is preferentially nicked by MRX. Furthermore, we found that nucleosomes as well as transcription impeded MRX incisions. Our findings suggest that local DNA sequence and chromatin features shape the activity of this central DSB repair complex.",

To gain insight into the mechanism of recombination between repeated sequences in the context of replication stress, we used a prokaryotic Tus/Ter barrier designed to induce transient replication fork stalling near inverted repeats in the budding yeast genome. Our study reveals that the replication fork block stimulates a unique recombination pathway dependent on Rad51 strand invasion and Rad52-Rad59 strand annealing activities, Mph1/Rad5 fork remodelers, Mre11/Exo1/Dna2 resection machineries, Rad1-Rad10 nuclease and DNA polymerase δ. Furthermore, we show recombination at stalled replication forks is limited by the Srs2 helicase and Mus81-Mms4/Yen1 nucleases. Physical analysis of the replication-associated recombinants revealed that half are associated with an inversion of sequence between the repeats. Based on our extensive genetic characterization, we propose a model for recombination of closely linked repeats that can robustly generate chromosome rearrangements.",

Typically, cells repair DSBs by either nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). The relative use of these two pathways depends on many factors, including cell cycle stage and the nature of the DNA ends. A critical determinant of repair pathway selection is the initiation of 5'→3' nucleolytic degradation of DNA ends, a process referred to as DNA end resection. End resection is essential to create single-stranded DNA overhangs, which serve as the substrate for the Rad51 recombinase to initiate HR and are refractory to NHEJ repair. Here, we review recent insights into the mechanisms of end resection, how it is regulated, and the pathological consequences of its dysregulation.",

        "Abstract": "Exposure to environmental mutagens but also cell-endogenous processes can create DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in a cell's genome. DSBs need to be repaired accurately and timely to ensure genomic integrity and cell survival. One major DSB repair mechanism, called homologous recombination, relies on the nucleolytic degradation of the 5'-terminated strands in a process termed end resection. Here, we review new insights into end resection with a focus on the mechanistic interplay of the nucleases, helicases, and accessory factors involved.",

        "Abstract": "DNA double strand breaks (DSB) are cytotoxic lesions that can lead to genome rearrangements and genomic instability, which are hallmarks of cancer. The two main DSB repair pathways are non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination (HR). While HR is generally highly accurate, it has the potential for rearrangements that occur directly or through intermediates generated during the repair process. Whole genome sequencing of cancers has revealed numerous types of structural rearrangement signatures that are often indicative of repair mediated by sequence homology. However, it can be challenging to delineate repair mechanisms from sequence analysis of rearrangement end products from cancer genomes, or even model systems, because the same rearrangements can be generated by different pathways. Here, we review homology-directed repair pathways and their consequences. Exploring those pathways can lead to a greater understanding of rearrangements that occur in cancer cells.",

        "Abstract": "Break-induced replication (BIR) is a mechanism used to heal one-ended DNA double-strand breaks, such as those formed at collapsed replication forks or eroded telomeres. Instead of utilizing a canonical replication fork, BIR is driven by a migrating D-loop and is associated with a high frequency of mutagenesis. Here we show that when BIR encounters an interstitial telomere sequence (ITS), the machinery frequently terminates, resulting in the formation of an ectopic telomere. The primary mechanism to convert the ITS to a functional telomere is by telomerase-catalyzed addition of telomeric repeats with homology-directed repair serving as a back-up mechanism. Termination of BIR and creation of an ectopic telomere is promoted by Mph1/FANCM helicase, which has the capacity to disassemble D-loops. Other sequences that have the potential to seed new telomeres but lack the unique features of a natural telomere sequence, do not terminate BIR at a significant frequency in wild-type cells. However, these sequences can form ectopic telomeres if BIR is made less processive. Our results support a model in which features of the ITS itself, such as the propensity to form secondary structures and telomeric protein binding, pose a challenge to BIR and increase the vulnerability of the D-loop to dissociation by helicases, thereby promoting ectopic telomere formation.",

        "Abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are common genome lesions that threaten genome stability and cell survival. Cells use sophisticated repair machineries to detect and heal DSBs. To study DSB repair pathways and associated factors, inducible site-specific endonucleases have proven to be fundamental tools. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, galactose-inducible rare-cutting endonucleases are commonly used to create a single DSB at a unique cleavage site. Galactose induction requires cell cultivation in suboptimal growth media, which is tedious especially when working with slow growing DSB repair mutants. Moreover, endonucleases that simultaneously create DSBs in multiple defined and unique loci of the yeast genome are not available, hindering studies of DSB repair in different genomic regions and chromatin contexts. Here, we present new tools to overcome these limitations. We employ a heterologous media-independent induction system to express the yeast HO endonuclease or bacterial restriction enzymes for single or multiple DSB formation, respectively. The systems facilitate tightly controlled and efficient DSB formation at defined genomic sites and will be valuable tools to study DSB repair at a local and genome-wide scale.",

For regions of the genome that are not repetitive, spontaneous recombination rates are too low to be detected by simple screening and require reporters where a recombination product can be selected. This chapter describes commonly used types of reporters where a gene is duplicated as direct repeats and both copies are mutated with different mutations, rendering the cell defective for the gene and auxotrophic for the gene product. Recombination between the two defective copies can result in a wild-type gene and a prototrophic phenotype for the cell. Methods to use these types of reporters to determine recombination rates between the two gene copies are described, and their use in monitoring both increased and decreased recombinations is discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Sae2 functions in the DNA damage response by controlling Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX)-catalyzed end resection, an essential step for homology-dependent repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs), and by attenuating DNA damage checkpoint signaling. Phosphorylation of Sae2 by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK1/Cdc28) activates the Mre11 endonuclease, while the physiological role of Sae2 phosphorylation by Mec1 and Tel1 checkpoint kinases is not fully understood. Here, we compare the phenotype of sae2 mutants lacking the main CDK (sae2-S267A) or Mec1 and Tel1 phosphorylation sites (sae2-5A) with sae2Δ and Mre11 nuclease defective (mre11-nd) mutants. The phosphorylation-site mutations confer DNA damage sensitivity, but not to the same extent as sae2Δ. The sae2-S267A mutation is epistatic to mre11-nd for camptothecin (CPT) sensitivity and synergizes with sgs1Δ, whereas sae2-5A synergizes with mre11-nd and exhibits epistasis with sgs1Δ. We find that attenuation of checkpoint signaling by Sae2 is mostly independent of Mre11 endonuclease activation but requires Mec1 and Tel1-dependent phosphorylation of Sae2. These results support a model whereby CDK-catalyzed phosphorylation of Sae2 activates resection via Mre11 endonuclease, whereas Sae2 phosphorylation by Mec1 and Tel1 promotes resection by the Dna2-Sgs1 and Exo1 pathways indirectly by dampening the DNA damage response.",

        "Abstract": "Break-induced replication (BIR) is a pathway of homology-directed repair that repairs one-ended DNA breaks, such as those formed at broken replication forks or uncapped telomeres. In contrast to conventional S phase DNA synthesis, BIR proceeds by a migrating D-loop and results in conservative synthesis of the nascent strands. DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ) initiates BIR; however, it is not known whether synthesis of the invading strand switches to a different polymerase or how the complementary strand is synthesized. By using alleles of the replicative DNA polymerases that are permissive for ribonucleotide incorporation, thus generating a signature of their action in the genome that can be identified by hydrolytic end sequencing, we show that Pol δ replicates both the invading and the complementary strand during BIR. In support of this conclusion, we show that depletion of Pol δ from cells reduces BIR, whereas depletion of Pol ε has no effect.",

        "Abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are hazardous lesions that threaten genome integrity and cell survival. The DNA damage response (DDR) safeguards the genome by sensing DSBs, halting cell cycle progression and promoting repair through either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). The Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 (MRX/N) complex is central to the DDR through its structural, enzymatic, and signaling roles. The complex tethers DNA ends, activates the Tel1/ATM kinase, resolves protein-bound or hairpin-capped DNA ends, and maintains telomere homeostasis. In addition to its role at DSBs, MRX/N associates with unperturbed replication forks, as well as stalled replication forks, to ensure complete DNA synthesis and to prevent chromosome rearrangements. Here, we summarize the significant progress made in characterizing the MRX/N complex and its various activities in chromosome metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "The yeast Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex has structural, signaling, and catalytic functions in the response to DNA damage. Xrs2, the eukaryotic-specific component of the complex, is required for nuclear import of Mre11 and Rad50 and to recruit the Tel1 kinase to damage sites. We show that nuclear-localized MR complex (Mre11-NLS) catalyzes homology-dependent repair without Xrs2, but MR cannot activate Tel1, and it fails to tether DSBs, resulting in sensitivity to genotoxins, replisome instability, and increased gross chromosome rearrangements (GCRs). Fusing the Tel1 interaction domain from Xrs2 to Mre11-NLS is sufficient to restore telomere elongation and Tel1 signaling to Xrs2-deficient cells. Furthermore, Tel1 stabilizes Mre11-DNA association, and this stabilization function becomes important for DNA damage resistance in the absence of Xrs2. Enforcing Tel1 recruitment to the nuclear MR complex fully rescues end tethering and stalled replication fork stability, and suppresses GCRs, highlighting important roles for Xrs2 and Tel1 to ensure optimal MR activity.",

        "Abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are cytotoxic lesions that must be accurately repaired to maintain genome stability. Replication protein A (RPA) plays an important role in homology-dependent repair of DSBs by protecting the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediates formed by end resection and by facilitating Rad51 loading. We found that hypomorphic mutants of RFA1 that support intra-chromosomal homologous recombination are profoundly defective for repair processes involving long tracts of DNA synthesis, in particular break-induced replication (BIR). The BIR defects of the rfa1 mutants could be partially suppressed by eliminating the Sgs1-Dna2 resection pathway, suggesting that Dna2 nuclease attacks the ssDNA formed during end resection when not fully protected by RPA. Overexpression of Rad51 was also found to suppress the rfa1 BIR defects. We suggest that Rad51 binding to the ssDNA formed by excessive end resection and during D-loop migration can partially compensate for dysfunctional RPA.",

Xrs2/Nbs1 is essential for nuclear translocation of Mre11, but its role as a component of the complex is not well defined. Here, we demonstrate that nuclear localization of Mre11 (Mre11-NLS) is able to bypass several functions of Xrs2, including DNA end resection, meiosis, hairpin resolution, and cellular resistance to clastogens. Using purified components, we show that the MR complex has equivalent activity to MRX in cleavage of protein-blocked DNA ends. Although Xrs2 physically interacts with Sae2, we found that end resection in its absence remains Sae2 dependent in vivo and in vitro. MRE11-NLS was unable to rescue the xrs2Δ defects in Tel1/ATM kinase signaling and non-homologous end joining, consistent with the role of Xrs2 as a chaperone and adaptor protein coordinating interactions between the MR complex and other repair proteins.",

        "Abstract": "The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR) is initiated by nucleolytic degradation of the 5'-terminated strands in a process termed end resection. End resection generates 3'-single-stranded DNA tails, substrates for Rad51 to catalyze homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange, and for activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. The commonly accepted view is that end resection occurs by a two-step mechanism. In the first step, Sae2/CtIP activates the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 (MRX/N) complex to endonucleolytically cleave the 5'-terminated DNA strands close to break ends, and in the second step Exo1 and/or Dna2 nucleases extend the resected tracts to produce long 3'-ssDNA-tailed intermediates. Initiation of resection commits a cell to repair a DSB by HR because long ssDNA overhangs are poor substrates for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Thus, the initiation of end resection has emerged as a critical control point for repair pathway choice. Here, I review recent studies on the mechanism of end resection and how this process is regulated to ensure the most appropriate repair outcome.",

        "Abstract": "Foldback priming at DNA double-stranded breaks is one mechanism proposed to initiate palindromic gene amplification, a common feature of cancer cells. Here, we show that small (5-9 bp) inverted repeats drive the formation of large palindromic duplications, the major class of chromosomal rearrangements recovered from yeast cells lacking Sae2 or the Mre11 nuclease. RPA dysfunction increased the frequency of palindromic duplications in Sae2 or Mre11 nuclease-deficient cells by ∼ 1,000-fold, consistent with intra-strand annealing to create a hairpin-capped chromosome that is subsequently replicated to form a dicentric isochromosome. The palindromic duplications were frequently associated with duplication of a second chromosome region bounded by a repeated sequence and a telomere, suggesting the dicentric chromosome breaks and repairs by recombination between dispersed repeats to acquire a telomere. We propose secondary structures within single-stranded DNA are potent instigators of genome instability, and RPA and Mre11-Sae2 play important roles in preventing their formation and propagation, respectively.",

Microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is an error-prone repair mechanism that involves alignment of microhomologous sequences internal to the broken ends before joining, and is associated with deletions and insertions that mark the original break site, as well as chromosome translocations. Whether MMEJ has a physiological role or is simply a back-up repair mechanism is a matter of debate. Here we review recent findings pertaining to the mechanism of MMEJ and discuss its role in normal and cancer cells.",

        "Abstract": "The Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/NBS1 (MRX/N) nuclease/ATPase complex plays structural and catalytic roles in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and is the DNA damage sensor for Tel1/ATM kinase activation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sae2 can function with MRX to initiate 5'-3' end resection and also plays an important role in attenuation of DNA damage signaling. Here we describe a class of mre11 alleles that suppresses the DNA damage sensitivity of sae2Δ cells by accelerating turnover of Mre11 at DNA ends, shutting off the DNA damage checkpoint and allowing cell cycle progression. The mre11 alleles do not suppress the end resection or hairpin-opening defects of the sae2Δ mutant, indicating that these functions of Sae2 are not responsible for DNA damage resistance. The purified M(P110L)RX complex shows reduced binding to single- and double-stranded DNA in vitro relative to wild-type MRX, consistent with the increased turnover of Mre11 from damaged sites in vivo. Furthermore, overproduction of Mre11 causes DNA damage sensitivity only in the absence of Sae2. Together, these data suggest that it is the failure to remove Mre11 from DNA ends and attenuate Rad53 kinase signaling that causes hypersensitivity of sae2Δ cells to clastogens.",

        "Abstract": "Replication protein A (RPA) is the main eukaryotic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein, having essential roles in all DNA metabolic reactions involving ssDNA. RPA binds ssDNA with high affinity, thereby preventing the formation of secondary structures and protecting ssDNA from the action of nucleases, and directly interacts with other DNA processing proteins. Here, we discuss recent results supporting the idea that one function of RPA is to prevent annealing between short repeats that can lead to chromosome rearrangements by microhomology-mediated end joining or the formation of hairpin structures that are substrates for structure-selective nucleases. We suggest that replication fork catastrophe caused by depletion of RPA could result from cleavage of secondary structures by nucleases, and that failure to cleave hairpin structures formed at DNA ends could lead to gene amplification. These studies highlight the important role RPA plays in maintaining genome integrity.",

However, there is an important link between mitotic and meiotic recombination (covered in the forthcoming chapter by Hunter et al. 2015) and many of the functions are evolutionarily conserved.

        "Abstract": "Research into the complex genetic underpinnings of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is entering a new era with the arrival of site-specific genome engineering. Previously restricted only to model systems but now expanded to most laboratory organisms, and even to humans for experimental gene therapy studies, this technology allows researchers to rapidly generate previously unattainable genetic modifications. This technological advance is dependent on DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR), specifically homologous recombination in the case of Plasmodium. Our understanding of DSBR in malaria parasites, however, is based largely on assumptions and knowledge taken from other model systems, which do not always hold true in Plasmodium. Here we describe the causes of double-strand breaks, the mechanisms of DSBR, and the differences between model systems and P. falciparum. These mechanisms drive basic parasite functions, such as meiosis, antigen diversification, and copy number variation, and allow the parasite to continually evolve in the contexts of host immune pressure and drug selection. Finally, we discuss the new technologies that leverage DSBR mechanisms to accelerate genetic investigations into this global infectious pathogen.",

        "Abstract": "RecA/Rad51 catalyzed pairing of homologous DNA strands, initiated by polymerization of the recombinase on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), is a universal feature of homologous recombination (HR). Generation of ssDNA from a double-strand break (DSB) requires nucleolytic degradation of the 5'-terminated strands to generate 3'-ssDNA tails, a process referred to as 5'-3' end resection. The RecBCD helicase-nuclease complex is the main end-processing machine in Gram-negative bacteria. Mre11-Rad50 and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 can play a direct role in end resection in archaea and eukaryota, respectively, by removing end-blocking lesions and act indirectly by recruiting the helicases and nucleases responsible for extensive resection. In eukaryotic cells, the initiation of end resection has emerged as a critical regulatory step to differentiate between homology-dependent and end-joining repair of DSBs.",

Here we used a chromosomal end-joining assay to determine the genetic requirements for MMEJ in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that end resection influences the ability to expose microhomologies; however, it is not rate limiting for MMEJ in wild-type cells. The frequency of MMEJ increased by up to 350-fold in rfa1 hypomorphic mutants, suggesting that replication protein A (RPA) bound to the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhangs formed by resection prevents spontaneous annealing between microhomologies. In vitro, the mutant RPA complexes were unable to fully extend ssDNA and were compromised in their ability to prevent spontaneous annealing. We propose that the helix-destabilizing activity of RPA channels ssDNA intermediates from mutagenic MMEJ to error-free homologous recombination, thus preserving genome integrity.",

        "Abstract": "Chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs) that have only one end with homology to a donor duplex undergo repair by strand invasion followed by replication to the chromosome terminus (break-induced replication, BIR). Using a transformation-based assay system, it was previously shown that BIR could occur by several rounds of strand invasion, DNA synthesis, and dissociation. Here we describe a modification of the transformation-based assay to facilitate detection of switching between donor templates during BIR by genetic selection in diploid yeast. In addition to the expected recovery of template switch products, we found a high frequency of recombination between chromosome homologs during BIR, suggesting transfer of the DSB from the transforming linear DNA to the donor chromosome, initiating secondary recombination events. The frequency of BIR increased in the mph1Δ mutant, but the percentage of template switch events was significantly decreased, revealing an important role for Mph1 in promoting BIR-associated template switching. In addition, we show that the Mus81, Rad1, and Yen1 structure-selective nucleases act redundantly to facilitate BIR.",

Here we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mph1 helicase prevents crossovers between ectopic sequences by removing substrates for Mus81-Mms4 or Rad1-Rad10 cleavage. A role for Yen1 is only apparent in the absence of Mus81. Cells lacking Mph1 and the three nucleases are highly defective in the repair of a single DSB, suggesting that the recombination intermediates that accumulate cannot be processed by the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex (STR). Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic joint molecules (JMs) accumulate transiently in the mph1Δ mutant and persistently when Mus81 is eliminated. Furthermore, the ectopic JMs formed in the mus81Δ mutant contain a single Holliday junction (HJ) explaining why STR is unable to process them. We suggest that Mph1 and Mus81-Mms4 recognize an early strand exchange intermediate and direct repair to noncrossover or crossover outcomes, respectively.",

Here, we used BrdU incorporation to track DNA synthesis during BIR and found that the newly synthesized strands segregate with the broken chromosome, indicative of a conservative mode of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, we show the frequency of BIR is reduced and product formation is progressively delayed when the donor is placed at an increasing distance from the telomere, consistent with replication by a migrating D-loop from the site of initiation to the telomere.",

RPA directly participates in DNA double-strand break repair by stimulating 5'-3' end resection by the Sgs1/BLM helicase and Dna2 endonuclease in vitro. Here we investigated the role of RPA in end resection in vivo, using a heat-inducible degron system that allows rapid conditional depletion of RPA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that RPA depletion eliminated both the Sgs1-Dna2- and Exo1-dependent extensive resection pathways and synergized with mre11Δ to prevent end resection. The short single-stranded DNA tails formed in the absence of RPA were unstable due to 3' strand loss and the formation of fold-back hairpin structures that required resection initiation and Pol32-dependent DNA synthesis. Thus, RPA is required to generate ssDNA, and also to protect ssDNA from degradation and inappropriate annealing that could lead to genome rearrangements.",

Crossover products were not recovered from the mus81Δ rad1Δ yen1Δ triple mutant, indicating that all three nucleases participate in processing recombination intermediates that form between dispersed repeats. We suggest a new mechanism for crossovers that involves Rad1-Rad10 clipping and resolution of a single Holliday junction-containing intermediate by Mus81-Mms4 or Yen1 cleavage or by replication. Consistent with the model, we show accumulation of Rad1-dependent joint molecules in the mus81Δ yen1Δ mutant.",

        "Abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are cytotoxic lesions that can result in mutagenic events or cell death if left unrepaired or repaired inappropriately. Cells use two major pathways for DSB repair: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). The choice between these pathways depends on the phase of the cell cycle and the nature of the DSB ends. A critical determinant of repair pathway choice is the initiation of 5'-3' resection of DNA ends, which commits cells to homology-dependent repair, and prevents repair by classical NHEJ. Here, we review the components of the end resection machinery, the role of end structure, and the cell-cycle phase on resection and the interplay of end processing with NHEJ.",

        "Abstract": "Recombination between inverted repeats is RAD52 dependent, but reduced only modestly in the rad51Δ mutant. RAD59 is required for RAD51-independent inverted-repeat recombination, but no clear mechanism for how recombination occurs in the absence of RAD51 has emerged. Because Rad59 is thought to function as an accessory factor for the single-strand annealing activity of Rad52 one possible mechanism for spontaneous recombination could be by strand annealing between repeats at a stalled replication fork. Here we demonstrate the importance of the Rad52 single-strand annealing activity for generating recombinants by showing suppression of the rad52Δ, rad51Δ rad52Δ and rad52Δ rad59Δ inverted-repeat recombination defects by the rfa1-D228Y mutation. In addition, formation of recombinants in the rad51Δ mutant was sensitive to the distance between the inverted repeats, consistent with a replication-based mechanism. Deletion of RAD5 or RAD18, which are required for error-free post-replication repair, reduced the recombination rate in the rad59Δ mutant, but not in wild type. These data are consistent with RAD51-independent recombinants arising by a faulty template switch mechanism that is distinct from nascent strand template switching.",

        "Abstract": "Homology-dependent repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiates by the 5'-3' resection of the DNA ends to create single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), the substrate for Rad51/RecA binding. Long tracts of ssDNA are also required for activation of the ATR-mediated checkpoint response. Thus, identifying the proteins required and the underlying mechanism for DNA end resection has been an intense area of investigation. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae show that end resection takes place in two steps. Initially, a short oligonucleotide tract is removed from the 5' strand to create an early intermediate with a short 3' overhang. Then in a second step the early intermediate is rapidly processed generating an extensive tract of ssDNA. The first step is dependent on the highly conserved Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex and Sae2, while the second step employs the exonuclease Exo1 and/or the helicase-topoisomerase complex Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 with the endonuclease Dna2. Here we review recent in vitro and in vivo findings that shed more light into the mechanisms of DSB processing in mitotic and meiotic DSB repair as well as in telomere metabolism.",

The identity of the resolvase(s) that functions in vivo has yet to be established, although several proteins able to cut HJs in vitro have been identified as candidates in yeasts and mammals. Using an assay to detect unselected products of mitotic recombination, we found a significant decrease in crossovers in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mus81Δ mutant. Yen1 serves a backup function responsible for resolving intermediates in mus81Δ mutants, or when conversion tracts are short. In the absence of both Mus81 and Yen1, intermediates are not channeled exclusively to noncrossover recombinants, but instead are processed by Pol32-dependent break-induced replication (BIR). The channeling of recombination from reciprocal exchange to BIR results in greatly increased spontaneous loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and chromosome mis-segregation in the mus81Δ yen1Δ mutant, typical of the genomic instability found in tumor cells.",

We show that in the absence of end protection by Ku, the requirement for the MRX complex is bypassed and resection is executed by Exo1. In contrast, both the Exo1 and Sgs1 resection pathways contribute to DSB processing in the absence of Ku and Sae2 or when the MRX complex is intact, but functionally compromised by elimination of the Mre11 nuclease activity. The ionizing radiation sensitivity of a mutant defective for extensive resection (exo1Δ sgs1Δ) cannot be suppressed by the yku70Δ mutation, indicating that Ku suppression is specific to the initiation of resection. We provide evidence that replication-associated DSBs need to be processed by Sae2 for repair by homologous recombination unless Ku is absent. Finally, we show that the presence of Ku exacerbates DNA end-processing defects established in the sae2Δ sgs1Δ mutant, leading to its lethality.",

        "Abstract": "Homology-dependent repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by gene conversion involves short tracts of DNA synthesis and limited loss of heterozygosity (LOH). For DSBs that present only one end, repair occurs by invasion into a homologous sequence followed by replication to the end of the chromosome resulting in extensive LOH, a process called break-induced replication (BIR). We developed a BIR assay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae consisting of a plasmid with a telomere seeding sequence separated from sequence homologous to chromosome III by an I-SceI endonuclease recognition site. Following cleavage of the plasmid by I-SceI in vivo, de novo telomere synthesis occurs at one end of the vector, and the other end invades at the homologous sequence on chromosome III and initiates replication to the end of the chromosome to generate a stable chromosome fragment (CF). BIR was infrequent in wild-type cells due to degradation of the linearized vector. However, in the exo1Delta sgs1Delta mutant, which is defective in the 5'-3' resection of DSBs, the frequency of BIR was increased by 39-fold. Extension of the invading end of the plasmid was detected by physical analysis two hours after induction of the I-SceI endonuclease in the wild-type exo1Delta, sgs1Delta, and exo1Delta sgs1Delta mutants, but fully repaired products were only visible in the exo1Delta sgs1Delta mutant. The inhibitory effect of resection was less in a plasmid-chromosome gene conversion assay, compared to BIR, and products were detected by physical assay in the wild-type strain. The rare chromosome rearrangements due to BIR template switching at repeated sequences were increased in the exo1Delta sgs1Delta mutant, suggesting that reduced resection can decrease the fidelity of homologous recombination.",

To identify novel exo- and endo-nucleases that might function in DNA repair, we undertook a proteomic screen making use of the movable ORF (MORF) library of yeast expression plasmids. This library consists of 5,854 yeast strains each expressing a unique yeast ORF fused to a tripartite tag consisting of His(6), an HA epitope, a protease 3C cleavage site, and the IgG-binding domain (ZZ) from protein A, under the control of the GAL1 promoter for inducible expression. Pools of proteins were partially purified on IgG sepharose and tested for nuclease activity using three different radiolabeled DNA substrates. Several known nucleases and phosphatases were identified, as well as two new members of the histidine phosphatase superfamily, which includes phosphoglycerate mutases and phosphatases. Subsequent characterization revealed YDR051c/Det1 to be an acid phosphatase with broad substrate specificity, whereas YOR283w has a broad pH range and hydrolyzes hydrophilic phosphorylated substrates. Although no new nuclease activities were identified from this screen, we did find phosphatase activity associated with a protein of unknown function, YOR283w, and with the recently characterized protein Det1. This knowledge should guide further genetic and biochemical characterization of these proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are deleterious DNA lesions and if left unrepaired result in severe genomic instability. Cells use two main pathways to repair DSBs: homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) depending on the phase of the cell cycle and the nature of the DSB ends. A key step where pathway choice is exerted is in the 'licensing' of 5'-3' resection of the ends to produce recombinogenic 3' single-stranded tails. These tails are substrate for binding by Rad51 to initiate pairing and strand invasion with homologous duplex DNA. Moreover, the single-stranded DNA generated after end processing is important to activate the DNA damage response. The mechanism of end processing is the focus of this review and we will describe recent findings that shed light on this important initiating step for HR. The conserved MRX/MRN complex appears to be a major regulator of DNA end processing. Sae2/CtIP functions with the MRX complex, either to activate the Mre11 nuclease or via the intrinsic endonuclease, in an initial step to trim the DSB ends. In a second step, redundant systems remove long tracts of DNA to reveal extensive 3' single-stranded tails. One system is dependent on the helicase Sgs1 and the nuclease Dna2, and the other on the 5'-3' exonuclease Exo1.",

        "Abstract": "The Rad51 paralogs Rad55 and Rad57 form a heterodimer required to mediate the formation and/or stabilization of the Rad51 filament. To further characterize the function of Rad55-Rad57, we used a combination of rad57 partial suppressors to determine whether the DNA repair and recombination defects of the rad57 mutant could be completely suppressed. The combination of all suppressors, elevated temperature, srs2, rad51-I345T, and mating-type (MAT) heterozygosity resulted in almost complete suppression of the rad57 mutant defect in the recruitment of Rad51 to DNA-damaged sites, as well as survival in response to ionizing radiation and camptothecin. In a physical assay to monitor the kinetics of double-strand-break (DSB)-induced gene conversion, the rad57 mutant defect was effectively suppressed by srs2 and MAT heterozygosity, but these same suppressors failed to suppress the spontaneous recombination defect. Thus the Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer appears to have a unique function in spontaneous recombination that is not essential for DSB repair. Furthermore, we investigated the currently unknown mechanism of rad57 suppression by MAT heterozygosity and found that it is independent of DNL4.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination is an error-free mechanism for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Most DSB repair events occur by gene conversion limiting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for markers downstream of the site of repair and restricting deleterious chromosome rearrangements. DSBs with only one end available for repair undergo strand invasion into a homologous duplex DNA, followed by replication to the chromosome end (break-induced replication [BIR]), leading to LOH for all markers downstream of the site of strand invasion. Using a transformation-based assay system, we show that most of the apparent BIR events that arise in diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae rad51Delta mutants are due to half crossovers instead of BIR. These events lead to extensive LOH because one arm of chromosome III is deleted. This outcome is also observed in pol32Delta and pol3-ct mutants, defective for components of the DNA polymerase delta (Pol delta) complex. The half crossovers formed in Pol delta complex mutants show evidence of limited homology-dependent DNA synthesis and are partially Mus81 dependent, suggesting that strand invasion occurs and the stalled intermediate is subsequently cleaved. In contrast to rad51Delta mutants, the Pol delta complex mutants are proficient for repair of a 238-bp gap by gene conversion. Thus, the BIR defect observed for rad51 mutants is due to strand invasion failure, whereas the Pol delta complex mutants are proficient for strand invasion but unable to complete extensive tracts of recombination-initiated DNA synthesis.",

        "Abstract": "We previously identified several rad51 gain-of-function alleles that partially suppress the requirement for RAD55 and RAD57 in DNA repair. To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of these alleles, we compared the activities of Rad51-V328A, Rad51-P339S and Rad51-I345T with wild-type Rad51, for DNA binding, filament stability, strand exchange and interaction with the antirecombinase helicase, Srs2. These alleles were chosen because they show the highest activity in suppression of ionizing radiation sensitivity of the rad57 mutant, and Val 328 and Ile 345 are conserved in the human Rad51 protein. All three mutant proteins exhibited higher affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and showed more robust strand exchange activity with oligonucleotide substrates than wild-type Rad51, with the Rad51-I345T and Rad51-V328A proteins displaying higher activity than Rad51-P339S. However, the Srs2 antirecombinase was able to disrupt Rad51-ssDNA complexes formed with all the mutant proteins. In vivo, the rad51-I345T mutant strain exhibited high resistance to methyl methane sulfonate that was dependent on functional SRS2. These results suggest the Srs2 translocase is able to disrupt Rad51-ssDNA complexes at stalled replication forks, but in the absence of Srs2 the enhanced DNA binding of the Rad51-I345T protein is detrimental to cell survival.",

        "Abstract": "DNA ends exposed after introduction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) undergo 5'-3' nucleolytic degradation to generate single-stranded DNA, the substrate for binding by the Rad51 protein to initiate homologous recombination. This process is poorly understood in eukaryotes, but several factors have been implicated, including the Mre11 complex (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/NBS1), Sae2/CtIP/Ctp1 and Exo1. Here we demonstrate that yeast Exo1 nuclease and Sgs1 helicase function in alternative pathways for DSB processing. Novel, partially resected intermediates accumulate in a double mutant lacking Exo1 and Sgs1, which are poor substrates for homologous recombination. The early processing step that generates partly resected intermediates is dependent on Sae2. When Sae2 is absent, in addition to Exo1 and Sgs1, unprocessed DSBs accumulate and homology-dependent repair fails. These results suggest a two-step mechanism for DSB processing during homologous recombination. First, the Mre11 complex and Sae2 remove a small oligonucleotide(s) from the DNA ends to form an early intermediate. Second, Exo1 and/or Sgs1 rapidly process this intermediate to generate extensive tracts of single-stranded DNA that serve as substrate for Rad51.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is considered to be an error-free mechanism for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Indeed, most DSB repair events occur by a non-crossover mechanism limiting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for markers downstream of the site of repair and preventing chromosome rearrangements. However, DSBs that arise by replication fork collapse or by erosion of uncapped telomeres have only one free end and are thought to repair by strand invasion into a homologous duplex DNA followed by replication to the chromosome end (break-induced replication, BIR). As BIR from one of the two ends of a DSB would result in a long tract of LOH it suggests BIR is suppressed when DSBs have two ends in order for repair to occur by a more conservative HR mechanism. Recent studies showed that BIR can occur by several rounds of strand invasion, DNA synthesis and dissociation resulting in chromosome rearrangements when dissociation and reinvasion occur within dispersed repeated sequences. Thus template switching BIR can be highly mutagenic and this process could be important for genome evolution and disease development.",

        "Abstract": "The Mre11 and Pso2 nucleases function in homologous recombination and interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair pathways, respectively, while the Exo1 nuclease is involved in homologous recombination and mismatch repair. Characterization of the sensitivity of single, double and triple mutants for these nucleases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to various DNA damaging agents reveals complex interactions that depend on the type of DNA damage. The pso2 mutant is uniquely sensitive to agents that generate ICLs and mre11-H125N shows the highest sensitivity of the single mutants for ionizing radiation and methyl methane sulfonate. However, elimination of all three nucleases confers higher sensitivity to IR than any of the single or double mutant combinations indicating a high degree of redundancy and versatility in the response to DNA damage. In response to ICL agents, double-strand breaks are still formed in the triple nuclease mutant indicating that none of these nucleases are responsible for unhooking cross-links.",

        "Abstract": "Rad51 requires a number of other proteins, including the Rad51 paralogs, for efficient recombination in vivo. Current evidence suggests that the yeast Rad51 paralogs, Rad55 and Rad57, are important in formation or stabilization of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament. To gain further insights into the function of the Rad51 paralogs, reporters were designed to measure spontaneous or double-strand break (DSB)-induced sister or nonsister recombination. Spontaneous sister chromatid recombination (SCR) was reduced 6000-fold in the rad57 mutant, significantly more than in the rad51 mutant. Although the DSB-induced recombination defect of rad57 was suppressed by overexpression of Rad51, elevated temperature, or expression of both mating-type alleles, the rad57 defect in spontaneous SCR was not strongly suppressed by these same factors. In addition, the UV sensitivity of the rad57 mutant was not strongly suppressed by MAT heterozygosity, even though Rad51 foci were restored under these conditions. This lack of suppression suggests that Rad55 and Rad57 have different roles in the recombinational repair of stalled replication forks compared with DSB repair. Furthermore, these data suggest that most spontaneous SCR initiates from single-stranded gaps formed at stalled replication forks rather than DSBs.",

        "Title": "Template switching during break-induced replication.",
        "Abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are potentially lethal lesions that arise spontaneously during normal cellular metabolism, as a consequence of environmental genotoxins or radiation, or during programmed recombination processes. Repair of DSBs by homologous recombination generally occurs by gene conversion resulting from transfer of information from an intact donor duplex to both ends of the break site of the broken chromosome. In mitotic cells, gene conversion is rarely associated with reciprocal exchange and thus limits loss of heterozygosity for markers downstream of the site of repair and restricts potentially deleterious chromosome rearrangements. DSBs that arise by replication fork collapse or by erosion of uncapped telomeres have only one free end and are thought to repair by strand invasion into a homologous duplex DNA followed by replication to the chromosome end (break-induced replication, BIR). BIR from one of the two ends of a DSB would result in loss of heterozygosity, suggesting that BIR is suppressed when DSBs have two ends so that repair occurs by the more conservative gene conversion mechanism. Here we show that BIR can occur by several rounds of strand invasion, DNA synthesis and dissociation. We further show that chromosome rearrangements can occur during BIR if dissociation and reinvasion occur within dispersed repeated sequences. This dynamic process could function to promote gene conversion by capture of the displaced invading strand at two-ended DSBs to prevent BIR.",

        "Abstract": "The nucleoprotein filament formed by Rad51 polymerization on single-stranded DNA is essential for homologous pairing and strand exchange. ATP binding is required for Rad51 nucleoprotein filament formation and strand exchange, but ATP hydrolysis is not required for these functions in vitro. Previous studies have shown that a yeast strain expressing the rad51-K191R allele is sensitive to ionizing radiation, suggesting an important role for ATP hydrolysis in vivo. The recruitment of Rad51-K191R to double-strand breaks is defective in vivo, and this phenotype can be suppressed by elimination of the Srs2 helicase, an antagonist of Rad51 filament formation. The phenotype of the rad51-K191R strain is also suppressed by overexpression of Rad54. In vitro, the Rad51-K191R protein exhibits a slight decrease in binding to DNA, consistent with the defect in presynaptic filament formation. However, the rad51-K191R mutation is dominant in heterozygous diploids, indicating that the defect is not due simply to reduced affinity for DNA. We suggest the Rad51-K191R protein either forms an altered filament or is defective in turnover, resulting in a reduced pool of free protein available for DNA binding.",

        "Abstract": "The Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex is involved in DNA double-strand break repair, telomere maintenance, and the intra-S phase checkpoint. The Mre11 subunit has nuclease activity in vitro, but the role of the nuclease in DNA repair and telomere maintenance remains controversial. We generated six mre11 alleles with substitutions of conserved residues within the Mre11-phosphoesterase motifs and compared the phenotypes conferred, as well as exonuclease activity and complex formation, by the mutant proteins. Substitutions of Asp16 conferred the most severe DNA repair and telomere length defects. Interactions between Mre11-D16A or Mre11-D16N and Rad50 or Xrs2 were severely compromised, whereas the mre11 alleles with greater DNA repair proficiency also exhibited stable complex formation. At all of the targeted residues, alanine substitution resulted in a more severe defect in DNA repair compared to the more conservative asparagine substitutions, but all of the mutant proteins exhibited <2% of the exonuclease activity observed for wild-type Mre11. Our results show that the structural integrity of the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex is more important than the catalytic activity of the Mre11 nuclease for the overall functions of the complex in vegetative cells.",

        "Abstract": "Targeted gene replacement (TGR) in yeast and mammalian cells is initiated by the two free ends of the linear targeting molecule, which invade their respective homologous sequences in the chromosome, leading to replacement of the targeted locus with a selectable gene from the targeting DNA. To study the postinvasion steps in recombination, we examined the effects of DNA structure-specific proteins on TGR frequency and heteroduplex DNA formation. In strains deleted of RAD1, MSH2, or MSH3, we find that the frequency of TGR is reduced and the mechanism of TGR is altered while the reverse is true for deletion of SGS1, suggesting that Rad1 and Msh2:Msh3 facilitate TGR while Sgs1 opposes it. The altered mechanism of TGR in the absence of Msh2:Msh3 and Rad1 reveals a separate role for these proteins in suppressing an alternate gene replacement pathway in which incorporation of both homology regions from a single strand of targeting DNA into heteroduplex with the targeted locus creates a mismatch between the selectable gene on the targeting DNA and the targeted gene in the chromosome.",

        "Title": "Gene targeting in yeast is initiated by two independent strand invasions.",
        "Abstract": "To study the mechanism of gene targeting, we examined heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) formation during targeting of two separate chromosomal locations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We examined both replacement of the entire gene with a heterologous selectable marker and correction of a single base pair insertion mutation by gene targeting, and in all cases our results were consistent with separate strand invasion/resolution at the two ends of the targeting fragment as the dominant mechanism in wild-type cells. A small subset of transformants was consistent with assimilation of a single strand of targeting DNA encompassing both flanking homology regions and the marker into hDNA. hDNA formation during correction of a point mutation by targeted integration was conspicuously altered in a mismatch repair-deficient background and was consistent with single-strand invasion/assimilation without mismatch correction, confirming that gene targeting by this pathway is actively impeded in wild-type yeast. Finally, inversion of one targeted locus and mutation of an active origin of DNA replication at the other locus affected hDNA formation significantly, suggesting that formation of productive interactions between the targeting DNA and the targeted site in the chromosome is sensitive to local DNA dynamics.",

        "Title": "The Mre11 nuclease is not required for 5' to 3' resection at multiple HO-induced double-strand breaks.",
        "Abstract": "Current hypotheses suggest the Mre11 nuclease activity could be directly involved in double-strand break (DSB) resection in the presence of a large number of DSBs or limited to processing abnormal DNA ends. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used two methods to create large numbers of DSBs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes, without introducing other substrates for the Mre11 nuclease. Multiple DSBs were created either by expressing the HO endonuclease in strains containing several HO cut sites embedded within randomly dispersed Ty1 elements or by phleomycin treatment. Analysis of resection by single-strand DNA formation in these systems showed no difference between strains containing MRE11 or the mre11-D56N nuclease defective allele, suggesting that the Mre11 nuclease is not involved in the extensive 5' to 3' resection of DSBs. We postulate that the ionizing radiation (IR) sensitivity of mre11 nuclease-defective mutants results from the accumulation of IR-induced DNA damage that is normally processed by the Mre11 nuclease. We also report that the processivity of 5' to 3' DSB resection and the yield of repaired products are affected by the number of DSBs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, we show that the exonuclease Exo1 is involved in the processivity of 5' to 3' resection of an HO-induced DSB at the MAT locus.",

        "Abstract": "A chromosome fragmentation assay was used to measure the efficiency and genetic control of break-induced replication (BIR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Formation of a chromosome fragment by de novo telomere generation at one end of the linear vector and recombination-dependent replication of 100 kb of chromosomal sequences at the other end of the vector occurred at high frequency in wild-type strains. RAD51 was required for more than 95% of BIR events involving a single-end invasion and was essential when two BIR events were required for generation of a chromosome fragment. The similar genetic requirements for BIR and gene conversion suggest a common strand invasion intermediate in these two recombinational repair processes. Mutation of RAD50 or RAD59 conferred no significant defect in BIR in either RAD51 or rad51 strains. RAD52 was shown to be essential for BIR at unique chromosomal sequences, although rare recombination events were detected between the subtelomeric Y' repeats.",

Rad52 forms complexes with Rad51, replication protein A (RPA) or Rad59 and its presence is essential for the formation of Rad51-Rad52-Rad59 and RPA-Rad52-Rad59 complexes. The N-terminal region of Rad52, which is required for self-interaction to form a ring structure, is required for interaction with Rad59. Rad59 also shows self-interaction suggesting the formation of heteromeric and homomeric rings of Rad52 and Rad59. In wild-type cells, we propose the Rad51-Rad52-Rad59 complex is involved in conservative recombination events, including gene conversion and reciprocal recombination, whereas the Rad52-Rad59 complex participates in single-strand annealing.",

        "Abstract": "The process of homologous recombination is a major DNA repair pathway that operates on DNA double-strand breaks, and possibly other kinds of DNA lesions, to promote error-free repair. Central to the process of homologous recombination are the RAD52 group genes (RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RDH54/TID1, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, MRE11, and XRS2), most of which were identified by their requirement for the repair of ionizing-radiation-induced DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Rad52 group proteins are highly conserved among eukaryotes, and Rad51, Mre11, and Rad50 are also conserved in prokaryotes and archaea. Recent studies showing defects in homologous recombination and double-strand break repair in several human cancer-prone syndromes have emphasized the importance of this repair pathway in maintaining genome integrity. Although sensitivity to ionizing radiation is a universal feature of rad52 group mutants, the mutants show considerable heterogeneity in different assays for recombinational repair of double-strand breaks and spontaneous mitotic recombination. Herein, I provide an overview of recent biochemical and structural analyses of the Rad52 group proteins and discuss how this information can be incorporated into genetic studies of recombination.",

        "Abstract": "Rad51 can promote extensive strand exchange in vitro in the absence of ATP hydrolysis, and the Rad51-K191R mutant protein, which can bind but poorly hydrolyze ATP, also promotes strand exchange. A haploid strain expressing the rad51-K191R allele showed an equivalent sensitivity at low doses of ionizing radiation to rad51-K191A or rad51 null mutants and was defective in spontaneous and double-strand break-induced mitotic recombination. However, the rad51-K191R/rad51-K191R diploid sporulated and the haploid spores showed high viability, indicating no apparent defect in meiotic recombination. The DNA repair defect caused by the rad51-K191R allele was suppressed in diploids and by mating-type heterozygosity in haploids. RAD54 expressed from a high-copy-number plasmid also suppressed the gamma-ray sensitivity of rad51-K191R haploids. The suppression by mating-type heterozygosity of the DNA repair defect conferred by the rad51-K191R allele could occur by elevated expression of factors that act to stabilize, or promote catalysis, by the partially functional Rad51-K191R protein.",

A class of rad51 alleles was isolated that suppresses the requirement for RAD55 and RAD57 in DNA repair, but not the other accessory factors. Five of the six mutations isolated map to the region of Rad51 that by modeling with RecA corresponds to one of the DNA-binding sites. The other mutation is in the N-terminus of Rad51 in a domain implicated in protein-protein interactions and DNA binding. The Rad51-I345T mutant protein shows increased binding to single- and double-stranded DNA, and is proficient in displacement of replication protein A (RPA) from single-stranded DNA, suggesting that the normal function of Rad55-Rad57 is promotion and stabilization of Rad51-ssDNA complexes.",
