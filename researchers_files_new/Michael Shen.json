        "Abstract": "For many decades, the management of cancer has utilized radiation therapy, which continues to evolve with technology to improve patient outcomes. However, despite the standardization of treatment plans and the establishment of best clinical practices based on prospective, randomized trials and adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the outcomes from radiation therapy are highly variable and dependent on a number of factors, including patient demographics, tumor characteristics/histology, and treatment parameters. In this study, we attempt to use available patient data and treatment parameters at the time of radiation therapy to predict future outcomes using artificial intelligence (AI).",

In this work, we fabricated alginate-gelatin hydrogel beads for insulin encapsulation. Altering matrix composition and crosslinking agents has resulted in various surface morphologies and internal spatial organization. The structures of the insulin-loaded matrices were studied using optical and field emission electronic microscopy. We use FTIR spectroscopy to identify insulin conformation changes as affected by the hydrogel matrices. It was found that blended alginate-gelatin matrices demonstrate better encapsulation efficiency and stronger swelling resistance to a simulated gastric environment than sodium alginate beads crosslinked with the CaCl",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have facilitated studies of cell states and plasticity in tissue maintenance and cancer, including in the prostate. Here we present meta-analyses of multiple new and published scRNA-seq datasets to establish reference cell type classifications for the normal mouse and human prostate. Our analyses demonstrate transcriptomic similarities between epithelial cell states in the normal prostate, in the regressed prostate after androgen-deprivation, and in primary prostate tumors. During regression in the mouse prostate, all epithelial cells shift their expression profiles towards a proximal periurethral (PrU) state, demonstrating an androgen-dependent plasticity that is restored to normal during androgen restoration and regeneration. In the human prostate, we find progressive rewiring of transcriptional programs across epithelial cell types in benign prostate hyperplasia and treatment-naïve prostate cancer. Notably, we detect copy number variants predominantly within Luminal Acinar cells in prostate tumors, suggesting a bias in their cell type of origin, as well as a larger field of transcriptomic alterations in non-tumor cells. Finally, we observe that Luminal Acinar tumor cells in treatment-naïve prostate cancer display heterogeneous androgen receptor (AR) signaling activity, including a split between high-AR and low-AR profiles with similarity to PrU-like states. Taken together, our analyses of cellular heterogeneity and plasticity provide important translational insights into the origin and treatment response of prostate cancer.",

Several independent studies have described extensive heterogeneity of the luminal epithelial compartment, including a major division between a novel population of luminal cells located in the proximal region of the prostate ducts versus luminal cells located more distally. Proximal luminal cells as well as novel periurethral cells display increased progenitor potential in organoid culture and tissue reconstitution assays, but not in lineage-tracing analyses during prostate homeostasis, suggesting context-dependent plasticity of these populations. Here we describe and synthesize recent findings regarding the epithelial cell populations in the mouse prostate, draw comparisons to the human prostate, and address the relevance of these findings to prostate diseases and cancer.",

In principle, understanding the basis for prostate cancer heterogeneity can help distinguish aggressive from indolent disease, and help overcome castration-resistance in advanced prostate cancer. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in understanding the cell types of origin, putative cancer stem cells, and tumor plasticity in prostate cancer, focusing on insights from studies of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs).

        "Abstract": "Telomere length control is critical for cellular lifespan and tumor suppression. Telomerase is transiently activated in the inner cell mass of the developing blastocyst to reset telomere reserves. Its silencing upon differentiation leads to gradual telomere shortening in somatic cells. Here, we report that transcriptional regulation through cis-regulatory elements only partially accounts for telomerase activation in pluripotent cells. Instead, developmental control of telomerase is primarily driven by an alternative splicing event, centered around hTERT exon 2. Skipping of exon 2 triggers hTERT mRNA decay in differentiated cells, and conversely, its retention promotes telomerase accumulation in pluripotent cells. We identify SON as a regulator of exon 2 alternative splicing and report a patient carrying a SON mutation and suffering from insufficient telomerase and short telomeres. In summary, our study highlights a critical role for hTERT alternative splicing in the developmental regulation of telomerase and implicates defective splicing in telomere biology disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Androgen receptor (AR) plays a fundamental role in most aspects of adult prostate homeostasis, and anti-androgen therapy represents the cornerstone of prostate cancer treatment. However, early prostate organogenesis takes place during pre-pubertal stages when androgen levels are low, raising the possibility that AR function is more limited during prostate development. Here, we use inducible AR deletion and lineage tracing in genetically engineered mice to show that basal and luminal epithelial progenitors do not require cell-autonomous AR activity during prostate development. We also demonstrate the existence of a transient bipotent luminal progenitor that can generate luminal and basal progeny, yet is also independent of AR function. Furthermore, molecular analyses of AR-deleted luminal cells isolated from developing prostates indicate their similarity to wild-type cells. Our findings suggest that low androgen levels correlate with luminal plasticity in prostate development and may have implications for understanding how AR inhibition promotes lineage plasticity in prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the cellular constituents of the prostate is essential for identifying the cell of origin for prostate adenocarcinoma. Here, we describe a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the adult mouse prostate epithelium, which displays extensive heterogeneity. We observe distal lobe-specific luminal epithelial populations (LumA, LumD, LumL, and LumV), a proximally enriched luminal population (LumP) that is not lobe-specific, and a periurethral population (PrU) that shares both basal and luminal features. Functional analyses suggest that LumP and PrU cells have multipotent progenitor activity in organoid formation and tissue reconstitution assays. Furthermore, we show that mouse distal and proximal luminal cells are most similar to human acinar and ductal populations, that a PrU-like population is conserved between species, and that the mouse lateral prostate is most similar to the human peripheral zone. Our findings elucidate new prostate epithelial progenitors, and help resolve long-standing questions about anatomical relationships between the mouse and human prostate.",

        "Abstract": "Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a non-coding mutation in the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene that suppresses its expression. Compensatory hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and conduction system abnormalities in FRDA lead to cardiomyocyte (CM) death and fibrosis, consequently resulting in heart failure and arrhythmias. Murine models have been developed to study disease pathology in the past two decades; however, differences between human and mouse physiology and metabolism have limited the relevance of animal studies in cardiac disease conditions. To bridge this gap, we aimed to generate species-specific, functional in vitro experimental models of FRDA using 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) engineered cardiac tissues from FXN-deficient human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (hPSC-hvCMs) and to compare their contractile and electrophysiological properties with healthy tissue constructs.",

However, current methods can have limitations, including scale and restriction to high affinity interactions, limiting our understanding of a large subset of these interactions. Here, we describe a modified bacterial-hybrid assay that employs combined selectable and scalable reporters that enable the sensitive screening of large peptide libraries followed by the sorting of positive interactions by the level of reporter output. We have applied this tool to characterize a set of human and E. coli PDZ domains. Our results are consistent with prior characterization of these proteins, and the improved sensitivity increases our ability to predict known and novel in vivo binding partners. This approach allows for the recovery of a wide range of affinities with a high throughput method that does not sacrifice the scale of the screen.",

These changes present challenges to human adaptation and operation in space. This article reviews the knowledge gained in human experiments in the past half century of spaceflight, and summarizes our knowledge on the effects of short- and long-duration microgravity exposure on cardiovascular physiology and functioning, including fluid redistribution, autonomic reflexes, cardiac parameters, orthostatic intolerance, arrhythmias, aerobic capacity, and cardiac atrophy.

SCRaMbLE has been used to induce rearrangements in yeast strains harboring one or more synthetic chromosomes, as well as plasmid DNA in vitro and in vivo. Here we describe a collection of heterozygous diploid strains produced by mating haploid semisynthetic Sc2.0 strains to haploid native parental strains. We subsequently demonstrate that such heterozygous diploid strains are more robust to the effects of SCRaMbLE than haploid semisynthetic strains, rapidly improve rationally selected phenotypes in SCRaMbLEd heterozygous diploids, and establish that multiple sets of independent genomic rearrangements are able to lead to similar phenotype enhancements. Finally, we show that heterozygous diploid SCRaMbLE can also be carried out in interspecies hybrid strains.",

        "Abstract": "Historically, it has been widely presumed that differentiated cells are determined during development and become irreversibly committed to their designated fates. In certain circumstances, however, differentiated cells can display plasticity by changing their identity, either by dedifferentiation to a progenitor-like state or by transdifferentiation to an alternative differentiated cell type. Such cellular plasticity can be triggered by physiological or oncogenic stress, or it can be experimentally induced through cellular reprogramming. Notably, physiological stresses that promote plasticity, such as severe tissue damage, inflammation, or senescence, also represent hallmarks of cancer. Furthermore, key drivers of cellular plasticity include major oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways and can be exacerbated by drug treatment. Thus, plasticity may help cancer cells evade detection and treatment. We propose that cancer can be considered as a disease of excess plasticity, a notion that has important implications for intervention and treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Bladder cancer is the fifth most prevalent cancer in the U.S., yet is understudied, and few laboratory models exist that reflect the biology of the human disease. Here, we describe a biobank of patient-derived organoid lines that recapitulates the histopathological and molecular diversity of human bladder cancer. Organoid lines can be established efficiently from patient biopsies acquired before and after disease recurrence and are interconvertible with orthotopic xenografts. Notably, organoid lines often retain parental tumor heterogeneity and exhibit a spectrum of genomic changes that are consistent with tumor evolution in culture. Analyses of drug response using bladder tumor organoids show partial correlations with mutational profiles, as well as changes associated with treatment resistance, and specific responses can be validated using xenografts in vivo. Our studies indicate that patient-derived bladder tumor organoids represent a faithful model system for studying tumor evolution and treatment response in the context of precision cancer medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Master regulatory genes of tissue specification play key roles in stem/progenitor cells and are often important in cancer. In the prostate, androgen receptor (AR) is a master regulator essential for development and tumorigenesis, but its specific functions in prostate stem/progenitor cells have not been elucidated. We have investigated AR function in CARNs (CAstration-Resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells), a luminal stem/progenitor cell that functions in prostate regeneration. Using genetically--engineered mouse models and novel prostate epithelial cell lines, we find that progenitor properties of CARNs are largely unaffected by AR deletion, apart from decreased proliferation ",

        "Abstract": "To date, reprogramming strategies for generating cell types of interest have been facilitated by detailed understanding of relevant developmental regulatory factors. However, identification of such regulatory drivers often represents a major challenge, as specific gene combinations may be required for reprogramming. Here we show that a computational systems approach can identify cell type specification genes (master regulators) that act synergistically, and demonstrate its application for reprogramming of fibroblasts to prostate tissue. We use three such master regulators (FOXA1, NKX3.1 and androgen receptor, AR) in a primed conversion strategy starting from mouse fibroblasts, resulting in prostate tissue grafts with appropriate histological and molecular properties that respond to androgen-deprivation. Moreover, generation of reprogrammed prostate does not require traversal of a pluripotent state. Thus, we describe a general strategy by which cell types and tissues can be generated even with limited knowledge of the developmental pathways required for their specification in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Prostate organogenesis is a complex process that is primarily mediated by the presence of androgens and subsequent mesenchyme-epithelial interactions. The investigation of prostate development is partly driven by its potential relevance to prostate cancer, in particular the apparent re-awakening of key developmental programs that occur during tumorigenesis. However, our current knowledge of the mechanisms that drive prostate organogenesis is far from complete. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of prostate development, focusing on recent findings regarding sexual dimorphism, bud induction, branching morphogenesis and cellular differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Microglia are resident inflammatory cells of the CNS and have important roles in development, homeostasis and a variety of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Difficulties in procuring human microglia have limited their study and hampered the clinical translation of microglia-based treatments shown to be effective in animal disease models. Here we report the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) into microglia-like cells by exposure to defined factors and co-culture with astrocytes. These iPSC-derived microglia have the phenotype, gene expression profile and functional properties of brain-isolated microglia. Murine iPSC-derived microglia generated using a similar protocol have equivalent efficacy to primary brain-isolated microglia in treatment of murine syngeneic intracranial malignant gliomas. The ability to generate human microglia facilitates the further study of this important CNS cell type and raises the possibility of their use in personalized medicine applications.",

        "Abstract": "Nonshivering thermogenesis is the process of biological heat production in mammals and is primarily mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT). Through ubiquitous expression of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) on the mitochondrial inner membrane, BAT displays uncoupling of fuel combustion and ATP production in order to dissipate energy as heat. Because of its crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis, ongoing exploration of BAT has emphasized its therapeutic potential in addressing the global epidemics of obesity and diabetes. The recent appreciation that adult humans possess functional BAT strengthens this prospect. Furthermore, it has been identified that there are both classical brown adipocytes residing in dedicated BAT depots and \"beige\" adipocytes residing in white adipose tissue depots that can acquire BAT-like characteristics in response to environmental cues. This review aims to provide a brief overview of BAT research and summarize recent findings concerning the physiological, cellular, and developmental characteristics of brown adipocytes. In addition, some key genetic, molecular, and pharmacologic targets of BAT/Beige cells that have been reported to have therapeutic potential to combat obesity will be discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a versatile method for analyzing protein-protein interactions within living cells. This protocol describes a nondestructive live-cell FRET assay for robust quantification of relative binding affinities for protein-protein interactions. Unlike other approaches, our method correlates the measured FRET efficiencies to relative concentration of interacting proteins to determine binding isotherms while including collisional FRET corrections. We detail how to assemble and calibrate the equipment using experimental and theoretical procedures. A step-by-step protocol is given for sample preparation, data acquisition and analysis. The method uses relatively inexpensive and widely available equipment and can be performed with minimal training. Implementation of the imaging setup requires up to 1 week, and sample preparation takes ∼1-3 d. An individual FRET experiment, including control measurements, can be completed within 4-6 h, with data analysis requiring an additional 1-3 h.",

The prevalence and geographic distribution of PAH vary depending on the type and etiology of the disease. Despite enormous efforts in the research and development of therapeutic agents in the last twenty years, the disease remains relatively incurable and the overall prognosis remains guarded. Median survival for an untreated patient is 2.8 years. In the last three decades, there have been dramatic advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in the disease, resulting in emerging new treatment strategies. In the following pages, we will review currently approved treatments for PAH, as well as a new generation of investigational drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Contact with the extracellular matrix is essential for maintenance of epithelial cells in many tissues, while in its absence epithelial cells can detach and undergo anoikis. Here, we show that anoikis of luminal cells in the prostate epithelium is followed by a program of tissue repair that is mediated in part by differentiation of basal epithelial cells to luminal cells. We describe a mouse model in which inducible deletion of E-cadherin in prostate luminal cells results in their apoptotic cell death by anoikis, in the absence of phenotypic effects in the surrounding stroma. Quantitative assessments of proliferation and cell death in the luminal and basal compartments indicate that basal cells can rapidly generate luminal cells. Thus, our findings identify a role for basal-to-luminal differentiation in prostate epithelial repair, and provide a normal context to analogous processes that may occur during prostate cancer initiation.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity is a complex, multifactorial disease that has been extensively researched in recent times. Obesity is characterized by excess deposition of adipose tissue in response to surplus energy. Despite the negative connotations of adipose tissue (AT), it serves as a critical endocrine organ. Adipose tissue is a source of several adipokines and cytokines which have been deemed important for both normal metabolic function and disease formation. The discoveries of metabolically active brown AT in adult humans and adipose tissue derived stem cells (ADSC) have been key findings in the past decade with potential therapeutic implications. ADSCs represent an enticing pool of multipotent adult stem cells because of their noncontroversial nature, relative abundance, ease of isolation, and expandability. A decade and a half since the discovery of ADSCs, the scientific community is still working to uncover their therapeutic potential in a wide range of diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent developments in the field of ADSCs and examine their potential use in transplantation and cell-based therapies for the regeneration of diseased organs and systems. We also hope to provide perspective on how to best utilize this readily available, powerful pool of stem cells in the future.",

We describe how these results can be potentially reconciled by a conceptual distinction between cells of origin and cells of mutation, and outline how new experimental approaches can address the potential relationship between cell types of origin and disease outcome.",

In the case of prostate cancer, recent analyses of genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models have provided evidence supporting the existence of cancer stem cells in vivo. These studies suggest that cancer stem cells capable of tumor propagation exist at various stages of tumor progression from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to advanced metastatic and castration-resistant disease. However, studies of stem cells in prostate cancer have been limited by available approaches for evaluating their functional properties in cell culture and transplantation assays. Given the role of the tumor microenvironment and the putative cancer stem cell niche, future studies using GEM models to analyze cancer stem cells in their native tissue microenvironment are likely to be highly informative.",

More recent studies have applied bioinformatic approaches to generate regulatory network models of gene interactions on a genome-wide scale. Such models have provided insights into the gene networks regulating pluripotency in embryonic and epiblast stem cells, as well as cell-lineage determination in vivo. Here, we review how regulatory networks constructed for different stem cell types relate to corresponding networks in vivo and provide insights into understanding the molecular regulation of the blastocyst-gastrula transition.",

        "Abstract": "The intrinsic ability to exhibit self-organizing morphogenetic properties in ex vivo culture may represent a general property of tissue stem cells. Here we show that single luminal stem/progenitor cells can generate prostate organoids in a three-dimensional culture system in the absence of stroma. Organoids generated from CARNs (castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells) or normal prostate epithelia exhibit tissue architecture containing luminal and basal cells, undergo long-term expansion in culture and exhibit functional androgen receptor signalling. Lineage-tracing demonstrates that luminal cells are favoured for organoid formation and generate basal cells in culture. Furthermore, tumour organoids can initiate from CARNs after oncogenic transformation and from mouse models of prostate cancer, and can facilitate analyses of drug response. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the feasibility of organoid studies of human prostate tissue. Our studies underscore the progenitor properties of luminal cells, and identify in vitro approaches for studying prostate biology.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of cell types of origin for cancer has important implications for tumor stratification and personalized treatment. For prostate cancer, the cell of origin has been intensively studied, but it has remained unclear whether basal or luminal epithelial cells, or both, represent cells of origin under physiological conditions in vivo. Here, we use a novel lineage-tracing strategy to assess the cell of origin in a diverse range of mouse models, including Nkx3.1(+/-); Pten(+/-), Pten(+/-), Hi-Myc, and TRAMP mice, as well as a hormonal carcinogenesis model. Our results show that luminal cells are consistently the observed cell of origin for each model in situ; however, explanted basal cells from these mice can generate tumors in grafts. Consequently, we propose that luminal cells are favored as cells of origin in many contexts, whereas basal cells only give rise to tumors after differentiation into luminal cells.",

        "Abstract": "We report the case of a patient with a painful subcutaneous nodule, measuring 13 mm × 17 mm, at the pretibial graft aperture site, which presented two years after a successful anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with an autologous hamstring graft. A bioabsorbable poly-L-lactide interference screw was used for graft fixation at the tibial aperture. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion and curettage at the tunnel aperture. Grossly, extruded fragments of the screw and a thick pseudocapsule of surrounding tissue were excised. There was no communication between the tunnel aperture and the knee joint. The graft was also intact. Histological analysis revealed fragments of the bioabsorbable material in association with fibrous and granulomatous chronic inflammatory cells. This was consistent with a foreign body reaction. The patient subsequently recovered and resumed preinjury level of activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing a nodular granulomatous type reaction to foreign bioabsorbable poly-L-lactide screw material subsequent to an anterior cruciate reconstruction surgery.",

        "Title": "Rhabdomyolysis.",
        "Abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis is a well-known clinical syndrome of muscle injury associated with myoglobinuria, electrolyte abnormalities, and often acute kidney injury (AKI). The pathophysiology involves injury to the myocyte membrane and/or altered energy production that results in increased intracellular calcium concentrations and initiation of destructive processes. Myoglobin has been identified as the primary muscle constituent contributing to renal damage in rhabdomyolysis. Although rhabdomyolysis was first described with crush injuries and trauma, more common causes in hospitalized patients at present include prescription and over-the-counter medications, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The diagnosis is confirmed by elevated creatine kinase levels, but additional testing is needed to evaluate for potential causes, electrolyte abnormalities, and AKI. Treatment is aimed at discontinuation of further skeletal muscle damage, prevention of acute renal failure, and rapid identification of potentially life-threatening complications. Review of existing published data reveals a lack of high-quality evidence to support many interventions that are often recommended for treating rhabdomyolysis. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore renal perfusion and increase urine flow is agreed on as the main intervention for preventing and treating AKI. There is little evidence other than from animal studies, retrospective observational studies, and case series to support the routine use of bicarbonate-containing fluids, mannitol, and loop diuretics. Hyperkalemia and compartment syndrome are additional complications of rhabdomyolysis that must be treated effectively. A definite need exists for well-designed prospective studies to determine the optimal management of rhabdomyolysis.",

        "Abstract": "A key issue in cancer biology is whether oncogenic transformation of different cell types of origin within an adult tissue gives rise to distinct tumour subtypes that differ in their prognosis and/or treatment response. We now show that initiation of prostate tumours in basal or luminal epithelial cells in mouse models results in tumours with distinct molecular signatures that are predictive of human patient outcomes. Furthermore, our analysis of untransformed basal cells reveals an unexpected assay dependence of their stem cell properties in sphere formation and transplantation assays versus genetic lineage tracing during prostate regeneration and adult tissue homeostasis. Although oncogenic transformation of basal cells gives rise to tumours with luminal phenotypes, cross-species bioinformatic analyses indicate that tumours of luminal origin are more aggressive than tumours of basal origin, and identify a molecular signature associated with patient outcome. Our results reveal the inherent plasticity of basal cells, and support a model in which different cells of origin generate distinct molecular subtypes of prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "A set of vectors was constructed that enable combined and systematic testing of metabolic pathway genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The vectors are available as CEN/ARS and 2 µ-based plasmids with a choice of three inducible promoters, P(GAL1) , P(CUP1) and P(ADH2) . These features offer control over the initiation and level of gene expression. In addition, the vectors can be used as templates to generate PCR fragments for targeted chromosomal integration of gene expression cassettes. Selection markers are flanked by loxP elements to allow efficient CreA-mediated marker removal and recycling after genomic integration. For each promoter, expression of a bacterial lacZ reporter gene was characterized from plasmid-based and integrated chromosomal cassettes, and compared to that of the glycolytic P(PGK1) promoter. Plasmid stabilities were also determined. The promoters showed distinct activity profiles useful for modulating expression of metabolic pathway genes. This series of plasmids with inducible promoters extends our previous vector set carrying the constitutive promoters P(PGK1) , P(TEF1) and P(HXT7-391) .",

In particular, the cell of origin and cancer stem cell models have been proposed to explain the heterogeneity of tumors during the initiation, propagation, and evolution of cancer. Thus, a basis of intertumor heterogeneity has emerged from studies investigating whether stem cells and/or non-stem cells can serve as cells of origin for cancer and give rise to tumor subtypes that vary in disease outcome. Furthermore, analyses of putative cancer stem cells have revealed the genetically diverse nature of cancers and expanded our understanding of intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution. Overall, the principles that have emerged from these stem cell studies highlight the challenges to be surmounted to develop effective treatment strategies for cancer.",

        "Title": "Enhanced arsenate uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae overexpressing the Pho84 phosphate transporter.",
        "Abstract": "Arsenate is a major toxic constituent in arsenic-contaminated water supplies. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered as a potential biosorbent for enhanced arsenate accumulation. The phosphate transporter, Pho84p, known to import arsenate, was overexpressed using a 2μ-based vector carrying PHO84 under the control of the late-phase ADH2 promoter. Arsenate uptake was then evaluated using a resting cell system. In buffer solutions containing high arsenate concentrations (12,000 and 30,000 ppb), the engineered strains internalized up to 750 μg of arsenate per gram of cells, a 50% improvement over control strains. Increasing the cell mass 2.5-fold yielded a proportional increase in the volumetric arsenate uptake, while maintaining the same level of specific uptake. At high levels of arsenate, loss from the intact cells to the medium was observed with time; knockouts of two known arsenic extrusion genes, ACR3 and FPS1, did not prevent this loss. At trace level concentrations (120 ppb), rapid and total arsenate removal was observed. The presence of 50 μM phosphate reduced uptake by approximately 15% in buffer containing 80 μM (6,000 ppb) arsenate. At trace levels of arsenate (70 ppb), the phosphate reduced the initial rate of uptake, but not the total amount removed. PHO84 mRNA levels were nearly 30 times higher in the engineered strains relative to the control strains. Uptake may no longer be a limiting factor in the engineered system and further increases should be possible by upregulating the downstream reduction and sequestration pathways.",

        "Title": "Regulation of extra-embryonic endoderm stem cell differentiation by Nodal and Cripto signaling.",
        "Abstract": "The signaling pathway for Nodal, a ligand of the TGFβ superfamily, plays a central role in regulating the differentiation and/or maintenance of stem cell types that can be derived from the peri-implantation mouse embryo. Extra-embryonic endoderm stem (XEN) cells resemble the primitive endoderm of the blastocyst, which normally gives rise to the parietal and the visceral endoderm in vivo, but XEN cells do not contribute efficiently to the visceral endoderm in chimeric embryos. We have found that XEN cells treated with Nodal or Cripto (Tdgf1), an EGF-CFC co-receptor for Nodal, display upregulation of markers for visceral endoderm as well as anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), and can contribute to visceral endoderm and AVE in chimeric embryos. In culture, XEN cells do not express Cripto, but do express the related EGF-CFC co-receptor Cryptic (Cfc1), and require Cryptic for Nodal signaling. Notably, the response to Nodal is inhibited by the Alk4/Alk5/Alk7 inhibitor SB431542, but the response to Cripto is unaffected, suggesting that the activity of Cripto is at least partially independent of type I receptor kinase activity. Gene set enrichment analysis of genome-wide expression signatures generated from XEN cells under these treatment conditions confirmed the differing responses of Nodal- and Cripto-treated XEN cells to SB431542. Our findings define distinct pathways for Nodal and Cripto in the differentiation of visceral endoderm and AVE from XEN cells and provide new insights into the specification of these cell types in vivo.",

Recent evidence suggests that a minor subpopulation of cells with stem cell properties reside within these tumors. These tumor stem cells are more resistant to radiation and chemotherapies than their counterpart differentiated tumor cells and may underlie the persistence and recurrence of tumors following treatment. The various mechanisms by which tumor stem cells avoid or repair the damaging effects of cancer therapies are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "A set of shuttle vectors was constructed to facilitate expression of genes for metabolic engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Selectable markers include the URA3, TRP1, MET15, LEU2-d8, HIS3 and CAN1 genes. Differential expression of genes can be achieved as each marker is available on both CEN/ARS- and 2 µ-containing plasmids. Unique restriction sites downstream of TEF1, PGK1 or HXT7-391 promoters and upstream of the CYC1 terminator allow insertion of open-reading frame cassettes for expression. Furthermore, a fragment appropriate for integration into the genome via homologous recombination can be readily generated in a polymerase chain reaction. Vector marker genes are flanked by loxP recognition sites for the CreA recombinase to allow efficient site-specific marker deletion and recycling. Expression and copy number were characterized for representative high- and low-copy vectors carrying the different marker and promoter sequences. Metabolic engineering typically requires the stable introduction of multiple genes and genomic integration is often preferred. This requires an expanded number of stable expression sites relative to standard gene expression studies. This study demonstrated the practicality of polymerase chain reaction amplification of an expression cassette and genetic marker, and subsequent replacement of endogenous retrotransposons by homologous recombination with flanking sequences. Such reporters were expressed comparably to those inserted at standard integration loci. This expands the number of available characterized integration sites and demonstrates that such sites provide a virtually inexhaustible pool of integration targets for stable expression of multiple genes. Together these vectors and expression loci will facilitate combinatorial gene expression for metabolic engineering.",

Since early studies on the role of the androgen receptor that led to the advent of androgen deprivation therapy in the 1940s, there has long been intensive interest in the basic mechanisms underlying prostate cancer initiation and progression, as well as the potential to target these processes for therapeutic intervention. Here, we present an overview of major themes in prostate cancer research, focusing on current knowledge of principal events in cancer initiation and progression. We discuss recent advances, including new insights into the mechanisms of castration resistance, identification of stem cells and tumor-initiating cells, and development of mouse models for preclinical evaluation of novel therapuetics. Overall, we highlight the tremendous research progress made in recent years, and underscore the challenges that lie ahead.",

        "Abstract": "Arsenic contamination of ground water affects the health of millions of people worldwide. Bioremediation has the potential to lower contaminant levels in cases where physical methods are either ineffective or cost prohibitive. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered for enhanced arsenite accumulation by overexpression of transporters responsible for the influx of the contaminant. The transporter genes FPS1 and HXT7 were cloned under the control of the late-phase ADH2-promoter. This allowed for protein production at high biomass levels without the addition of inducer. Following the transfer of stationary phase cells to buffer, the engineered strains were capable of 3-4-fold greater arsenic uptake as compared to control cells. Further, at trace levels of the metalloid, the cells overexpressing the Fps1p transporter removed ca. 40% more arsenite from the extracellular medium than the controls. Arsenic uptake was also evaluated in cells overexpressing the transporters coupled with high-level production of cytosolic As sequestors (phytochelatins or bacterial ArsRp) to act as an intracellular sink. This led to an up to 4-fold increase in As accumulation in the resting cell culture as compared to native cells. The results demonstrate important steps needed to engineer a yeast biosorbent with enhanced accumulation capabilities for this metalloid.",

        "Abstract": "Prior epidemiologic studies have shown that increasing body mass index (BMI) is associated with higher total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL). However, these studies were limited by underrepresentation of obese subjects. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between BMI and lipid profiles in a population of patients with a broad spectrum of BMI values. A case-control study was performed involving patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic Florida. Cases (BMI >30 kg/m(2)) were obtained from the obesity surgery database between August 31, 2000, and April 4, 2002. Controls (BMI ≤ 30 kg/m(2)) were obtained from a database of primary care physicians between May 1, 2004, and November 18, 2004. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between BMI and lipid fractions. Multiple linear regression was performed to assess the independent effect of BMI on lipid levels while adjusting for potential confounders and propensity scores. Six hundred thirty-seven patients were analyzed (females, n = 362, 57%). There was no association between higher BMI and LDL (r = 0.19 p = 0.07), a negative association with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL; r = 0.45, p < 0.001), and a positive association with the log transformation of triglycerides (r = 0.32, p = 0.005).Higher BMI was inversely associated with HDL and directly associated with TG. BMI showed no significant association with LDL. Although the association between BMI and both HDL and TG may be explained by insulin resistance, the lack of a significant association between BMI and LDL remains an unexpected finding that requires further investigation.",

        "Abstract": "During early mouse embryogenesis, multiple patterning and differentiation events require the activity of Nodal, a ligand of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) family. Although Nodal signaling is known to require activity of EGF-CFC co-receptors in many contexts, it has been unclear whether all Nodal signaling in the early mouse embryo is EGF-CFC dependent. We have investigated the double null mutant phenotypes for the EGF-CFC genes Cripto and Cryptic, which encode co-receptors for Nodal, and have found that they have partially redundant functions in early mouse development. Expression of Cripto and Cryptic is non-overlapping prior to gastrulation, since Cripto is expressed solely in the epiblast whereas Cryptic is expressed in the primitive endoderm of the late blastocyst and the visceral endoderm after implantation. Despite these non-overlapping expression patterns, Cripto; Cryptic double mutants display severe defects in epiblast, extraembryonic ectoderm, and anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), resulting in phenotypes that are highly similar to those of Nodal null mutants. Our results indicate that both Cripto and Cryptic function non-cell-autonomously during normal development, and that most if not all Nodal activity in early mouse embryogenesis is EGF-CFC-dependent.",

        "Abstract": "In epithelial tissues, the lineage relationship between normal progenitor cells and cell type(s) of origin for cancer has been poorly understood. Here we show that a known regulator of prostate epithelial differentiation, the homeobox gene Nkx3-1, marks a stem cell population that functions during prostate regeneration. Genetic lineage-marking demonstrates that rare luminal cells that express Nkx3-1 in the absence of testicular androgens (castration-resistant Nkx3-1-expressing cells, CARNs) are bipotential and can self-renew in vivo, and single-cell transplantation assays show that CARNs can reconstitute prostate ducts in renal grafts. Functional assays of Nkx3-1 mutant mice in serial prostate regeneration suggest that Nkx3-1 is required for stem cell maintenance. Furthermore, targeted deletion of the Pten tumour suppressor gene in CARNs results in rapid carcinoma formation after androgen-mediated regeneration. These observations indicate that CARNs represent a new luminal stem cell population that is an efficient target for oncogenic transformation in prostate cancer.",

As a new method, however, differing clinical and reimbursement guidelines exist to guide the use of the method, resulting in confusion among referring and interpreting physicians in whether CCTA is reasonably indicated and covered by an individual patient's payer. Such confusion has slowed the acceptance of CCTA within the medical community. Clinical and reimbursement guidelines related to CCTA indications, including those from public and private payers, are reviewed, summarized, and compared in text and table formats. The commonalities extant within medical society guidelines and gradually within the payer community allow the increasingly frequent use of CCTA for certain indications. Challenges to full-fledged acceptance of the technique based on guideline and payer policies are reviewed and are increasingly being overcome.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies of epithelial cell growth and differentiation in the prostate gland have identified the homeodomain protein Nkx3.1 as a central regulator of prostate development and carcinogenesis. To understand the molecular mechanisms of Nkx3.1 function, we have used yeast two-hybrid analysis to identify Nkx3.1 interacting proteins, and have isolated Fem1b, a mammalian homolog of the C. elegans sex-determining gene Fem-1. In mice, the Fem1b and Nkx3.1 genes encode proteins that interact in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, and are co-expressed in the prostate and testis of neonatal mice. Null mutants for Fem1b generated by gene targeting display defects in prostate ductal morphogenesis and secretory protein expression, similar to phenotypes found in Nkx3.1 mutants. We propose that Fem1b may have a conserved role in the generation of sexual dimorphism through its interaction with Nkx3.1 in the developing prostate gland.",

        "Abstract": "Several tissue-specific regulatory genes have been found to play essential roles in both organogenesis and carcinogenesis. In the prostate, the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene plays an important role in normal differentiation of the prostatic epithelium while its loss of function is an initiating event in prostate carcinogenesis in both mouse models and human patients. Thus, the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene provides a paradigm for understanding the relationship between normal differentiation and cancer, as well as studying the roles of homeobox genes in these processes. Here, we review recent findings concerning the roles of Nkx3.1 in development and discuss how its normal function is disrupted in processes of early prostate carcinogenesis.",

        "Title": "Sox9 is required for prostate development.",
        "Abstract": "The mammalian prostate arises from the urogenital sinus and few factors have been identified to be important in the early stages of prostate development. In this study we show that the transcription factor Sox9 is expressed in the epithelia of all mouse prostatic lobes from the initial stages of their development. We used a conditional approach with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of Nkx3.1 regulatory sequences to delete Sox9 from the developing prostate. Mice with a prostate specific deletion of Sox9 showed a lack of ventral prostate development and abnormal anterior prostate differentiation. Analysis of these mutant animals revealed an early loss of expression of genes specific to the prostate epithelia such as Nkx3.1 and Shh and a marked reduction in proliferation in the ventral prostate but not in other lobes. Fgf signalling, through the MAPK pathway, has been shown to be important in prostate development and a lobe specific phenotype was reported for a prostate specific Fgfr2 mutant mouse model. Here we show that the levels of Fgfr2 and Sprouty2, a downstream target of Fgf signalling, were severely reduced in the ventral prostate of Sox9 mutant animals but not in other lobes. Prostate organ culture studies with a Mek inhibitor, U0126, and a Fgf receptor inhibitor, SU5402, indicate that the timing of expression of Cre in the mutant animals could account for the lobe specific phenotype in the Sox9 and Fgfr2 mutants. These studies imply that Sox9 is required for the early differentiation of the prostate bud epithelia.",

Two new studies in this issue of Cancer Cell underscore the importance of FGF signaling in mediating epithelial-stromal interactions during prostate carcinogenesis. These papers show that deregulated FGF signaling in mouse models of prostate cancer leads to cancer progression and promotes an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, suggesting that FGF receptor inhibitors may have therapeutic value for prostate cancer treatment.",

Analyses of mouse models have recently shown that the onset of hormone independence can be uncoupled from disease progression and is associated with activation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt as well as Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in the prostate epithelium, which act in part to counterbalance the inhibitory effects of androgen receptor signaling in the prostate stroma. These observations have potential implications for the treatment of patients with hormone refractory cancer and highlight the role of epithelial-stromal interactions for androgen independence.",

        "Title": "Conserved regulation and role of Pitx2 in situs-specific morphogenesis of visceral organs.",
        "Abstract": "Pitx2 is expressed in developing visceral organs on the left side and is implicated in left-right (LR) asymmetric organogenesis. The asymmetric expression of Pitx2 is controlled by an intronic enhancer (ASE) that contains multiple Foxh1-binding sites and an Nkx2-binding site. These binding sites are essential and sufficient for asymmetric enhancer activity and are evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates. We now show that mice that lack the ASE of Pitx2 (Pitx2(Delta)(ASE/)(Delta)(ASE) mice) fail to manifest left-sided Pitx2 expression and exhibit laterality defects in most visceral organs, although the position of the stomach and heart looping remain unaffected. Asymmetric Pitx2 expression in some domains, such as the common cardinal vein, was found to be induced by Nodal signaling but to be independent of the ASE of Pitx2. Expression of Pitx2 appears to be repressed in a large portion of the heart ventricle and atrioventricular canal of wild-type mice by a negative feedback mechanism at a time when the gene is still expressed in its other domains. Rescue of the early phase of asymmetric Pitx2 expression in the left lateral plate of Pitx2(Delta)(ASE/)(Delta)(ASE) embryos was not sufficient to restore normal organogenesis, suggesting that continuous expression of Pitx2 in the lineage of the left lateral plate is required for situs-specific organogenesis.",

        "Title": "Non-cell-autonomous role for Cripto in axial midline formation during vertebrate embryogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "Several membrane-associated proteins are known to modulate the activity and range of potent morphogenetic signals during development. In particular, members of the EGF-CFC family encode glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins that are essential for activity of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) ligand Nodal, a factor that plays a central role in establishing the vertebrate body plan. Genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that EGF-CFC proteins function as cell-autonomous co-receptors for Nodal; by contrast, cell culture data have suggested that the mammalian EGF-CFC protein Cripto can act as a secreted signaling factor. Here we show that Cripto acts non-cell-autonomously during axial mesendoderm formation in the mouse embryo and may possess intercellular signaling activity in vivo. Phenotypic analysis of hypomorphic mutants demonstrates that Cripto is essential for formation of the notochordal plate, prechordal mesoderm and foregut endoderm during gastrulation. Remarkably, Cripto null mutant cells readily contribute to these tissues in chimeras, indicating non-cell-autonomy. Consistent with these loss-of-function analyses, gain-of-function experiments in chick embryos show that exposure of node/head process mesoderm to soluble Cripto protein results in alterations in cell fates toward anterior mesendoderm, in a manner that is dependent on Nodal signaling. Taken together, our findings support a model in which Cripto can function in trans as an intercellular mediator of Nodal signaling activity.",

Our recent studies of a mouse model of prostate carcinogenesis have revealed that cancer progression is enhanced by a two-fold reduction in p27kip1 gene dosage, but is unexpectedly inhibited by further decrease in p27kip1 activity. This paradoxical finding may explain the unusual features of p27kip1 downregulation in human cancer, and also suggests a potential route for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Abstract": "During vertebrate embryogenesis, members of the Lefty subclass of Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGFbeta) proteins act as extracellular antagonists of the signaling pathway for Nodal, a TGFbeta-related ligand essential for mesendoderm formation and left-right patterning. Genetic and biochemical analyses have shown that Nodal signaling is mediated by activin receptors but also requires EGF-CFC coreceptors, such as mammalian Cripto or Cryptic. Misexpression experiments in zebrafish and frogs have suggested that Lefty proteins can act as long-range inhibitors for Nodal, possibly through competition for binding to activin receptors. Here we demonstrate two distinct and unexpected mechanisms by which Lefty proteins can antagonize Nodal activity. In particular, using a novel assay for Lefty activity in mammalian cell culture, we find that Lefty can inhibit signaling by Nodal but not by Activin or TGFbeta1, which are EGF-CFC independent. We show that Lefty can interact with Nodal in solution and thereby block Nodal from binding to activin receptors. Furthermore, Lefty can also interact with EGF-CFC proteins and prevent their ability to form part of a Nodal receptor complex. Our results provide mechanistic insights into how Lefty proteins can achieve efficient and stringent regulation of a potent signaling factor.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a critical role in the development and patterning of many endodermally derived tissues. We have investigated the role of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in formation of the prostate gland by examining the urogenital phenotype of Shh mutant fetuses. Consistent with earlier work reporting an essential role for Shh in prostate induction, we have found that Shh mutant fetuses display abnormal urogenital development and fail to form prostate buds. Unexpectedly, however, we have discovered that this prostate defect could be rescued by three different methods: renal grafting, explant culture in the presence of androgens, and administration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to pregnant mice, indicating that the prostate defect in Shh mutants is due to insufficient levels of androgens. Furthermore, we find that the inhibition of Hh pathway signaling by treatment with cyclopamine does not block prostate formation in explant culture, but instead produces morphological defects consistent with a role for Hh signaling in ductal patterning. Taken together, our studies indicate that the initial organogenesis of the prostate proceeds independently of Shh, but that Shh or other Hh ligands may play a role in subsequent events that pattern the prostate.",

        "Abstract": "Although it is often presumed that the molecular pathways that underlie normal organogenesis are similar to those perturbed during carcinogenesis, few examples exist of tissue-specific regulatory genes that play central roles in both processes. In the case of the prostate gland, molecular genetic analyses have demonstrated that the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene plays an important role in normal differentiation of the prostatic epithelium and that its loss of function is an initiating event in prostate carcinogenesis. Thus, the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene provides a paradigm for understanding the relationship between normal differentiation and cancer, as well as a model for studying the roles of homeobox genes in these processes. Here, we review recent findings concerning the biological as well as biochemical function of this central regulator of prostate development and carcinogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "To begin to reconcile models of floor plate formation in the vertebrate neural tube, we have performed experiments aimed at understanding the development of the early floor plate in the chick embryo. Using real-time analyses of cell behaviour, we provide evidence that the principal contributor to the early neural midline, the future anterior floor plate, exists as a separate population of floor plate precursor cells in the epiblast of the gastrula stage embryo, and does not share a lineage with axial mesoderm. Analysis of the tissue interactions associated with differentiation of these cells to a floor plate fate reveals a role for the nascent prechordal mesoderm, indicating that more than one inductive event is associated with floor plate formation along the length of the neuraxis. We show that Nr1, a chick nodal homologue, is expressed in the nascent prechordal mesoderm and we provide evidence that Nodal signalling can cooperate with Shh to induce the epiblast precursors to a floor-plate fate. These results indicate that a shared lineage with axial mesoderm cells is not a pre-requisite for floor plate differentiation and suggest parallels between the development of the floor plate in amniote and anamniote embryos.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have shown that several loss-of-function mouse models of prostate carcinogenesis can develop a spectrum of precancerous lesions that resemble human prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Here, we have investigated the malignant potential of the high-grade PIN lesions that form in Nkx3.1(+/-); Pten(+/-) compound mutant mice and demonstrate their neoplastic progression in a serial transplantation/tissue recombination assay. Furthermore, we find that a majority of Nkx3.1(+/-); Pten(+/-) mice greater than 1 year of age develop invasive adenocarcinoma, which is frequently accompanied by metastases to lymph nodes. Finally, we observe androgen independence of high-grade PIN lesions after androgen ablation of Nkx3.1(+/-); Pten(+/-) mice. We conclude that Nkx3.1(+/-); Pten(+/-) mice recapitulate key features of advanced prostate cancer and represent a useful model for investigating associated molecular mechanisms and for evaluating therapeutic approaches.",

Here we show that the transcriptional corepressor DRAP1 has a very specific role in regulation of Nodal activity during mouse embryogenesis. We find that loss of Drap1 leads to severe gastrulation defects that are consistent with increased expression of Nodal and can be partially suppressed by Nodal heterozygosity. Biochemical studies indicate that DRAP1 interacts with and inhibits DNA binding by the winged-helix transcription factor FoxH1 (FAST), a critical component of a positive feedback loop for Nodal activity. We propose that DRAP1 limits the spread of a morphogenetic signal by down-modulating the response to the Nodal autoregulatory loop.",

        "Abstract": "The EGF-CFC gene Cripto encodes an extracellular protein that has been implicated in the signaling pathway for the transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) ligand Nodal. Although recent findings in frog and fish embryos have suggested that EGF-CFC proteins function as coreceptors for Nodal, studies in cell culture have implicated Cripto as a growth factor-like signaling molecule. Here we reconcile these apparently disparate models of Cripto function by using a mammalian cell culture assay to investigate the signaling activities of Nodal and EGF-CFC proteins. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we found that Cripto has activities consistent with its being a coreceptor for Nodal. However, Cripto can also function as a secreted signaling factor in cell coculture assays, suggesting that it may also act as a coligand for Nodal. Furthermore, we found that the ability of Cripto to bind to Nodal and mediate Nodal signaling requires the addition of an O-linked fucose monosaccharide to a conserved site within EGF-CFC proteins. We propose a model in which Cripto has dual roles as a coreceptor as well as a coligand for Nodal and that this signaling interaction with Nodal is regulated by an unusual form of glycosylation. Our findings highlight the significance of extracellular modulation of ligand activity as an important means of regulating TGF beta signaling pathways during vertebrate development.",
