        "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to report outcomes of dogs undergoing cholecystectomy for gall bladder mucocele (GBM) without flushing and catheterization of the common bile duct (CBD). This is a retrospective multicentric study from three veterinary referral hospitals and included 82 dogs diagnosed with GBM. Medical records were reviewed for clinical and histopathological findings. Long-term outcome was assessed with an owner questionnaire. The common bile duct was considered normal (<4 mm), mildly dilated (5−6 mm) and moderately dilated (>7 mm) in 88%, 10% and 2.4% of dogs, respectively. Surgery was uncomplicated in 83% of dogs. Intraoperative complications were recorded in 21% of dogs, with hypotension being the most common, whereas postoperative complications were documented in 20% of dogs, with vomiting/regurgitation being the most common. Ninety-six percent of dogs that underwent cholecystectomy in this study survived to discharge. Follow-up ranged from 142 to 3930 days (median: 549 days). Eighty-five percent of dogs were alive at the time of follow-up. Dogs undergoing cholecystectomy for GBM without catheterization and flushing of the CBD have a favourable prognosis for recovery and quality of life.",

        "Abstract": "Inherited prion diseases are caused by autosomal dominant coding mutations in the human prion protein (PrP) gene (PRNP) and account for about 15% of human prion disease cases worldwide. The proposed mechanism is that the mutation predisposes to conformational change in the expressed protein, leading to the generation of disease-related multichain PrP assemblies that propagate by seeded protein misfolding. Despite considerable experimental support for this hypothesis, to-date spontaneous formation of disease-relevant, transmissible PrP assemblies in transgenic models expressing only mutant human PrP has not been demonstrated. Here, we report findings from transgenic mice that express human PrP 117V on a mouse PrP null background (117VV Tg30 mice), which model the PRNP A117V mutation causing inherited prion disease (IPD) including Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease phenotypes in humans. By studying brain samples from uninoculated groups of mice, we discovered that some mice (≥475 days old) spontaneously generated abnormal PrP assemblies, which after inoculation into further groups of 117VV Tg30 mice, produced a molecular and neuropathological phenotype congruent with that seen after transmission of brain isolates from IPD A117V patients to the same mice. To the best of our knowledge, the 117VV Tg30 mouse line is the first transgenic model expressing only mutant human PrP to show spontaneous generation of transmissible PrP assemblies that directly mirror those generated in an inherited prion disease in humans.",

        "Title": "The role of Sevenless in Drosophila R7 photoreceptor specification.",
        "Abstract": "Sevenless (Sev) is a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) that is required for the specification of the Drosophila R7 photoreceptor. Other Drosophila photoreceptors are specified by the action of another RTK; the Drosophila EGF Receptor (DER). Why Sev is required specifically in the R7 precursor, and the exact role it plays in the cell's fate assignment have long remained unclear. Notch (N) signaling plays many roles in R7 specification, one of which is to prevent DER activity from establishing the photoreceptor fate. Our current model of Sev function is that it hyperactivates the RTK pathway in the R7 precursor to overcome the N-imposed block on photoreceptor specification. From this perspective DER and Sev are viewed as engaging the same transduction machinery, the only difference between them being the level of pathway activation that they induce. To test this model, we generated a Sev/DER chimera in which the intracellular domain of Sev is replaced with that of DER. This chimerical receptor acts indistinguishably from Sev itself; a result that is entirely consistent with the two RTKs sharing identical transduction abilities. A long-standing question in regard to Sev is the function of a hydrophobic domain some 60 amino acids from the initiating Methionine. If this represents a transmembrane domain, it would endow Sev with N-terminal intracellular sequences through which it could engage internal transduction pathways. However, we find that this domain acts as an internal signal peptide, and that there is no Sev N-terminal intracellular domain. phyllopod (phyl) is the target gene of the RTK pathway, and we show that R7 precursors are selectively lost when phyl gene function is mildly compromised, and that other photoreceptors are removed when the gene function is further reduced. This result adds a key piece of evidence for the hyperactivation of the RTK pathway in the R7 precursor. To facilitate the hyperactivation of the RTK pathway, Sev is expressed at high levels. However, when we express DER at the levels at which Sev is expressed, strong gain-of-function effects result, consistent with ligand-independent activation of the receptor. This highlights another key feature of Sev; that it is expressed at high levels yet remains strictly ligand dependent. Finally, we find that activated Sev can rescue R3/4 photoreceptors when their DER function is abrogated. These results are collectively consistent with Sev and DER activating the same transduction machinery, with Sev generating a pathway hyperactivation to overcome the N-imposed block to photoreceptor specification in R7 precursors.",

        "Abstract": "In Planar cell polarity (PCP), cells coordinately polarize their cytoskeletons within the plane of the epithelium in which they lie. In most insect epithelia this is indicated by the coordinated projections of the hairs secreted by the ectodermal cells. PCP of this form has been effectively studied in Drosophila, but it has proven difficult to achieve an integrated description of the roles played by the various proteins. In the insect eye, PCP is not evident as the polarization of individual cells, but as the asymmetric arrangements of the cells of the ommatidia. This different form of PCP allows different studies to be performed, and using this system we have detected the action of two antagonistic signaling pathways. Even though antagonistic, the two pathways synergize and cooperate to ensure that the correct arrangement of the cells is achieved. The cooperative use of antagonistic signaling pathways occurs in the polarization of chemotacting cells, and we discuss the possibility that a similar molecular principle may underlie PCP.",

        "Abstract": "The specification of the R7 photoreceptor in the Drosophila eye has become a classic model for understanding how cell fates are assigned in developing systems. R7 is derived from a group of cells that also gives rise to the R1/6 photoreceptor class and the non-photoreceptor cone cells. Our studies examine the signals and cellular information that direct each of these cell types. The cell fates are directed by the combined actions of the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) and Notch (N) signaling pathways. The RTK pathway acts to remove the transcription factor Tramtrack (Ttk) which represses the photoreceptor fate. If a cell receives an RTK signal sufficient to remove Ttk then the photoreceptor fate is specified; if not, the cone cell fate results. If Ttk is removed from a cell and its N activity is high then it is specified as an R7, but if its N activity is low then it becomes an R1/6 class photoreceptor. Thus, a remarkably simple molecular code underlies the specification of the fates: 1. Ttk degraded or not: 2. N activity high or low. In the R1/6 and cone cell precursors the molecular codes are achieved with relative simplicity but in the R7 precursor, manifold interactions occur between the RTK and N pathways, and to-date we have identified 4 distinct roles played by N in R7 fate specification. In this review we detail this molecular complexity, and describe how the RTK/N pathway crosstalk eventually leads to the simple molecular code of Tramtrack removed and N activity high. Furthermore, we describe the role played by the transcription factor Lozenge (Lz) in directing retinal precursor fates, and how the RTK/N signals specify different retinal cell types depending on the presence or absence of Lz.",

        "Title": "R7 Photoreceptor Specification in the Developing Drosophila Eye: The Role of the Transcription Factor Deadpan.",
        "Abstract": "As cells proceed along their developmental pathways they make a series of sequential cell fate decisions. Each of those decisions needs to be made in a robust manner so there is no ambiguity in the state of the cell as it proceeds to the next stage. Here we examine the decision made by the Drosophila R7 precursor cell to become a photoreceptor and ask how the robustness of that decision is achieved. The transcription factor Tramtrack (Ttk) inhibits photoreceptor assignment, and previous studies found that the RTK-induced degradation of Ttk was critically required for R7 specification. Here we find that the transcription factor Deadpan (Dpn) is also required; it is needed to silence ttk transcription, and only when Ttk protein degradation and transcriptional silencing occur together is the photoreceptor fate robustly achieved. Dpn expression needs to be tightly restricted to R7 precursors, and we describe the role played by Ttk in repressing dpn transcription. Thus, Dpn and Ttk act as mutually repressive transcription factors, with Dpn acting to ensure that Ttk is effectively removed from R7, and Ttk acting to prevent Dpn expression in other cells. Furthermore, we find that N activity is required to promote dpn transcription, and only in R7 precursors does the removal of Ttk coincide with high N activity, and only in this cell does Dpn expression result.",

        "Abstract": "Morphogen gradients play pervasive roles in development, and understanding how they are established and decoded is a major goal of contemporary developmental biology. Here we examine how a Wingless (Wg) morphogen gradient patterns the peripheral specialization of the fly eye. The outermost specialization is the pigment rim; a thick band of pigment cells that circumscribes the eye and optically insulates the sides of the retina. It results from the coalescence of pigment cells that survive the death of the outermost row of developing ommatidia. We investigate here how the Wg target genes expressed in the moribund ommatidia direct the intercellular signaling, the morphogenetic movements, and ultimately the ommatidial death. A salient feature of this process is the secondary expression of the Wg morphogen elicited in the ommatidia by the primary Wg signal. We find that neither the primary nor secondary sources of Wg alone are able to promote ommatidial death, but together they suffice to drive the apoptosis. This represents an unusual gradient read-out process in which a morphogen induces its own expression in its target cells to generate a concentration spike required to push the local cellular responses to the next threshold response.",

        "Abstract": "The developing Drosophila ommatidium is characterized by two distinct waves of pattern formation. In the first wave, a precluster of five cells is formed by a complex cellular interaction mechanism. In the second wave, cells are systematically recruited to the cluster and directed to their fates by developmental cues presented by differentiating precluster cells. These developmental cues are mediated through the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and Notch (N) signaling pathways and their combined activities are crucial in specifying cell type. The transcription factor Lozenge (Lz) is expressed exclusively in second wave cells. Here, we ectopically supply Lz to precluster cells and concomitantly supply the various RTK/N codes that specify each of three second wave cell fates. We thereby reproduce molecular markers of each of the second wave cell types in precluster cells and draw three inferences. First, we confirm that Lz provides key intrinsic information to second wave cells. We can now combine this with the RTK/N signaling to provide a cell fate specification code that entails both extrinsic and intrinsic information. Second, the reproduction of each second wave cell type in the precluster confirms the accuracy of the RTK/N signaling code. Third, RTK/N signaling and Lz need only be presented to the cells for a short period of time in order to specify their fate.",

        "Abstract": "The Drosophila R7 photoreceptor precursor is directed to its fate by signals from adjacent cells that activate its Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) and Notch (N) signaling pathways. Counter-intuitively, the N activity both promotes and inhibits the photoreceptor fate in the R7 precursor. We offer an evolutionary perspective for this in which earlier ommatidia had fewer photoreceptors and used N to inhibit the addition of any more. When additional photoreceptors were added by evolution, an RTK signal was used to overcome the N inhibition in these cells, and these new additions potently activated N in their neighboring cells, preventing them from also responding to the RTK signal. The R7 precursor also receives this block, and requires robust RTK activation for it to become a photoreceptor. This is achieved by N transcriptionally activating a new RTK, one that is potently activated in the R7 precursor and sufficing to overcome the N inhibition. The unusually high RTK signal in R7 requires additional transduction components not needed when the signal is mild; in R7 the small GTPases Ras and Rap are both required to transduce the signal, but in other photoreceptors Ras alone suffices.",

Screening pigments expressed by a number of cell types contribute to this phenomenon. They provide optical insulation that prevents extraneous light rays from inappropriately activating the photoreceptors. This optical insulation can be divided into two categories; the insulation of the individual ommatidia, and the insulation of the compound eye as a whole. The whole-eye insulation is provided by two sources. The sides of the eye are optically insulated by the pigment rim, a band of pigment cells that circumscribes the eye. The base of the eye is insulated by the subretinal pigment layer; a thick layer of pigment that lies directly underneath the retina. How this subretinal pigment layer is generated has not been clearly described. Here, experiments that manipulate pigment expression during eye development suggest that the subretinal pigment layer is directly derived from pigment cells in the overlying retina.",

        "Abstract": "The Drosophila R7 photoreceptor provides an excellent model system with which to study how cells receive and \"decode\" signals that specify cell fate. R7 is specified by the combined actions of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and Notch (N) signaling pathways. These pathways interact in a complex manner that includes antagonistic effects on photoreceptor specification: RTK promotes the photoreceptor fate, whereas N inhibits. Although other photoreceptors are subject to only mild N activation, R7 experiences a high-level N signal. To counter this effect and to ensure that the cell is specified as a photoreceptor, a high RTK signal is transduced in the cell. Thus, there are two levels of RTK transduction in the photoreceptors: in R7 it is high, whereas in others it is low. Here, we address how this high-level RTK signal is transduced in R7 and find that, in addition to Ras, another small GTPase, Rap, is also engaged. Thus, when N activity is high, a robust RTK signal operates that uses both Ras and Rap, but when N activity is low, only a mild RTK signal is transduced and Ras alone suffices for the purpose.",

        "Abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and Notch (N) proteins are different types of transmembrane receptors that transduce extracellular signals and control cell fate. Here we examine cell fate specification in the Drosophila retina and ask how N acts together with the RTKs Sevenless (Sev) and the EGF receptor (DER) to specify the R7 photoreceptor. The retina is composed of many hundred ommatidia, each of which grows by recruiting surrounding, undifferentiated cells and directing them to particular fates. The R7 photoreceptor derives from a cohort of three cells that are incorporated together following specification of the R2-R5 and R8 photoreceptors. Two cells of the cohort are specified as the R1/6 photoreceptor type by DER activation. These cells then activate N in the third cell (the R7 precursor). By manipulation of N and RTK signaling in diverse combinations we establish three roles for N in specifying the R7 fate. The first role is to impose a block to photoreceptor differentiation; a block that DER activation cannot overcome. The second role, paradoxically, is to negate the first; Notch activation up-regulates Sev expression, enabling the presumptive R7 cell to receive an RTK signal from R8 that can override the block. The third role is to specify the cell as an R7 rather than an R1/6 once RTK signaling has specified the cells as a photoreceptor. We speculate why N acts both to block and to facilitate photoreceptor differentiation, and provide a model for how N and RTK signaling act combinatorially to specify the R1/6 and R7 photoreceptors as well as the surrounding non-neuronal cone cells.",

        "Abstract": "The fatal adult motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) shares some clinical and pathological overlap with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder. The RNA/DNA-binding proteins fused in sarcoma (FUS; also known as TLS) and TAR DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) have recently been shown to be genetically and pathologically associated with familial forms of ALS and FTD. It is currently unknown whether perturbation of these proteins results in disease through mechanisms that are independent of normal protein function or via the pathophysiological disruption of molecular processes in which they are both critical. Here, we report that Drosophila mutants in which the homolog of FUS is disrupted exhibit decreased adult viability, diminished locomotor speed, and reduced life span compared with controls. These phenotypes were fully rescued by wild-type human FUS, but not ALS-associated mutant FUS proteins. A mutant of the Drosophila homolog of TDP-43 had similar, but more severe, deficits. Through cross-rescue analysis, we demonstrated that FUS acted together with and downstream of TDP-43 in a common genetic pathway in neurons. Furthermore, we found that these proteins associated with each other in an RNA-dependent complex. Our results establish that FUS and TDP-43 function together in vivo and suggest that molecular pathways requiring the combined activities of both of these proteins may be disrupted in ALS and FTD.",

        "Abstract": "Boundaries between different cell types play key roles in many developmental patterning processes. They can be established by various mechanisms, and signaling between the different cell types can occur in a number of ways. One mechanism of crossboundary signaling is controlled by the Notch (N)-modifying protein Fringe (Fng). At the Drosophila wing dorsal-ventral (D-V) border, the mechanism by which an Fng(+)-Fng(-) interface controls local N activation has been well characterized. A similar N-activating Fng(+)-Fng(-) interface has also been described at the D-V border of the fly eye, but the mechanisms that establish and regulate it are different from those in the wing. Here we describe the ventral role of the Sloppy-paired (Slp) transcription factor, and its interactions with dorsally expressed Iroquois (Iro) transcription factors in the regulation of signaling about the Fng(+)-Fng(-) interface in the developing eye. The two transcription factors are mutually repressive and initially abut at the D-V midline. However, N signaling at the interface downregulates Slp expression, and a gap opens between the two expression domains in which Serrate (Ser, an N ligand) is upregulated.",

        "Abstract": "Polarization of the cellular cytoskeleton underlies many cellular processes including axon growth cone guidance, chemotaxis and yeast mating. Planar cell polarity (PCP) is a similar phenomenon in which cells in an epithelium become uniformly polarized to generate a field of aligned structures such as the hair cells of the cochlea. In Drosophila PCP is under the hierarchical control of Frizzled (Fz)-a serpentine receptor (that also functions in the Wnt signaling pathway). Serpentine receptors are routinely transduced by trimeric G-proteins, but until recently the general consensus was that Fzs were not G-protein linked. In Drosophila a G-protein (Galpha(o)) has now been identified that functions in both the Wnt and PCP pathways. Here we review the cell polarity phenotypes of Galpha(o) mutants and discuss the evidence that it plays multifarious roles in PCP and the organization of the cytoskeleton.",

        "Abstract": "The periphery of the fly eye contains a number of concentrically arranged cellular specializations that are induced by Wingless (Wg) signaling from the surrounding head capsule (HC). One of these is the pigment rim (PR), which is a thick layer of pigment cells that lies directly adjacent to the HC and completely circumscribes the rest of the retina. Many of the cells of the PR are derived from presumptive pigment cells that previously surrounded peripheral ommatidia that subsequently died. Here, we describe the Wg-elicited expression of Snail family transcription factors in the eye periphery that directs the ommatidial death and subsequent PR formation. These transcription factors are expressed only in a subset of the ommatidial cells not including the photoreceptors. Yet, the photoreceptors die and, thus, a non-autonomous death signal is released from the Snail-family-expressing cells that direct the death of the photoreceptors. In addition, Wg also elicits a similar peripheral expression of Notum, an enzyme that limits the extent of Wg signaling. Furthermore, we describe a later requirement for Snail family proteins in the 2 degrees and 3 degrees pigment cells throughout the main body of the eye.",

        "Abstract": "During asymmetric division, a cell polarizes and differentially distributes components to its opposite ends. The subsequent division differentially segregates the two component pools to the daughters, which thereby inherit different developmental directives. In Drosophila sensory organ precursor cells, the localization of Numb protein to the cell's anterior cortex is a key patterning event and is achieved by the combined action of many proteins, including Pins, which itself is localized anteriorly. Here, a role is described for the trimeric G protein Go in the anterior localization of Numb and daughter cell fate specification. Go is shown to interact with Pins. In addition to a role in recruiting Numb to an asymmetric location in the cell's cortex, Go transduces a signal from the Frizzled receptor that directs the position in which the complex forms. Thus, Go likely integrates the signaling that directs the formation of the complex with the signaling that directs where the complex forms.",

        "Abstract": "Planar cell polarity (PCP) is a level of tissue organization in which cells adopt a uniform orientation within the plane of an epithelium. The process of tissue polarization is likely to be initiated by an extracellular gradient. Thus, determining how cells decode and convert this graded information into subcellular asymmetries is key to determining how cells direct the reorganization of the cytoskeleton to produce uniformly oriented structures. Twinstar (Tsr), the Drosophila homolog of Cofilin/ADF (actin depolymerization factor), is a component of the cytoskeleton that regulates actin dynamics. We show here that various alleles of tsr produce PCP defects in the wing, eye and several other epithelia. In wings mutant for tsr, Frizzled (Fz) and Flamingo (Fmi) proteins do not properly localize to the proximodistal boundaries of cells. The correct asymmetric localization of these proteins instructs the actin cytoskeleton to produce one actin-rich wing hair at the distal-most vertex of each cell. These results argue that actin remodeling is not only required in the manufacture of wing hairs, but also in the PCP read-out that directs where a wing hair will be secreted.",

Serpentine receptors usually signal to downstream effectors through an associated trimeric G protein complex. However, clear evidence for the role of trimeric G protein complexes for the Fz family of receptors has hitherto been lacking. Here, we show roles for the Galpha(o) subunit (Go) in mediating the two distinct pathways transduced by Fz receptors in Drosophila: the Wnt and planar polarity pathways. Go is required for transduction of both pathways, and epistasis experiments suggest that it is an immediate transducer of Fz. While overexpression effects of the wild-type form are receptor dependent, the activated form (Go-GTP) can signal when the receptor is removed. Thus, Go is likely part of a trimeric G protein complex that directly transduces Fz signals from the membrane to downstream components.",

        "Title": "Drosophila Smoothened phosphorylation sites essential for Hedgehog signal transduction.",
        "Abstract": "The Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway is crucial for animal development and is aberrantly activated in several types of cancer. In Drosophila melanogaster, Hh signalling regulates target gene expression through the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci). Together, Protein Kinase A, Casein Kinase 1 and Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 silence the pathway in the absence of ligand by phosphorylating Ci at a defined cluster of sites, thereby promoting its proteolytic conversion to a transcriptional repressor (Ci-75). In the presence of Hh, Ci-155 is no longer converted to Ci-75 and its ability to activate transcription is potentiated. All Hh responses require the seven transmembrane domain protein Smoothened, which itself becomes hyperphosphorylated during Hh signalling. Here we show that a cluster of protein kinase A and protein kinase A-primed casein kinase 1 phosphorylation sites in Smoothened, similarly distributed to those regulating Ci, are essential for Smoothened to transduce a Hh signal and for normal regulation of Smoothened protein levels.",

        "Title": "Evidence that the cysteine-rich domain of Drosophila Frizzled family receptors is dispensable for transducing Wingless.",
        "Abstract": "Members of the Frizzled family of serpentine transmembrane receptors are required to transduce Wingless/Int (Wnt) signals and contain in their N-terminal regions a conserved Wnt-binding cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Each CRD has specific affinities for particular Wnts, and it is generally believed that signal transduction depends on the strength of this interaction. Here, we report in vivo evidence that the CRD is dispensable for Frizzled family receptors to transduce Wingless (Wg), the primary Wnt signal in Drosophila. Thus, we infer that signal transduction does not require binding of Wg to the CRD, but instead depends on interactions between Wg and other portions of the receptor, or other proteins of the receptor complex.",

        "Abstract": "The peripheral regions of the fly eye show a number of specializations. First, immediately interior to the circumscribing head capsule and completely encircling the rest of the eye lies a thick band of pigment cells (pigment rim; PR). Second, in the dorsal periphery of the eye directly interior to the PR lie the dorsal rim (DR) ommatidia that are specialized polarized light detectors. The equivalent position in the ventral eye is occupied by standard ommatidia. Third, ommatidia characteristically project mechanosensory hairs above their lenses, but in the most peripheral rows (including the DR) the ommatidia are bald. Wingless secreted from the head capsule appears to organize all these peripheral specializations. Higher Wg levels induce PR, intermediate levels induce DR, and lower levels induce baldness. The predisposition of dorsal cells to generate DR ommatidia appears to be endowed by the exclusive dorsal expression of Iroquois genes.",

        "Abstract": "Much of the cell-cell communication that controls assignment of cell fates during animal development appears to be mediated by extracellular signaling molecules. The formation of the proximodistal (P/D) axis of the legs of flies is controlled by at least two such molecules, a Wnt and a TGFbeta, encoded by the wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp) genes, respectively. The P/D axis appears to be initiated from the site where cells expressing wg are in close association with those expressing dpp. Support for this hypothesis comes from two sources: classical grafting experiments in cockroaches and ectopic protein expression in Drosophila.",
