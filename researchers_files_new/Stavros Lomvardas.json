Here, we propose that topographic restrictions in OR expression are established in neuronal progenitors by two opposing forces: polygenic transcription and genomic silencing, both of which are influenced by dorsoventral gradients of transcription factors NFIA, B, and X. Polygenic transcription of OR genes may define spatially constrained OR repertoires, among which one OR allele is selected for singular expression later in development. Heterochromatin assembly and genomic compartmentalization of OR alleles also vary across the axes of the olfactory epithelium and may preferentially eliminate ectopically expressed ORs with more dorsal expression destinations from this 'privileged' repertoire. Our experiments identify early transcription as a potential 'epigenetic' contributor to future developmental patterning and reveal how two spatially responsive probabilistic processes may act in concert to establish deterministic, precise, and reproducible territories of stochastic gene expression.",

        "Abstract": "Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) convert the stochastic choice of one of >1,000 olfactory receptor (OR) genes into precise and stereotyped axon targeting of OR-specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Here, we show that the PERK arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) regulates both the glomerular coalescence of like axons and the specificity of their projections. Subtle differences in OR protein sequences lead to distinct patterns of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during OSN development, converting OR identity into distinct gene expression signatures. We identify the transcription factor Ddit3 as a key effector of PERK signaling that maps OR-dependent ER stress patterns to the transcriptional regulation of axon guidance and cell-adhesion genes, instructing targeting precision. Our results extend the known functions of the UPR from a quality-control pathway that protects cells from misfolded proteins to a sensor of cellular identity that interprets physiological states to direct axon wiring.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infects less than 1% of cells in the human body, yet it can cause severe damage in a variety of organs. Thus, deciphering the non-cell-autonomous effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection is imperative for understanding the cellular and molecular disruption it elicits. Neurological and cognitive defects are among the least understood symptoms of COVID-19 patients, with olfactory dysfunction being their most common sensory deficit. Here, we show that both in humans and hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) and of their signaling components. This non-cell-autonomous effect is preceded by a dramatic reorganization of the neuronal nuclear architecture, which results in dissipation of genomic compartments harboring OR genes. Our data provide a potential mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the cellular morphology and the transcriptome of cells it cannot infect, offering insight to its systemic effects in olfaction and beyond.",

Choreographed changes to OSN nuclear architecture are evidently necessary for OR expression. Additionally, the insulated organization of OR-enhancers around an OR allele is a hallmark of the chosen OR. However, the biology guiding OR choice itself is unclear. Innovations in single-cell and biophysics-based analysis of nuclear architecture are revising previous models of the nucleus to include its dynamic and probabilistic nature. In this review, we ground current knowledge of OR gene regulation in these emerging theories to speculate on mechanisms that may give rise to diverse and singular OR expression.",

        "Abstract": "Olfaction relies on a coordinated partnership between odorant flow and neuronal communication. Disruption in our ability to detect odors, or anosmia, has emerged as a hallmark symptom of infection with SARS-CoV-2, yet the mechanism behind this abrupt sensory deficit remains elusive. Here, using molecular evaluation of human olfactory epithelium (OE) from subjects succumbing to COVID-19 and a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we discovered widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) as well as key components of their signaling pathway. OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters. Our experiments uncover a novel molecular mechanism by which a virus with a very selective tropism can elicit persistent transcriptional changes in cells that evade it, contributing to the severity of COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "The partitioning of the interphase nucleus into chromosome territories generally precludes DNA from making specific and reproducible inter-chromosomal contacts. However, with the development of powerful genomic and imaging tools for the analysis of the 3D genome, and with their application on an increasing number of cell types, it becomes apparent that regulated, specific, and functionally important inter-chromosomal contacts exist. Widespread and stereotypic inter-chromosomal interactions are at the center of chemosensation, where they regulate the singular and stochastic expression of olfactory receptor genes. In olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) coalescence of multiple intergenic enhancers to a multi-chromosomal hub orchestrates the expression of a single OR allele, whereas convergence of the remaining OR genes from 18 chromosomes into a few heterochromatic compartments mediates their effective transcriptional silencing. In this review we describe the role of interchromosomal interactions in OR gene choice, and we describe other biological systems where such genomic interactions may contribute to regulatory robustness and transcriptional diversification.",

        "Abstract": "The genome is partitioned into topologically associated domains and genomic compartments with shared chromatin valence. This architecture is constrained by the DNA polymer, which precludes interactions between genes on different chromosomes. Here we report a marked divergence from this pattern of nuclear organization that occurs in mouse olfactory sensory neurons. Chromatin conformation capture using in situ Hi-C on fluorescence-activated cell-sorted olfactory sensory neurons and their progenitors shows that olfactory receptor gene clusters from 18 chromosomes make specific and robust interchromosomal contacts that increase with differentiation of the cells. These contacts are orchestrated by intergenic olfactory receptor enhancers, the 'Greek islands', which first contribute to the formation of olfactory receptor compartments and then form a multi-chromosomal super-enhancer that associates with the single active olfactory receptor gene. The Greek-island-bound transcription factor LHX2 and adaptor protein LDB1 regulate the assembly and maintenance of olfactory receptor compartments, Greek island hubs and olfactory receptor transcription, providing mechanistic insights into and functional support for the role of trans interactions in gene expression.",

        "Abstract": "The monogenic and monoallelic expression of only one out of >1000 mouse olfactory receptor (ORs) genes requires the formation of large heterochromatic chromatin domains that sequester the OR gene clusters. Within these domains, intergenic transcriptional enhancers evade heterochromatic silencing and converge into interchromosomal hubs that assemble over the transcriptionally active OR. The significance of this nuclear organization in OR choice remains elusive. Here, we show that transcription factors Lhx2 and Ebf specify OR enhancers by binding in a functionally cooperative fashion to stereotypically spaced motifs that defy heterochromatin.

Enhancers also promise to be a great technological opportunity for neuroscience, offering the potential for cell-type-specific genetic labeling and manipulation without the need for transgenesis.

Breadth and sensitivity are provided by a huge number of chemosensory receptor proteins, including more than 1,400 olfactory receptors (ORs). Organizing the sensory information generated by these receptors so that it can be processed and evaluated by the central nervous system is a major challenge. This challenge is overcome by monogenic and monoallelic expression of OR genes. The single OR expressed by each olfactory sensory neuron determines the neuron's odor sensitivity and the axonal connections it will make to downstream neurons in the olfactory bulb. The expression of a single OR per neuron is accomplished by coupling a slow chromatin-mediated activation process to a fast negative-feedback signal that prevents activation of additional ORs. Singular OR activation is likely orchestrated by a network of interchromosomal enhancer interactions and large-scale changes in nuclear architecture.",

        "Abstract": "The senses provide a means by which data on the physical and chemical properties of the environment may be collected and meaningfully interpreted. Sensation begins at the periphery, where a multitude of different sensory cell types are activated by environmental stimuli as different as photons and odorant molecules. Stimulus sensitivity is due to expression of different cell surface sensory receptors, and therefore the receptive field of each sense is defined by the aggregate of expressed receptors in each sensory tissue. Here, we review current understanding on patterns of expression and modes of regulation of sensory receptors.",

        "Abstract": "An astounding property of the nervous system is its cellular diversity. This diversity, which was initially realized by morphological and electrophysiological differences, is ultimately produced by variations in gene-expression programs. In most cases, these variations are determined by external cues. However, a growing number of neuronal types have been identified in which inductive signals cannot explain the few but decisive transcriptional differences that cause cell diversification. Here, we show that heterochromatic silencing, which we find is governed by histone methyltransferases G9a (KMT1C) and GLP (KMT1D), is essential for stochastic and singular olfactory receptor (OR) expression. Deletion of G9a and GLP dramatically reduces the complexity of the OR transcriptome, resulting in transcriptional domination by a few ORs and loss of singularity in OR expression. Thus, our data suggest that, in addition to its previously known functions, heterochromatin creates an epigenetic platform that affords stochastic, mutually exclusive gene choices and promotes cellular diversity.",

        "Abstract": "The transcriptional activation of one out of ?2800 olfactory receptor (OR) alleles is a poorly understood process. Here, we identify a plethora of putative OR enhancers and study their in vivo activity in olfactory neurons. Distinguished by an unusual epigenetic signature, candidate OR enhancers are characterized by extensive interchromosomal interactions associated with OR transcription and share a similar pattern of transcription factor footprints. In particular, we establish the role of the transcription factor Bptf as a facilitator of both enhancer interactions and OR transcription. Our observations agree with the model whereby OR transcription occurs in the context of multiple interacting enhancers. Disruption of these interchromosomal interactions results in weak and multigenic OR expression, suggesting that the rare coincidence of numerous enhancers over a stochastically chosen OR may account for the singularity and robustness in OR transcription.",

        "Abstract": "During differentiation, neurons exhibit a reorganization of DNA modification patterns across their genomes. The de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a is implicated in this process, but the effects of its absence have not been fully characterized in a purified neuronal population. To better understand how DNA modifications contribute to neuronal function, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes of Dnmt3a-deficient mature olfactory sensory neurons (mOSNs), the primary sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium. Dnmt3a is required for both 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine patterning within accessible genomic regions, including hundreds of neurodevelopmental genes and neural enhancers. Loss of Dnmt3a results in the global disruption of gene expression via activation of silent genes and reduction of mOSN-expressed transcripts. Importantly, the DNA modification state and inducibility of odorant-activated genes are markedly impaired in Dnmt3a knockouts, suggesting a crucial role for this enzyme in establishing an epigenetic landscape compatible with neuronal plasticity.",

The mechanism by which olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) detect ORs to signal to the nucleus remains elusive. Here, we show that OR proteins generate this feedback by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). OR expression induces Perk-mediated phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eif2α causing selective translation of activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5). ATF5 induces the transcription of adenylyl cyclase 3 (Adcy3), which relieves the UPR. Our data provide a role for the UPR in defining neuronal identity and cell fate commitment and support a two-step model for the feedback signal: (1) OR protein, as a stress stimulus, alters the translational landscape of the OSN and induces Adcy3 expression; (2), Adcy3 relieves that stress, restores global translation, and makes OR choice permanent.",

        "Abstract": "The modified DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is enriched in neurons where it may contribute to gene regulation and cellular identity. To determine how 5hmC influences gene expression in an in vivo neuronal population, we assessed the patterning and function of the base along the developmental lineage of the main olfactory epithelium-from multipotent stem cells through neuronal progenitors to mature olfactory sensory neurons (mOSNs). We find that 5hmC increases over gene bodies during mOSN development with substantial patterning occuring between the progenitor and mOSN stages. Although gene-body 5hmC levels correlate with gene expression in all three developmental cell types, this association is particularly pronounced within mOSNs. Overexpression of Tet3 in mOSNs markedly alters gene-body 5hmC levels and gene expression in a manner consistent with a positive role for 5hmC in transcription. Moreover, Tet3 overexpression disrupts olfactory receptor expression and the targeting of axons to the olfactory bulb, key molecular and anatomical features of the olfactory system. Our results suggest a physiologically significant role for gene-body 5hmC in transcriptional facilitation and the maintenance of cellular identity independent of its function as an intermediate to demethylation.",

        "Abstract": "The molecular mechanisms regulating olfactory receptor (OR) expression in the mammalian nose are not yet understood. Here, we identify the transient expression of histone demethylase LSD1 and the OR-dependent expression of adenylyl cyclase 3 (Adcy3) as requirements for initiation and stabilization of OR expression. As a transcriptional coactivator, LSD1 is necessary for desilencing and initiating OR transcription, but as a transcriptional corepressor, it is incompatible with maintenance of OR expression, and its downregulation is imperative for stable OR choice. Adcy3, a sensor of OR expression and a transmitter of an OR-elicited feedback, mediates the downregulation of LSD1 and promotes the differentiation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). This novel, three-node signaling cascade locks the epigenetic state of the chosen OR, stabilizes its singular expression, and prevents the transcriptional activation of additional OR alleles for the life of the neuron.",

        "Abstract": "One of the remarkable characteristics of higher organisms is the enormous assortment of cell types that emerge from a common genome. The immune system, with the daunting duty of detecting an astounding number of pathogens, and the nervous system with the equally bewildering task of perceiving and interpreting the external world, are the quintessence of cellular diversity. As we began to appreciate decades ago, achieving distinct expression programs among similar cell types cannot be accomplished solely by deterministic regulatory systems, but by the involvement of some type of stochasticity. In the last few years our understanding of these non-deterministic mechanisms is advancing, and this review will provide a brief summary of the current view of stochastic gene expression with focus on olfactory receptor (OR) gene choice, the epigenetic underpinnings of which recently began to emerge.",

        "Abstract": "Gene positioning and regulation of nuclear architecture are thought to influence gene expression. Here, we show that, in mouse olfactory neurons, silent olfactory receptor (OR) genes from different chromosomes converge in a small number of heterochromatic foci. These foci are OR exclusive and form in a cell-type-specific and differentiation-dependent manner. The aggregation of OR genes is developmentally synchronous with the downregulation of lamin b receptor (LBR) and can be reversed by ectopic expression of LBR in mature olfactory neurons. LBR-induced reorganization of nuclear architecture and disruption of OR aggregates perturbs the singularity of OR transcription and disrupts the targeting specificity of the olfactory neurons. Our observations propose spatial sequestering of heterochromatinized OR family members as a basis of monogenic and monoallelic gene expression.",

        "Abstract": "The olfactory receptor (OR) genes are the largest mammalian gene family and are expressed in a monogenic and monoallelic fashion in olfactory neurons. Using a high-throughput approach, we mapped the transcription start sites of 1085 of the 1400 murine OR genes and performed computational analysis that revealed potential transcription factor binding sites shared by the majority of these promoters. Our analysis produced a hierarchical model for OR promoter recognition in which unusually high AT content, a unique epigenetic signature, and a stereotypically positioned O/E site distinguish OR promoters from the rest of the murine promoters. Our computations revealed an intriguing correlation between promoter AT content and evolutionary plasticity, as the most AT-rich promoters regulate rapidly evolving gene families. Within the AT-rich promoter category the position of the TATA-box does not correlate with the transcription start site. Instead, a spike in GC composition might define the exact location of the TSS, introducing the concept of \"genomic contrast\" in transcriptional regulation. Finally, our experiments show that genomic neighborhood rather than promoter sequence correlates with the probability of different OR genes to be expressed in the same olfactory cell.",

        "Abstract": "Constitutive heterochromatin is traditionally viewed as the static form of heterochromatin that silences pericentromeric and telomeric repeats in a cell cycle- and differentiation-independent manner. Here, we show that, in the mouse olfactory epithelium, olfactory receptor (OR) genes are marked in a highly dynamic fashion with the molecular hallmarks of constitutive heterochromatin, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3. The cell type and developmentally dependent deposition of these marks along the OR clusters are, most likely, reversed during the process of OR choice to allow for monogenic and monoallelic OR expression. In contrast to the current view of OR choice, our data suggest that OR silencing takes place before OR expression, indicating that it is not the product of an OR-elicited feedback signal. Our findings suggest that chromatin-mediated silencing lays a molecular foundation upon which singular and stochastic selection for gene expression can be applied.",

        "Abstract": "The expression of a single odorant receptor (OR) gene from a large gene family in individual sensory neurons is an essential feature of the organization and function of the olfactory system. We have used chromosome conformation capture to demonstrate the specific association of an enhancer element, H, on chromosome 14 with multiple OR gene promoters on different chromosomes. DNA and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments allow us to visualize the colocalization of the H enhancer with the single OR allele that is transcribed in a sensory neuron. In transgenic mice bearing additional H elements, sensory neurons that express OR pseudogenes also express a second functional receptor. These data suggest a model of receptor choice in which a single trans-acting enhancer element may allow the stochastic activation of only one OR allele in an olfactory sensory neuron.",

        "Title": "p38 MAP kinase mediates both short-term and long-term synaptic depression in aplysia.",
        "Abstract": "At Aplysia sensory-to-motor neuron synapses, the inhibitory neuropeptide Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (FMRFa) produces depression, and serotonin (5-HT) produces facilitation. Short-term depression has been found to result from the activation of a phospholipase A2. The released arachidonate is metabolized by 12-lipoxygenase to active second messengers. We find that FMRFa leads to the phosphorylation and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Short-term depression and the release of arachidonate are blocked by the specific p38 kinase inhibitor SB 203580. Both the inhibitor and an affinity-purified antibody raised against recombinant Aplysia p38 kinase injected into sensory neurons prevented long-term depression, which depends on the phosphorylation of translation factors cAMP response element-binding protein 2 (CREB2) and activating transcription factor 2. Facilitation produced by 5-HT, on the other hand, inactivates p38 kinase. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that p38 kinase activates CREB2. p38 kinase also is pivotal in the bidirectional regulation of synaptic plasticity: when the kinase is inhibited, brief treatment with 5-HT that normally produces only short-term facilitation now results in long-term facilitation. Conversely, in sensory neurons injected with the activated kinase, long-term facilitation is blocked, and brief exposure to FMRFa, which normally results in short-term depression, results in long-term depression. We conclude that p38 kinase, which itself is bidirectionally regulated by FMRFa and 5-HT, acts as a modulator of synaptic plasticity by positively regulating depression and serving as an inhibitory constraint for facilitation.",

        "Abstract": "Excitatory and inhibitory inputs converge on single neurons and are integrated into a coherent output. Although much is known about short-term integration, little is known about how neurons sum opposing signals for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory storage. In Aplysia, we find that when a sensory neuron simultaneously receives inputs from the facilitatory transmitter 5-HT at one set of synapses and the inhibitory transmitter FMRFamide at another, long-term facilitation is blocked and synapse-specific long-term depression dominates. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that 5-HT induces the downstream gene C/EBP by activating CREB1, which recruits CBP for histone acetylation, whereas FMRFa leads to CREB1 displacement by CREB2 and recruitment of HDAC5 to deacetylate histones. When the two transmitters are applied together, facilitation is blocked because CREB2 and HDAC5 displace CREB1-CBP, thereby deacetylating histones.",

        "Abstract": "Transcriptional activation of the IFN-beta gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, which instructs a recruitment program of chromatin modifiers/remodelers and general transcription factors to the promoter. This program culminates with sliding of a nucleosome blocking the core promoter to a downstream position, a prerequisite for transcriptional activation. We show that delivery of this nucleosome to the same downstream position to create an accessible IFN-beta core promoter prior to enhanceosome assembly results in major changes in the gene expression program with regard to the temporal pattern and the signal specificity of the transcriptional response. Thus, the identity of a gene expression program is achieved and maintained by the dynamic interplay between specific enhanceosomes and specific local chromatin structure.",
