        "Title": "A scene with an invisible wall - navigational experience shapes visual scene representation.",
        "Abstract": "Human navigation heavily relies on visual information. Although many previous studies have investigated how navigational information is inferred from visual features of scenes, little is understood about the impact of navigational experience on visual scene representation. In this study, we examined how navigational experience influences both the behavioral and neural responses to a visual scene. During training, participants navigated in the virtual reality (VR) environments which we manipulated navigational experience while holding the visual properties of scenes constant. Half of the environments allowed free navigation (navigable), while the other half featured an 'invisible wall' preventing the participants to continue forward even though the scene was visually navigable (non-navigable). During testing, participants viewed scene images from the VR environment while completing either a behavioral perceptual identification task (Experimentl) or an fMRI scan (Experiment2). Behaviorally, we found that participants judged a scene pair to be significantly more visually different if their prior navigational experience varied, even after accounting for visual similarities between the scene pairs. Neurally, multi-voxel pattern of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) distinguished visual scenes based on prior navigational experience alone. These results suggest that the human visual scene cortex represents information about navigability obtained through prior experience, beyond those computable from the visual properties of the scene. Taken together, these results suggest that scene representation is modulated by prior navigational experience to help us construct a functionally meaningful visual environment.",

        "Abstract": "All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) possess the advantage of ensuring safety while simultaneously maximizing energy density, making them suitable for next-generation battery models. In particular, sulfide solid electrolytes (SSEs) are viewed as promising candidates for ASSB electrolytes due to their excellent ionic conductivity. However, a limitation exists in the form of interfacial side reactions occurring between the SSEs and cathode active materials (CAMs), as well as the generation of sulfide-based gases within the SSE. These issues lead to a reduction in the capacity of CAMs and an increase in internal resistance within the cell. To address these challenges, cathode composite materials incorporating zinc oxide (ZnO) are fabricated, effectively reducing various side reactions occurring in CAMs. Acting as a semiconductor, ZnO helps mitigate the rapid oxidation of the solid electrolyte facilitated by an electronic pathway, thereby minimizing side reactions, while maintaining electron pathways to the active material. Additionally, it absorbs sulfide-based gases, thus protecting the lithium ions within CAMs. In this study, the mass spectrometer is employed to observe gas generation phenomena within the ASSB cell. Furthermore, a clear elucidation of the side reactions occurring at the cathode and the causes of capacity reduction in ASSB are provided through density functional theory calculations.",

        "Title": "Combined representation of visual features in the scene-selective cortex.",
        "Abstract": "Visual features of separable dimensions conjoin to represent an integrated entity. We investigated how visual features bind to form a complex visual scene. Specifically, we focused on features important for visually guided navigation: direction and distance. Previously, separate works have shown that directions and distances of navigable paths are coded in the occipital place area (OPA). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested how separate features are concurrently represented in the OPA. Participants saw eight types of scenes, in which four of them had one path and the other four had two paths. In single-path scenes, path direction was either to the left or to the right. In double-path scenes, both directions were present. A glass wall was placed in some paths to restrict navigational distance. To test how the OPA represents path directions and distances, we took three approaches. First, the independent-features approach examined whether the OPA codes each direction and distance. Second, the integrated-features approach explored how directions and distances are integrated into path units, as compared to pooled features, using double-path scenes. Finally, the integrated-paths approach asked how separate paths are combined into a scene. Using multi-voxel pattern similarity analysis, we found that the OPA's representations of single-path scenes were similar to other single-path scenes of either the same direction or the same distance. Representations of double-path scenes were similar to the combination of two constituent single-paths, as a combined unit of direction and distance rather than as a pooled representation of all features. These results show that the OPA combines the two features to form path units, which are then used to build multiple-path scenes. Altogether, these results suggest that visually guided navigation may be supported by the OPA that automatically and efficiently combines multiple features relevant for navigation and represent a navigation file.",

        "Abstract": "The current high-capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), reliant on flammable liquid electrolytes (LEs) and nickel-rich cathodes, are plagued by safety hazards, especially the risk of hazardous gas release stemming from internal side reactions. To address these safety concerns, an electron beam (E-beam)-induced gel polymer electrolyte (E-Gel) is introduced, employing dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate (DPH) as a bi-functional cross-linkable additive (CIA). The dual roles of DPH are exploited through a strategically designed E-beam irradiation process. Applying E-beam irradiation on the pre-cycled cells allows DPH to function as an additive during the initial cycle, establishing a protective layer on the surface of the anode and cathode and as a cross-linker during the E-beam irradiation step, forming a polymer framework. The prepared E-Gel with CIA has superior interfacial compatibility, facilitating lithium-ion diffusion at the electrode/E-Gel interface. The electrochemical assessment of 1.2 Ah pouch cells demonstrates that E-Gel substantially reduces gas release by 2.5 times compared to commercial LEs during the initial formation stage and ensures superior reversible capacity retention even after prolonged cycling at 55 °C. The research underscores the synergy of bifunctional CIA with E-beam technology, paving the way for large-scale production of safe, high-capacity, and commercially viable LIBs.",

        "Abstract": "Lithium metal anode (LMA) emerges as a promising candidate for lithium (Li)-based battery chemistries with high-energy-density. However, inhomogeneous charge distribution from the unbalanced ion/electron transport causes dendritic Li deposition, leading to \"dead Li\" and parasitic reactions, particularly at high Li utilization ratios (low negative/positive ratios in full cells). Herein, an innovative LMA structural model deploying a hyperporous/hybrid conductive architecture is proposed on single-walled carbon nanotube film (HCA/C), fabricated through a nonsolvent induced phase separation process. This design integrates ionic polymers with conductive carbon, offering a substantial improvement over traditional metal current collectors by reducing the weight of LMA and enabling high-energy-density batteries. The HCA/C promotes uniform lithium deposition even under rapid charging (up to 5 mA cm",

        "Abstract": "The goals of the present study were to develop a simple method for obtain highly purified pig sperm hyaluronidase (pHyase) and to assess its activity, function, and safety. In mammals, sperm-specific glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored Hyase assists sperm penetration through the cumulus mass surrounding the egg and aids in the dispersal of the cumulus-oocyte complex. Recently, Purified bovine sperm hyaluronidase (bHyase) has been shown to enhance therapeutic drug transport by breaking down the hyaluronan barrier to the lymphatic and capillary vessels, thereby facilitating tissue absorption. Commercially available Hyase is typically isolated from bovine or ovine; which have several disadvantages, including the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, low homology with human Hyase, and the requirement for relatively complex isolation procedures. This study successfully isolated highly purified pHyase in only two steps, using ammonium sulfate precipitation and fast protein liquid chromatography. The isolated Hyase had activity equal to that of commercial bHyase, facilitated in vitro fertilization, and effectively dissolved high molecule hyaluronic acid. This simple, effective isolation method could improve the availability of pHyase for research and clinical applications.",

        "Abstract": "Sirtuin3 (Sirt3) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide enzyme that contributes to aging, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have reported that Sirt3 exerts anti-inflammatory effects in several neuropathophysiological disorders. As epilepsy is a common neurological disease, in the present study, we investigated the role of Sirt3 in astrocyte activation and inflammatory processes after epileptic seizures. We found the elevated expression of Sirt3 within reactive astrocytes as well as in the surrounding cells in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and a mouse model of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). The upregulation of Sirt3 by treatment with adjudin, a potential Sirt3 activator, alleviated SE-induced astrocyte activation; whereas, Sirt3 deficiency exacerbated astrocyte activation in the hippocampus after SE. In addition, our results showed that Sirt3 upregulation attenuated the activation of Notch1 signaling, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity, and the production of interleukin-1β (IL1β) in the hippocampus after SE. By contrast, Sirt3 deficiency enhanced the activity of Notch1/NF-κB signaling and the production of IL1β. These findings suggest that Sirt3 regulates astrocyte activation by affecting the Notch1/NF-κB signaling pathway, which contributes to the inflammatory response after SE. Therefore, therapies targeting Sirt3 may be a worthy direction for limiting inflammatory responses following epileptic brain injury.",

        "Abstract": "Modern strides in energy storage underscore the significance of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) predicated on solid electrolytes and lithium (Li) metal anodes in response to the demand for safer batteries. Nonetheless, ASSBs are often beleaguered by non-uniform Li deposition during cycling, leading to compromised cell performance from internal short circuits and hindered charge transfer. In this study, the concept of \"bottom deposition\" is introduced to stabilize metal deposition based on the lithiophilic current collector and a protective layer composed of a polymeric binder and carbon black. The bottom deposition, wherein Li plating ensues between the protective layer and the current collector, circumvents internal short circuits and facilitates uniform volumetric changes of Li. The prepared functional binder for the protective layer presents outstanding mechanical robustness and adhesive properties, which can withstand the volume expansion caused by metal growth. Furthermore, its excellent ion transfer properties promote uniform Li bottom deposition even under a current density of 6 mA·cm",

The inherent potential offers considerable advantages for substantially increasing the energy density in batteries, capable of maximizing the benefit by changing the paradigm from nano- to micron-sized Si particles. Nevertheless, intrinsic structural instability remains a significant barrier to its practical application, especially for larger Si particles. Here, a covalently interconnected system is reported employing Si microparticles (5 µm) and a highly elastic gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) through electron beam irradiation. The integrated system mitigates the substantial volumetric expansion of pure Si, enhancing overall stability, while accelerating charge carrier kinetics due to the high ionic conductivity. Through the cost-effective but practical approach of electron beam technology, the resulting 500 mAh-pouch cell showed exceptional stability and high gravimetric/volumetric energy densities of 413 Wh kg",

        "Abstract": "To estimate the size of an indoor space, we must analyze the visual boundaries that limit the spatial extent and acoustic cues from reflected interior surfaces. We used fMRI to examine how the brain processes the geometric size of indoor scenes when various types of sensory cues are presented individually or together. Specifically, we asked whether the size of space is represented in a modality-specific way or in an integrative way that combines multimodal cues. In a block-design study, images or sounds that depict small- and large-sized indoor spaces were presented. Visual stimuli were real-world pictures of empty spaces that were small or large. Auditory stimuli were sounds convolved with different reverberations. By using a multivoxel pattern classifier, we asked whether the two sizes of space can be classified in visual, auditory, and visual-auditory combined conditions. We identified both sensory-specific and multimodal representations of the size of space. To further investigate the nature of the multimodal region, we specifically examined whether it contained multimodal information in a coexistent or integrated form. We found that angular gyrus and the right medial frontal gyrus had modality-integrated representation, displaying sensitivity to the match in the spatial size information conveyed through image and sound. Background functional connectivity analysis further demonstrated that the connection between sensory-specific regions and modality-integrated regions increases in the multimodal condition compared with single modality conditions. Our results suggest that spatial size perception relies on both sensory-specific and multimodal representations, as well as their interplay during multimodal perception.",

We aimed to compare thyroid cancer screening rates of residents living near NPPs to those of the general population. This study utilized data from two national survey-based studies in 2016 and in 2014, respectively, for residents (n = 1,200) living in administrative districts within 5 km of NPP sites as the interest group, and the general population (n = 228,712) including distant-living residents (n = 19,100) in administrative districts within 30 km of NPP sites as reference groups. We observed an increase in screening rates in residents near NPPs, which may lead to a higher possibility of thyroid cancer detection. Therefore, further epidemiological studies investigating radiation-induced thyroid cancer risk among residents near NPPs should be carefully designed and interpreted considering possible detection bias.",

        "Abstract": "Transient receptor potential vanilloid 6 (TRPV6) is a highly selective calcium-ion channel that belongs to the TRPV family. TRPV6 is widely distributed in the brain, but its role in neurological diseases such as epilepsy remains unknown. Here, we report for the first time that TRPV6 expression is upregulated in the hippocampus of a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus model, mainly in the suprapyramidal bundle of the mossy fiber (MF) projection of the hippocampal CA3 regions. We found that TRPV6 overexpression via viral vector transduction attenuated abnormal MF sprouting (MFS), whereas TRPV6 knockdown aggravated the development of MFS and the incidence of recurrent seizures during epileptogenic progression. In the in vitro experiments, our results showed that modulation of TRPV6 expression resulted in a change in axonal formation in cultured hippocampal neurons. In addition, we found that TRPV6 was implicated in the regulation of Akt-glycogen synthase kinase-3-β activity, which is closely related to the cellular mechanism of axonal outgrowth. Therefore, these findings suggest that TRPV6 may regulate the formation of aberrant synaptic circuits during epileptogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "How continuous cerebral autoregulation (CCA) knowledge should be optimally gained and interpreted is still an active area of research and refinement. We now experience a unique situation of having indices clinically available before definitive evidence of benefit or practice guidelines, in a moment when high rates of institutional variability exist both in the application of monitoring as well as in monitoring-guided treatments. Responses from 47 international clinicians, experts in this field, were collected with polling and discussion of the results. The clinical use of CCA in critical illness was not universal among experts, with 34% not using it. Of those who use a CCA index in clinical practice, 64% use intracranial pressure-based Pressure Reactivity index (PRx). There seems to exist a considerable trust in the physiologic plausibility of CCA to guide individual arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure therapy and provide benefit, regardless of the difficulty of proving this. A total of 59% feel the need for phase II and III prospective studies but would continue to use CCA information in their practice even if randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not show clear clinical benefit. There was nearly universal interest to participate in an RCT, with agreement that the research community must together determine end points and interventions to reduce wasted effort and time, and that investigations should include the following: the most appropriate way of inclusion of CCA into the clinical workflow; whether CCA-guided interventions should be prophylactic, proactive; or reactive; and whether a CCA-centric (unimodal) or a multimodal monitoring-integrated tiered therapy approach should be adopted. Pediatric and neonatal populations were highlighted as having urgent need and even more plausibility than adults. On the whole, the initiative was enthusiastically embraced by the experts, with the general feeling that a strong push should be now made by the community to convert the plausible benefits of CCA monitoring, already implemented in some centers, into a more standardized and RCT-validated clinical reality.",

        "Abstract": "Advanced energy-storage devices are indispensable for expanding electric mobility applications. While anion intercalation-type redox chemistry in graphite cathodes has opened the path to high-energy-density batteries, surpassing the limited energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries , a significant challenge remains: the large volume expansion of graphite upon anion intercalation. In this study, a novel polymeric binder and cohesive graphite cathode design for dual-ion batteries (DIBs) is presented, which exhibits remarkable stability even under high voltage conditions (>5 V). The innovative binder incorporates an acrylate moiety ensuring superior oxidative stability and self-healing features, along with an azide moiety, which allows for azacyclic covalent bonding with graphite and interchain crosslinking. A simple 1-h ultraviolet treatment is sufficient for binder fixation within the electrode, leading to the covalent bond formation with graphite and the creation of a robust three-dimensional network. This modification facilitates deeper and more reversible anion intercalation, leading to improved capacity, extended lifespan, and sustainable anion storage. The binder design, exhibiting exceptional adhesive properties and effective stress mitigation, enables the construction of ultrathick graphite cathodes. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of advanced binders, paving the way for high-performance DIBs.",

One of the main reasons for mortality in these patients is withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. There is a need for precise and equitable prognostication tools to support families in avoiding premature or inappropriate WLST. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) have been noted for their association with outcome, and are positioned to be a useful modality for prognostication.",

        "Abstract": "To estimate the size of an indoor space, we must analyze the visual boundaries that limit the spatial extent and acoustic cues from reflected interior surfaces. We used fMRI to examine how the brain processes geometric size of indoor scenes when various types of sensory cues are presented individually or together. Specifically, we asked whether the size of space is represented in a modality-specific way or in an integrative way that combines multimodal cues. In a block-design study, images or sounds that depict small and large sized indoor spaces were presented. Visual stimuli were real-world pictures of empty spaces that were small or large. Auditory stimuli were sounds convolved with different reverberation. By using a multi-voxel pattern classifier, we asked whether the two sizes of space can be classified in visual, auditory, and visual-auditory combined conditions. We identified both sensory specific and multimodal representations of the size of space. To further investigate the nature of the multimodal region, we specifically examined whether it contained multimodal information in a coexistent or integrated form. We found that AG and the right IFG pars opercularis had modality-integrated representation, displaying sensitivity to the match in the spatial size information conveyed through image and sound. Background functional connectivity analysis further demonstrated that the connection between sensory specific regions and modality-integrated regions increase in the multimodal condition compared to single modality conditions. Our results suggest that the spatial size perception relies on both sensory specific and multimodal representations, as well as their interplay during multimodal perception.",

        "Abstract": "Visual features of separable dimensions like color and shape conjoin to represent an integrated entity. We investigated how visual features bind to form a complex visual scene. Specifically, we focused on features important for visually guided navigation: direction and distance. Previously, separate works have shown that directions and distances of navigable paths are coded in the occipital place area (OPA). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested how separate features are concurrently represented in the OPA. Participants saw eight different types of scenes, in which four of them had one path and the other four had two paths. In single-path scenes, path direction was either to the left or to the right. In double-path scenes, both directions were present. Each path contained a glass wall located either near or far, changing the navigational distance. To test how the OPA represents paths in terms of direction and distance features, we took three approaches. First, the independent-features approach examined whether the OPA codes directions and distances independently in single-path scenes. Second, the integrated-features approach explored how directions and distances are integrated into path units, as compared to pooled features, using double-path scenes. Finally, the integrated-paths approach asked how separate paths are combined into a scene. Using multi-voxel pattern similarity analysis, we found that the OPA's representations of single-path scenes were similar to other single-path scenes of either the same direction or the same distance. Representations of double-path scenes were similar to the combination of two constituent single-paths, as a combined unit of direction and distance rather than pooled representation of all features. These results show that the OPA combines the two features to form path units, which are then used to build multiple-path scenes. Altogether, these results suggest that visually guided navigation may be supported by the OPA that automatically and efficiently combines multiple features relevant for navigation and represent a ",

However, the practical application of flexible LIBs in devices has been plagued by the challenge of simultaneously achieving high energy density and high flexibility. Herein, a hierarchical 3D electrode (H3DE) is introduced with high mass loading that can construct highly flexible LIBs with ultrahigh energy density. The H3DE features a bicontinuous structure and the active materials along with conductive agents are uniformly distributed on the 3D framework regardless of the active material type. The bicontinuous electrode/electrolyte integration enables a rapid ion/electron transport, thereby improving the redox kinetics and lowering the internal cell resistance. Moreover, the H3DE exhibits exceptional structural integrity and flexibility during repeated mechanical deformations. Benefiting from the remarkable physicochemical properties, pouch-type flexible LIBs using H3DE demonstrate stable cycling under various bending states, achieving a record-high energy density (438.6 Wh kg",

        "Title": "Constructing Pure Si Anodes for Advanced Lithium Batteries.",
        "Abstract": "ConspectusWith the escalating demands of portable electronics, electric vehicles, and grid-scale energy storage systems, the development of next-generation rechargeable batteries, which boasts high energy density, cost effectiveness, and environmental sustainability, becomes imperative. Accelerating these advancements could substantially mitigate detrimental carbon emissions. The pursuit of main objectives has kindled interest in pure silicon as a high-capacity electroactive material, capable of further enhancing the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities compared with traditional graphite counterparts. Despite such promising attributes, pure silicon materials face significant hurdles, primarily due to their drastic volumetric changes during the lithiation/delithiation processes. Volume changes give rise to severe side effects, such as fracturing, pulverization, and delamination, triggering rapid capacity decay. Therefore, mitigating silicon particle fracture remains a primary challenge. Importantly, nanoscale silicon (below 150 nm in size) has shown resilience to stresses induced by repeated volume changes, thereby highlighting its potential as an anode-active material. However, the volume expansion stress not only affects the internal structure of the particle but also disrupts the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, formed spontaneously on the outer surface of silicon, causing adverse side reactions. Therefore, despite silicon nanoparticles offering new opportunities, overcoming the associated issues is of paramount importance.Thus, this Account aims to spotlight the significant strides made in the development of pure silicon anodes with particular attention to feature size. From the emergence of nanoscale silicon, the following nanotechnology played a crucial role in growing the particle through nano/microstructuring. Similarly, bulk silicon microparticles gradually surfaced with the post-engineering methods owing to their practical advantages. We briefly discuss the special characteristics of representative examples from bulk silicon engineering and nano/microstructuring, all aimed at overcoming intrinsic challenges, such as limiting large volume changes and stabilizing SEI formation during electrochemical cycling. Subsequently, we outline guidelines for advancing pure silicon anodes to incorporate high mass loading and high energy density. Importantly, these advancements require superior material design and the incorporation of exceptional battery components to ensure compatibility and yield synergistic effects. By broadening the cooperative strategies at the cell and system levels, we anticipate that this Account will provide an insightful analysis of pure silicon anodes and catalyze their practical applications in real battery systems.",

We designed a deep learning framework using a domain adversarial neural network to estimate noninvasive ICP, from blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and cerebral blood flow velocity. Our model had a mean of median absolute error of 3.88 ± 3.26 mmHg for the domain adversarial neural network, and 3.94 ± 1.71 mmHg for the domain adversarial transformers. Compared with nonlinear approaches, such as support vector regression, this was 26.7% and 25.7% lower. Our proposed framework provides more accurate noninvasive ICP estimates than currently available. ANN NEUROL 2023;94:196-202.",

        "Abstract": "Spermatozoa have a streamlined shape to swim through the oviduct to fertilize oocytes. To become svelte spermatozoa, spermatid cytoplasm must be eliminated in several steps including sperm release, which is part of spermiation. Although this process has been well observed, the molecular mechanisms that underlie it remain unclear. In male germ cells, there are membraneless organelles called nuage, which are observed by electron microscopy in various forms of dense material. Reticulated body (RB) and chromatoid body remnant (CR) are two types of nuage in spermatids, but the functions of both are unknown. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we deleted the entire coding sequence of testis-specific serine kinase substrate (TSKS) in mice and demonstrate that TSKS is essential for male fertility through the formation of both RB and CR, prominent sites of TSKS localization. Due to the lack of TSKS-derived nuage (TDN), the cytoplasmic contents cannot be eliminated from spermatid cytoplasm in ",

Eugenol is the major phytoconstituent of essential oils extracted from several plants and possesses protective and anticonvulsant properties. However, it remains unclear whether eugenol exerts an anti-inflammatory effect to protect against severe neuronal damage induced by epileptic seizures. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory action of eugenol in an experimental epilepsy model of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). To examine the protective effect of eugenol via anti-inflammatory mechanisms, eugenol (200 mg/kg) was administrated daily for three days after pilocarpine-induced SE onset. The anti-inflammatory action of eugenol was evaluated by examining the expression of reactive gliosis, pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat with a pyrin-domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Our results showed that eugenol reduced SE-induced apoptotic neuronal cell death, mitigated the activation of astrocytes and microglia, and attenuated the expression of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor α in the hippocampus after SE onset. Furthermore, eugenol inhibited NF-κB activation and the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the hippocampus after SE. These results suggest that eugenol is a potential phytoconstituent that suppresses the neuroinflammatory processes induced by epileptic seizures. Therefore, these findings provide evidence that eugenol has therapeutic potential for epileptic seizures.",

        "Abstract": "Previously, we found that dysfunctional natural killer (NK) cells with low interferon gamma (IFN-γ) were restored in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by the FLT4 antagonist MAZ51. Here, we developed 12 peptides targeting FLT4 for clinical application and examined whether they restored the frequency of lymphocytes, especially T cells and NK cells, and high IFN-γ expression, as MAZ51 treatment did in our previous study. Although clinical data from using peptides are currently available, peptides targeting FLT4 to modulate immune cells have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we focus on novel peptide 4 (P4) from the intracellular domain of FLT4 because it had dominant negative activity. Similar to MAZ51, high IFN-γ levels were expressed in AML-mononuclear cells exposed to P4. Additionally, T and NK cell levels were restored, as were high IFN-γ levels, in a leukemic environment when P4 was treated. Interestingly, the regulatory T cells were significantly decreased by P4, implying the role of peptide in tumor niche. Overall, we demonstrated the therapeutic value of functionally modulating lymphocytes using a peptide targeting FLT4 and proposed the development of advanced therapeutic approaches against AML by using immune cells.",

        "Abstract": "Despite recent advancements in our understanding of genetic etiology and its molecular and physiological consequences, it is not yet clear what genetic features determine the inheritance pattern of a disease. To address this issue, we conducted whole exome sequencing analysis to characterize genetic variants in 1,180 Korean patients with neurological symptoms. The diagnostic yield for definitive pathogenic variant findings was 50.8%, after including 33 cases (5.9%) additionally diagnosed by reanalysis. Of diagnosed patients, 33.4% carried inherited variants. At the genetic level, autosomal recessive-inherited genes were characterized by enrichments in metabolic process, muscle organization and metal ion homeostasis pathways. Transcriptome and interactome profiling analyses revealed less brain-centered expression and fewer protein-protein interactions for recessive genes. The majority of autosomal recessive genes were more tolerant of variation, and functional prediction scores of recessively-inherited variants tended to be lower than those of dominantly-inherited variants. Additionally, we were able to predict the rates of carriers for recessive variants. Our results showed that genes responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders harbor different molecular mechanisms and expression patterns according to their inheritance patterns. Also, calculated frequency rates for recessive variants could be utilized to pre-screen rare neurodevelopmental disorder carriers.",

        "Abstract": "Wearable electronics is a growing field that has important applications in advanced human-integrated systems with high performance and mechanical deformability, especially foldable characteristics. Although foldable electronics such as rollable TVs (LG signature OLED R) or foldable smartphones (Samsung Galaxy Z fold/flip series) have been successfully established in the market, these devices are still powered by rigid and stiff batteries. Therefore, to realize fully wearable devices, it is necessary to develop state-of-the-art foldable batteries with high performance and safety in dynamic deformation states. In this review, we cover the recent progress in developing materials and system designs for foldable batteries. The Materials section is divided into three sections aimed at helping researchers choose suitable materials for their systems. Several foldable battery systems are discussed and the combination of innovative materials and system design that yields successful devices is considered. Furthermore, the basic analysis process of electrochemical and mechanical properties is provided as a guide for researchers interested in the evaluation of foldable battery systems. The current challenges facing the practical application of foldable batteries are briefly discussed. This review will help researchers to understand various aspects (from material preparation to battery configuration) of foldable batteries and provide a brief guideline for evaluating the performance of these batteries.",

        "Title": "Spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage.",
        "Abstract": "Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is the third most common subtype of stroke. Incidence has decreased over past decades, possibly in part related to lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation and management of hypertension. Approximately a quarter of patients with SAH die before hospital admission; overall outcomes are improved in those admitted to hospital, but with elevated risk of long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae such as depression. The disease continues to have a major public health impact as the mean age of onset is in the mid-fifties, leading to many years of reduced quality of life. The clinical presentation varies, but severe, sudden onset of headache is the most common symptom, variably associated with meningismus, transient or prolonged unconsciousness, and focal neurological deficits including cranial nerve palsies and paresis. Diagnosis is made by CT scan of the head possibly followed by lumbar puncture. Aneurysms are commonly the underlying vascular cause of spontaneous SAH and are diagnosed by angiography. Emergent therapeutic interventions are focused on decreasing the risk of rebleeding (ie, preventing hypertension and correcting coagulopathies) and, most crucially, early aneurysm treatment using coil embolisation or clipping. Management of the disease is best delivered in specialised intensive care units and high-volume centres by a multidisciplinary team. Increasingly, early brain injury presenting as global cerebral oedema is recognised as a potential treatment target but, currently, disease management is largely focused on addressing secondary complications such as hydrocephalus, delayed cerebral ischaemia related to microvascular dysfunction and large vessel vasospasm, and medical complications such as stunned myocardium and hospital acquired infections.",

Sixteen molars, including eight natural intact teeth and eight restored teeth with gold inlays, were selected from the participants. Custom-made thermocouple sensors were attached to the coronal third of the buccal surface of teeth. Participants consecutively consumed hot and cold drinks according to a standardized regimen. Resting, maximum, and minimum temperatures; time to reach peak temperatures; and heating and cooling velocities were obtained. Statistical analysis was performed using independent two-sample t-test. Teeth with gold restorations showed a significantly higher maximum temperature (44.7 °C [SD 2.9]) than did natural teeth (40.5 °C [SD 1.2]) during hot water drinking and showed a lower minimum temperature (25.0 °C [SD 4.9]) than did natural teeth (31.5 °C [SD 3.1]) during cold water drinking. The heating and cooling rates for the teeth with gold restorations were two and three times higher than those of the natural teeth. Gold-restored teeth showed greater temperature change than intact teeth in terms of magnitude and velocity in response to temperature changes induced by hot and cold drinks.",

        "Abstract": "This study aims to analyze the relationship between cognitive function and out-of-pocket cost of the state change of multiple chronic conditions in individuals aged 60 or older. Data from the 2014 to 2018 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging were used for 2202 older adults who were cognitively “normal” at the start of the survey. Four status change groups were established (“Good → Good,” “Good → Bad,” “Bad → Good,” and “Bad → Bad”) according to the change in the number of chronic diseases. Generalized estimating equation modeling analyzed the association between these changes and out-of-pocket medical cost. Out-of-pocket cost was significantly higher among older adults with multiple chronic conditions (p < 0.0001). Total out-of-pocket medical cost and out-of-pocket cost for outpatient care and prescription drugs were significantly higher for Bad→ Bad or Good → Bad changes. Older adults with cognitive decline had significantly higher total out-of-pocket medical cost and out-of-pocket cost for prescription drugs. This study demonstrates the need to improve the multiple chronic conditions management construction model to enhance the health of older adults in Korea and secure national health care finances long-term. It provides a foundation for related medical and medical expenses-related systems.",

        "Abstract": "Dolichoectasia is a form of brain large artery disease associated with a high risk of mortality and morbidity. Progressive enlargement of arterial size is a predictor of mortality, but there are no specific treatments for arresting or slowing down dilatation. Additionally, dilated brain arteries can cause flow stagnation, which can trigger thrombosis and cause stroke. Pathology and genetic studies indicate a possible role for increased matrix metalloproteinase activation in arterial dilatation and thus in the pathophysiology of dolichoectasia. Therefore, therapeutic interventions aimed at slowing down arterial dilatation and preventing thrombosis could hypothetically play a role in treating patients with dolichoectasia.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory responses in the brain play an etiological role in the development of epilepsy, suggesting that finding novel molecules for controlling neuroinflammation may have clinical value in developing the disease-modifying strategies for epileptogenesis. Adjudin, a multi-functional small molecule compound, has pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of adjudin on pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) and its role in the regulation of reactive gliosis and neuroinflammation. SE was induced in male C57BL/6 mice that were then treated with adjudin (50 mg/kg) for 3 days after SE onset. Immunofluorescence staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining, and western blot analysis were used to evaluate the effects of adjudin treatment in the hippocampus after SE. Our results showed that adjudin treatment significantly mitigated apoptotic cell death in the hippocampus after SE onset. Moreover, adjudin treatment suppressed SE-induced glial activation and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in the hippocampus. Concomitantly, adjudin treatment significantly reduced SE-induced inflammatory processes, as confirmed by changes in the expression of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and arginase-1. In conclusion, these findings suggest that adjudin may serve as a potential neuroprotective agent for preventing pathological mechanisms implicated in epileptogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Nemaline myopathies are clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders caused by several different genes. One of them is TNNT1, which was initially described in Amish families and has not been reported in Asian populations. Although most TNNT1 myopathies are caused by loss-of-function mutations, several recent studies have shown that missense mutations can also be pathogenic. A 16-year-old Korean boy with progressive muscle weakness visited the Seoul National University Hospital. He showed generalized myopathy, which was predominant in the paraspinal and neck muscles. Moreover, nemaline rods were observed in a muscle biopsy. Whole-exome sequencing of DNA samples of the patient and his younger brother, who had a similar phenotype, revealed novel compound heterozygous mutations in TNNT1 (c.724G>C (p.Ala242Pro) and c.611+1G>A). Sanger sequencing of cDNA extracted from muscle samples of the patient confirmed partial or total skipping of exon 11 in the splicing variant. The impact of the missense variant on muscle integrity and locomotor activity was verified using a zebrafish loss-of-function model. Here, we reported novel familial cases of TNNT1 myopathy with intermediate clinical presentations caused by compound heterozygous mutations and demonstrated their functional defects using an animal model.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to realize a highly capacitive/conductive electrode is an essential factor in large-scale devices, requiring a high-power/energy density system. Germanium is a feasible candidate as an anode material of lithium-ion batteries to meet the demands. However, the application is constrained due to low charge conductivity and large volume change on cycles. Here, we design a hybrid conductive shell of multi-component titanium oxide on a germanium microstructure. The shell enables facile hybrid ionic/electronic conductivity for swift charge mobility in the germanium anode, revealed through computational calculation and consecutive measurement of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Furthermore, a well-constructed electrode features a high initial Coulombic efficiency (90.6%) and stable cycle life for 800 cycles (capacity retention of 90.4%) for a fast-charging system. The stress-resilient properties of dense microparticle facilitate to alleviate structural failure toward high volumetric (up to 1737 W h L",

        "Abstract": "A dendrite-free and chemically stabilized lithium metal anode is required for extending battery life and for the application of high energy density coupled with various cathode systems. However, uneven Li metal growth and the active surface in nature accelerate electrolyte dissipation and surface corrosion, resulting in poor cycle efficiency and various safety issues. Here, the authors suggest a thin artificial interphase using a multifunctional poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-styrene) (SBS) copolymer to inhibit the electrochemical/chemical side reaction during cycling. Based on the physical features, hardness, adhesion, and flexibility, the optimized chemical structure of SBS facilitates durable mechanical strength and interphase integrity against repeated Li electrodeposition/dissolution. The effectiveness of the thin polymer film enables high cycle efficiency through the realization of a dendrite-free structure and a chemo-resistive surface of Li metal. The versatile anode demonstrates an improvement in the electrochemical properties, paired with diverse cathodes of high-capacity lithium cobalt oxide (3.5 mAh cm",

        "Abstract": "Radiation-induced cancer risks have known stochastic effects; however, regarding non-cancer diseases, evidence of risk at low radiation doses remains unclear. We aimed to identify underlying characteristics concerning non-cancer disease prevalence and determine associations with radiation dose among Korean radiation workers. Using a nationwide baseline survey, 20,608 workers were enrolled. Data concerning participant demographics, occupational characteristics, lifestyle, and lifetime prevalence of non-cancer diseases were linked to a national dose registry. We compared non-cancer disease prevalences in the Korean general population with those in this cohort and undertook a dose-response analysis concerning the cumulative dose. Hyperlipidemia (10.6%), circulatory (9.6%), and respiratory (4.1%) system diseases, followed by thyroid diseases (3.5%), had the highest prevalences, with hyperlipidemia, thyroid diseases, and hepatitis prevalence being higher in the cohort than in the general population. Radiation doses were associated with elevated prevalences of most diseases; however, associations were attenuated and not significant after adjusting for confounders, except for musculoskeletal system diseases (prevalence odds ratio [POR]/10 mSv, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.07) and cataracts (POR/10 mSv, 1.04; 95% CI 1.00-1.07). Further studies are warranted to investigate the causality of those non-cancer diseases involving more varied confounders such as physical and psychosocial stresses and ultraviolet light.",

        "Abstract": "COVID-19 presentations range from mild to moderate through severe disease but also manifest with persistent illness or viral recrudescence. We hypothesized that the spectrum of COVID-19 disease manifestations was a consequence of SARS-CoV-2-mediated delay in the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) response, including dampened type I interferon signaling, thereby shifting the balance of the immune response to be dominated by damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signaling. To test the hypothesis, we constructed a parsimonious mechanistic mathematical model. After calibration of the model for initial viral load and then by varying a few key parameters, we show that the core model generates four distinct viral load, immune response and associated disease trajectories termed \"patient archetypes\", whose temporal dynamics are reflected in clinical data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The model also accounts for responses to corticosteroid therapy and predicts that vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies and cellular memory will be protective, including from severe COVID-19 disease. This generalizable modeling framework could be used to analyze protective and pathogenic immune responses to diverse viral infections.",

        "Title": "\"Scene\" from inside: The representation of Observer's space in high-level visual cortex.",
        "Abstract": "Human observers are remarkably adept at perceiving and interacting with visual stimuli around them. Compared to visual stimuli like objects or faces, scenes are unique in that they provide enclosures for observers. An observer looks at a scene by being physically inside the scene. The current research explored this unique observer-scene relationship by studying the neural representation of scenes' spatial boundaries. Previous studies hypothesized that scenes' boundaries were processed in sets of high-level visual cortices. Notably, the parahippocampal place area (PPA), exhibited neural sensitivity to scenes that had closed vs. open spatial boundaries (Kravitz et al., 2011; Park et al., 2011). We asked whether this sensitivity reflected the openness of landscape (e.g., forest vs. beach), or the openness of the environment immediately surrounding the observer (i.e., whether a scene was viewed from inside vs. outside a room). Across two human fMRI experiments, we found that the PPA, as well as another well-known navigation-processing area, the occipital place area (OPA), processed scenes' boundaries according to the observer's space rather than the landscape. Moreover, we found that the PPA's activation pattern was susceptible to manipulations involving mid-level perceptual properties of scenes (e.g., rectilinear pattern of window frames), while the OPA's response was not. Our results have important implications for research in visual scene processing and suggest an important role of an observer's location in representing the spatial boundary, beyond the low-level visual input of a landscape.",

        "Abstract": "Defects in the PIEZO1 gene cause lymphatic dysplasia in an autosomal recessive manner, mostly by loss-of-function variants. Moreover, since 2019, the role of PIEZO1 in bone formation has been established, but there have been no PIEZO1-related cases presenting definite skeletal involvement to date. A 21-year-old male with primary lymphatic dysplasia had some other distinctive clinical features, including multiple fracture history during infancy, thoracolumbar scoliosis, short stature, and left-sided facial bone hypoplasia. We analyzed the whole exome of the patient and found two novel pathogenic variants of PIEZO1 in trans: a 93.7 kb heterozygous deletion (chr16:88,782,477-88,876,207; exon 1-50) and c.2858G>A (p.Arg953His). Sanger sequencing validated the deletion with breakpoints, and each variant was inherited from a different parent. This study presented an extremely rare case of a patient with lymphatic dysplasia caused by compound heterozygous variants of PIEZO1, along with additional clinical manifestations including several skeletal phenotypes.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of sedentary behavior and self-rated health with cardiovascular disease or cancer in elderly people. The data of 6785 elderly persons aged above 65 years from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2014-2018 were examined. Binary logistic regression analyses assessed the association of sedentary behavior, self-rated health, and other risk factors with cardiovascular disease or cancer. Prolonged sedentary behavior in elderly people was associated with a high risk for cardiovascular disease (odds ratio (OR): 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.52). There was a high risk for cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.85-3.01) or cancer (OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17-1.88) in elderly people who had poor self-rated health. This study identified the association between prolonged sedentary behavior and cardiovascular disease, and between poor self-rated health and cancer. Since prolonged sedentary behavior is related to cardiovascular disease, efforts are needed to reduce sedentary behavior hours and maintain good self-rated health.",

        "Abstract": "Despite over two decades of research on the neural mechanisms underlying human visual scene, or place, processing, it remains unknown what exactly a \"scene\" is. Intuitively, we are always inside a scene, while interacting with the outside of objects. Hence, we hypothesize that one diagnostic feature of a scene may be concavity, portraying \"inside\", and predict that if concavity is a scene-diagnostic feature, then: 1) images that depict concavity, even non-scene images (e.g., the \"inside\" of an object - or concave object), will be behaviorally categorized as scenes more often than those that depict convexity, and 2) the cortical scene-processing system will respond more to concave images than to convex images. As predicted, participants categorized concave objects as scenes more often than convex objects, and, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), two scene-selective cortical regions (the parahippocampal place area, PPA, and the occipital place area, OPA) responded significantly more to concave than convex objects. Surprisingly, we found no behavioral or neural differences between images of concave versus convex buildings. However, in a follow-up experiment, using tightly-controlled images, we unmasked a selective sensitivity to concavity over convexity of scene boundaries (i.e., walls) in PPA and OPA. Furthermore, we found that even highly impoverished line drawings of concave shapes are behaviorally categorized as scenes more often than convex shapes. Together, these results provide converging behavioral and neural evidence that concavity is a diagnostic feature of visual scenes.",

        "Title": "Increased Incidence of Thyroid Cancer in Occupational Radiation Epidemiology: Attribution to Screening among Radiation Workers.",
        "Abstract": "In most studies on radiation workers, the incidence of thyroid cancer was determined to be higher than among the general population; this is generally assumed to be due to overdiagnosis through thyroid screening. However, there is a lack of evidence on the association between thyroid screening and increased thyroid cancer incidence in most occupational studies. In this study, we compared thyroid cancer screening rates between the general population and radiation workers with various occupations and examined the relationship between these rates and thyroid cancer incidence. We compared thyroid screening rates between radiation workers and the general population with age- and sex-standardized screening ratios (SSRs) using data from two national surveys conducted during 2015-2017 in Korea, and assessed the correlation between these ratios and age- and sex-standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for thyroid cancer. Screening rates were higher among radiation workers than among the general population, with an overall SSR of 1.58 (95% confidence interval: 1.54-1.62). When various types of occupations were compared, those with an increased SSR also had an increased SIR. SSRs remained high even when the screening period was restricted to the year preceding the survey (the year after the establishment of guidelines for thyroid cancer screening aimed at reducing overdiagnosis). In conclusion, the increased incidence of thyroid cancer among radiation workers compared to that among the general population can be attributed mainly to increased thyroid screening rates. Additional efforts are needed to reduce unnecessary thyroid cancer screening in occupational populations, particularly in those with better access to healthcare, in terms of clinical rationale and for assessing the true increase in thyroid cancer incidence.",

        "Title": "What predicts legislative success of early care and education policies?: Applications of machine learning and Natural Language Processing in a cross-state early childhood policy analysis.",
        "Abstract": "Following the pioneering efforts of a federal Head Start program, U.S. state policymakers have rapidly expanded access to Early Care and Education (ECE) programs with strong bipartisan support. Within the past decade the enrollment of 4 year-olds has roughly doubled in state-funded preschool. Despite these public investments, the content and priorities of early childhood legislation-enacted and failed-have rarely been examined. This study integrates perspectives from public policy, political science, developmental science, and machine learning in examining state ECE bills in identifying key factors associated with legislative success. Drawing from the Early Care and Education Bill Tracking Database, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a statistical topic identification model, to examine 2,396 ECE bills across the 50 U.S. states during the 2015-2018. First, a six-topic solution demonstrated the strongest fit theoretically and empirically suggesting two meta policy priorities: 'ECE finance' and 'ECE services'. 'ECE finance' comprised three dimensions: (1) Revenues, (2) Expenditures, and (3) Fiscal Governance. 'ECE services' also included three dimensions: (1) PreK, (2) Child Care, and (3) Health and Human Services (HHS). Further, we found that bills covering a higher proportion of HHS, Fiscal Governance, or Expenditures were more likely to pass into law relative to bills focusing largely on PreK, Child Care, and Revenues. Additionally, legislative effectiveness of the bill's primary sponsor was a strong predictor of legislative success, and further moderated the relation between bill content and passage. Highly effective legislators who had previously passed five or more bills had an extremely high probability of introducing a legislation that successfully passed regardless of topic. Legislation with expenditures as policy priorities benefitted the most from having an effective legislator. We conclude with a discussion of the empirical findings within the broader context of early childhood policy literature and suggest implications for future research and policy.",

Black adults, particularly Black women, are less likely to achieve ideal CVH.

        "Abstract": "As the world population continues to increase to unsustainable levels, the importance of birth control and the development of new contraceptives are emerging. To date, male contraceptive options have been lagging behind those available to women, and those few options available are not satisfactory to everyone. To solve this problem, we have been searching for new candidate target proteins for non-hormonal contraceptives. Testis-specific proteins are appealing targets for male contraceptives because they are more likely to be involved in male reproduction and their targeting by small molecules is predicted to have no on-target harmful effects on other organs. Using in silico analysis, we identified Erich2, Glt6d1, Prss58, Slfnl1, Sppl2c, Stpg3, Tex33, and Tex36 as testis-abundant genes in both mouse and human. The genes, 4930402F06Rik and 4930568D16Rik, are testis-abundant paralogs of Glt6d1 that we also discovered in mice but not in human, and were also included in our studies to eliminate the potential compensation. We generated knockout (KO) mouse lines of all listed genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Analysis of all of the individual KO mouse lines as well as Glt6d1/4930402F06Rik/4930568D16Rik TKO mouse lines revealed that they are male fertile with no observable defects in reproductive organs, suggesting that these 10 genes are not required for male fertility nor play redundant roles in the case of the 3 Glt6D1 paralogs. Further studies are needed to uncover protein function(s), but in vivo functional screening using the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a fast and accurate way to find genes essential for male fertility, which may apply to studies of genes expressed elsewhere. In this study, although we could not find any potential protein targets for non-hormonal male contraceptives, our findings help to streamline efforts to find and focus on only the essential genes.",

        "Abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency with high mortality and a risk factor for the development of chronic epilepsy. Given that effective treatments for the pathophysiology following SE are still lacking, suppressing pathophysiological mechanisms of SE may be important to inhibit epileptogenesis. Withanolide-A (WA), a major bioactive component of Withania somnifera, is a potential medicinal natural compound showing improvement of some neurological diseases, such as cerebral ischemia. In the present study, we examined whether administration of WA can exert the beneficial effects involved in neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory effects in a mouse model of pilocarpine-induced SE. Our results showed that WA treatment ameliorated SE-induced apoptotic neuronal cell death in the hippocampus. Moreover, WA treatment reduced immunoreactivity of both ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1-positive microglia/macrophage and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive reactive astrocytes, and the SE-induced increase in both interleukin-1 β and tumor necrosis factor in the hippocampus, suggesting that inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors by WA treatment might induce neuroprotection after SE. These results suggest that WA may be useful in improving the treatment efficacy for pathophysiology following SE.",

Doses below recording level (≤0.1 mSv) were reported in 7901 (38.3%) cases; 431 (2%) had cumulative doses ≥100 mSv. From 1999-2016, 212 cancers (189 men, 23 women) occurred; thyroid cancer predominated (39.2%, 72 men, 11 women). In men, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for all cancers was significantly decreased (SIR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.88); however, that for thyroid cancer was significantly increased (SIR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.54-2.44). Compared to the non-exposed group (≤0.1 mSv), the relative risk (RR) in the exposed group (>0.1 mSv) after adjusting for sex, attained age, smoking status, and duration of employment was 0.82 (95% CI 0.60-1.12) for all cancers and 0.83 (95% CI 0.49-1.83) for thyroid cancer. The preliminary findings from this baseline study with a shorter follow-up than the latency period for solid cancer cannot exclude possible associations between radiation doses and cancer risk.",

        "Abstract": "For visually guided navigation, the use of environmental cues is essential. Particularly, detecting local boundaries that impose limits to locomotion and estimating their location is crucial. In a series of three fMRI experiments, we investigated whether there is a neural coding of navigational distance in the human visual cortex (both female and male). We used virtual reality software to systematically manipulate the distance from a viewer perspective to different types of a boundary. Using a multivoxel pattern classification employing a linear support vector machine, we found that the occipital place area (OPA) is sensitive to the navigational distance restricted by the transparent glass wall. Further, the OPA was sensitive to a non-crossable boundary only, suggesting an importance of the functional constraint of a boundary. Together, we propose the OPA as a perceptual source of external environmental features relevant for navigation.",

        "Abstract": "A substantial portion of Mendelian disease patients suffers from genetic variants that are inherited in a recessive manner. A precise understanding of pathogenic recessive variants in a population would assist in pre-screening births of such patients. However, a systematic understanding of the contribution of recessive variants to Mendelian diseases is still lacking. Therefore, genetic diagnosis and variant discovery of 553 undiagnosed Korean patients with complex neurodevelopmental problems (KND for Korean NeuroDevelopmental cohort) were performed using whole exome sequencing of patients and their parents. Disease-causing variants, including newly discovered variants, were identified in 57.5% of the probands of the KND cohort. Among the patients with the previous reported pathogenic variants, 35.1% inherited these variants in a recessive manner. Genes that cause recessive disorders in our cohort tend to be less constrained by loss-of-function variants and were enriched in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial functions. This observation was applied to an estimation that approximately 1 in 17 healthy Korean individuals carry at least one of these pathogenic variants that develop severe neurodevelopmental problems in a recessive manner. Furthermore, the feasibility of these genes for carrier screening was evaluated. Our results will serve as a foundation for recessive variant screening to reduce occurrences of rare Mendelian disease patients. Additionally, our results highlight the utility and necessity of whole exome sequencing-based diagnostics for improving patient care in a country with a centralized medical system.",

        "Title": "Impaired behavioral and neural representation of scenes in Williams syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Boundaries are crucial to our representation of the geometric shape of scenes, which can be used to reorient in space. Behavioral research has shown that children and adults share exquisite sensitivity to a defining feature of a boundary: its vertical extent. Imaging studies have shown that this boundary property is represented in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) among typically developed (TD) adults. Here, we show that sensitivity to the vertical extent of scene boundaries is impaired at both the behavioral and neural level in people with Williams syndrome (WS), a genetic deficit that results in severely impaired spatial functions. Behavioral reorientation was tested in three boundary conditions: a flat Mat, a 5 cm high Curb, and full Walls. Adults with WS could reorient in a rectangular space defined by Wall boundaries, but not Curb or Mat boundaries. In contrast, TD age-matched controls could reorient by all three boundary types and TD 4-year-olds could reorient by either Wall or Curb boundaries. Using fMRI, we find that the WS behavioral deficit is echoed in their neural representation of boundaries. While TD age-matched controls showed distinct neural responses to scenes depicting Mat, Curb, and Wall boundaries in the PPA, people with WS showed only a distinction between the Wall and Mat or Curb, but no distinction between the Mat and Curb. Taken together, these results reveal a close coupling between the representation of boundaries as they are used in behavioral reorientation and neural encoding, suggesting that damage to this key element of spatial representation may have a genetic foundation.",

        "Abstract": "The middleware framework for IoT collaboration services should provide efficient solutions to context awareness and uncertainty issues among multiple collaboration domains. However, existing middleware frameworks are mostly limited to a single system, and developing self-adaptive IoT collaboration services using existing frameworks requires developers to take considerable time and effort. Furthermore, the developed IoT collaboration services are often dependent on a particular domain, which cannot easily be referenced in other domains. This paper proposes a cloud-based middleware framework that provides a set of cloud services for self-adaptive IoT collaboration services. The proposed middleware framework is generic in the sense that it clearly separates domain-dependent components from the layers that leverage existing middleware frameworks. In addition, the proposed framework allows developers to upload domain-dependent components onto the cloud, search for registered components, and launch Virtual Machine (VM) running a new MAPE cycle via a convenient web-based interface. The feasibility of the proposed framework has been shown with a simulation of an IoT collaboration service that traces a criminal suspect. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed middleware framework runs with an overhead of only 6% compared to pure Java-based middleware and is scalable as the number of VMs increases up to 16.",

        "Abstract": "Neuraminidase is the second major surface antigen on influenza virus. We investigated the immunogenicity and cross protective efficacy of virus-like particle containing neuraminidase derived from 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (N1 VLP) in comparison with inactivated split influenza vaccine. Immunization of mice with N1 VLP induced antibody responses specific for virus and cross-reactive neuraminidase inhibition activity whereas an inactivated split vaccine induced strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition activity. N1 VLP-immunized mice developed cross protective immunity against antigenically different influenza viruses, as determined by body weight changes, lung viral titers, infiltrating innate immune cells, and cytokines, and antibody secreting cells, and germinal center B cells. Also, N1 VLP-immune sera provided cross-protection in naïve mice. Immunity by N1 VLP vaccination was not compromised in Fc receptor γ-chain deficient mice. These results suggest that neuraminidase-presenting VLP can be developed as an effective cross-protective vaccine candidate along with current influenza vaccination.",

        "Abstract": "Alloys are recently receiving considerable attention in the community of rechargeable batteries as possible alternatives to carbonaceous negative electrodes; however, challenges remain for the practical utilization of these materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of germanium-zinc alloy nanofibers through electrospinning and a subsequent calcination step. Evidenced by in situ transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterizations, this one-dimensional design possesses unique structures. Both germanium and zinc atoms are homogenously distributed allowing for outstanding electronic conductivity and high available capacity for lithium storage. The as-prepared materials present high rate capability (capacity of ~ 50% at 20 C compared to that at 0.2 C-rate) and cycle retention (73% at 3.0 C-rate) with a retaining capacity of 546 mAh g",

        "Abstract": "A fast-charging battery that supplies maximum energy is a key element for vehicle electrification. High-capacity silicon anodes offer a viable alternative to carbonaceous materials, but they are vulnerable to fracture due to large volumetric changes during charge-discharge cycles. The low ionic and electronic transport across the silicon particles limits the charging rate of batteries. Here, as a three-in-one solution for the above issues, we show that small amounts of sulfur doping (<1 at%) render quasi-metallic silicon microparticles by substitutional doping and increase lithium ion conductivity through the flexible and robust self-supporting channels as demonstrated by microscopy observation and theoretical calculations. Such unusual doping characters are enabled by the simultaneous bottom-up assembly of dopants and silicon at the seed level in molten salts medium. This sulfur-doped silicon anode shows highly stable battery cycling at a fast-charging rate with a high energy density beyond those of a commercial standard anode.",

        "Abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) causes acute and chronic lung toxicities at occupational exposure levels, yet the impacts of Cd exposure at low levels through dietary intake remain largely uncharacterized. Health concerns arise because humans do not have an effective Cd elimination mechanism, resulting in a long (10- to 35-y) biological half-life. Previous studies showed increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and cell death by Cd yet the details of mitochondrial alterations by low levels of Cd remain unexplored. In the current study, we examined the impacts of Cd burden at a low environmental level on lung metabolome, redox proteome, and inflammation in mice given Cd at low levels by drinking water (0, 0.2, 0.6 and 2.0 mg Cd/L) for 16 weeks. The results showed that mice accumulated lung Cd comparable to non-smoking humans and showed inflammation in lung by histopathology at 2 mg Cd/L. The results of high resolution metabolomics combined with bioinformatics showed that mice treated with 2 mg Cd/L increased levels of lipids in the lung, accompanied by disruption in mitochondrial energy metabolism. In addition, targeted metabolomic analysis showed that these mice had increased accumulation of mitochondrial carnitine and citric acid cycle intermediates. The results of redox proteomics showed that Cd at 2 mg/L stimulated oxidation of isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and ATP synthase. Taken together, the results showed impaired mitochondrial function and accumulation of lipids in the lung with a Cd dose response relevant to non-smokers without occupational exposures. These findings suggest that dietary Cd intake could be an important variable contributing to human pulmonary disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Intramuscular (IM) vaccination with formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (FI-RSV) failed in clinical trials due to vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease. To test the efficacy of skin vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), we investigated the immunogenicity, efficacy, and inflammatory disease after microneedle (MN) patch delivery of FI-RSV vaccine (FI-RSV MN) to the mouse skin with or without an adjuvant of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Compared to IM vaccination, MN patch delivery of FI-RSV was more effective in clearing lung viral loads and preventing weight loss, and in diminishing inflammation, infiltrating immune cells, and T helper type 2 (Th2) CD4 T cell responses after RSV challenge. With MPL adjuvant, MN patch delivery of FI-RSV significantly increased the immunogenicity and efficacy as well as preventing RSV disease as evidenced by lung viral clearance and avoiding pulmonary histopathology. Improved efficacy and prevention of disease by FI-RSV MN with MPL were correlated with no sign of airway resistance, lower levels of Th2 cytokines and infiltrating innate inflammatory cells, and higher levels of Th1 T cell responses into the lung. This study suggests that MN patch delivery of RSV vaccines to the skin with MPL adjuvant would be a promising vaccination method.",

        "Abstract": "Starting with the Internet of Things (IoT), new forms of system operation concepts have emerged to provide creative services through collaborations among autonomic devices. Following these paradigmatic changes, the ability of each participating system to automatically diagnose the degree of quality it is providing is inevitable. This paper proposed a method to automatically detect symptoms that hinder certain quality attributes. The method consisted of three steps: (1) extracting information from real usage logs and automatically generating an activity model from the captured information; (2) merging multiple user activity models into a single, representative model; and (3) detecting differences between the representative user activity model, and an expected activity model. The proposed method was implemented in a domain-independent framework, workable on the Android platform. Unlike other related works, we used quantitative evaluation results to show the benefits of applying the proposed method to five Android-based, open-source mobile applications. The evaluation results showed that the average precision rate for the automatic detection of symptoms was 70%, and the success rate for user implementation of usage scenarios demonstrated an improvement of around 21%, when the automatically detected symptoms were resolved.",

        "Abstract": "Nanowires (NWs) synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have demonstrated significant improvement in lithium storage performance along with their outstanding accommodation of large volume changes during the charge/discharge process. Nevertheless, NW electrodes have been confined to the research level due to the lack of scalability and severe side reactions by their high surface area. Here, we present nanoporous Ge nanofibers (NPGeNFs) having moderate nanoporosity via a combination of simple electrospinning and a low-energetic zincothermic reduction reaction. In contrast with the CVD-assisted NW growth, our method provides high tunability of macro/microscopic morphologies such as a porosity, length, and diameter of the nanoscale 1D structures. Significantly, the customized NPGeNFs showed a highly suppressed volume expansion of less than 15% (for electrodes) after full lithation and excellent durability with high lithium storage performance over 500 cycles. Our approach offers effective 1D nanostructuring with highly customized geometries and can be extended to other applications including optoelectronics, catalysis, and energy conversion.",

However, the large volume change of silicon upon lithiation/delithiation poses a critical challenge for stable battery operations. Here, we introduce an unprecedented design, which takes advantage of large deformation and ensures the structural stability of the material by developing a two-dimensional silicon nanosheet coated with a thin carbon layer. During electrochemical cycling, this carbon coated silicon nanosheet exhibits unique deformation patterns, featuring accommodation of deformation in the thickness direction upon lithiation, while forming ripples upon delithiation, as demonstrated by in situ transmission electron microscopy observation and chemomechanical simulation. The ripple formation presents a unique mechanism for releasing the cycling induced stress, rendering the electrode much more stable and durable than the uncoated counterparts. This work demonstrates a general principle as how to take the advantage of the large deformation materials for designing high capacity electrode.",

        "Abstract": "As human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common cause of disease in newborns and transplant recipients, developing an HCMV vaccine is considered a major public health priority. Yet an HCMV vaccine candidate remains elusive. Although the precise HCMV immune correlates of protection are unclear, both humoral and cellular immune responses have been implicated in protection against HCMV infection and disease. Here we describe a vaccine approach based on the well-characterized modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector to stimulate robust HCMV humoral and cellular immune responses by an antigen combination composed of the envelope pentamer complex (PC), glycoprotein B (gB), and phosphoprotein 65 (pp65). We show that in mice, multiantigenic MVA vaccine vectors simultaneously expressing all five PC subunits, gB, and pp65 elicit potent complement-independent and complement-dependent HCMV neutralizing antibodies as well as mouse and human MHC-restricted, polyfunctional T cell responses by the individual antigens. In addition, we demonstrate that the PC/gB antigen combination of these multiantigenic MVA vectors can enhance the stimulation of humoral immune responses that mediate ",

Models were trained on 80%, while 20% were set aside for validation testing. Baseline information and standard grading scales were evaluated: age, sex, Hunt Hess grade, modified Fisher Scale (mFS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). An unsupervised approach applying random kernels was used to extract features from physiological time series (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation). Classifiers (Partial Least Squares, linear and kernel Support Vector Machines) were trained on feature subsets of the derivation dataset. Models were applied to the validation dataset. The performances of the best classifiers on the validation dataset are reported by feature subset. Standard grading scale (mFS): AUC 0.58. Combined demographics and grading scales: AUC 0.60. Random kernel derived physiologic features: AUC 0.74. Combined baseline and physiologic features with redundant feature reduction: AUC 0.77. Current DCI prediction tools rely on admission imaging and are advantageously simple to employ. However, using an agnostic and computationally inexpensive learning approach for high-frequency physiologic time series data, we demonstrated that our models achieve higher classification accuracy.",

        "Abstract": "Randomized experiments are often complicated because of treatment noncompliance. This challenge prevents researchers from identifying the mediated portion of the intention-to-treated (ITT) effect, which is the effect of the assigned treatment that is attributed to a mediator. One solution suggests identifying the mediated ITT effect on the basis of the average causal mediation effect among compliers when there is a single mediator. However, considering the complex nature of the mediating mechanisms, it is natural to assume that there are multiple variables that mediate through the causal path. Motivated by an empirical analysis of a data set collected in a randomized interventional study, we develop a method to estimate the mediated portion of the ITT effect when both multiple dependent mediators and treatment noncompliance exist. This enables researchers to make an informed decision on how to strengthen the intervention effect by identifying relevant mediators despite treatment noncompliance. We propose a nonparametric estimation procedure and provide a sensitivity analysis for key assumptions. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed approach. The proposed method is illustrated by an empirical analysis of JOBS II data, in which a job training intervention was used to prevent mental health deterioration among unemployed individuals.",

        "Abstract": "Considering that causal mechanisms unfold over time, it is important to investigate the mechanisms over time, taking into account the time-varying features of treatments and mediators. However, identification of the average causal mediation effect in the presence of time-varying treatments and mediators is often complicated by time-varying confounding. This article aims to provide a novel approach to uncovering causal mechanisms in time-varying treatments and mediators in the presence of time-varying confounding. We provide different strategies for identification and sensitivity analysis under homogeneous and heterogeneous effects. Homogeneous effects are those in which each individual experiences the same effect, and heterogeneous effects are those in which the effects vary over individuals. Most importantly, we provide an alternative definition of average causal mediation effects that evaluates a partial mediation effect; the effect that is mediated by paths other than through an intermediate confounding variable. We argue that this alternative definition allows us to better assess at least a part of the mediated effect and provides meaningful and unique interpretations. A case study using ECLS-K data that evaluates kindergarten retention policy is offered to illustrate our proposed approach.",

        "Abstract": "With the emergence of various forms of smart devices and new paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) concept, the IT (Information Technology) service areas are expanding explosively compared to the provision of services by single systems. A new system operation concept that has emerged in accordance with such technical trends is the IT ecosystem. The IT ecosystem can be considered a special type of system of systems in which multiple systems with various degrees of autonomy achieve common goals while adapting to the given environment. The single systems that participate in the IT ecosystem adapt autonomously to the current situation based on collected data from sensors. Furthermore, to maintain the services supported by the whole IT ecosystem sustainably, the configuration of single systems that participate in the IT ecosystem also changes appropriately in accordance with the changed situation. In order to support the IT ecosystem, this paper proposes an architecture framework that supports dynamic configuration changes to achieve the goal of the whole IT ecosystem, while ensuring the autonomy of single systems through the collection of data from sensors so as to recognize the situational context of individual participating systems. For the feasibility evaluation of the proposed framework, a simulated example of an IT ecosystem for unmanned forest management was constructed, and the quantitative evaluation results are discussed in terms of the extent to which the proposed architecture framework can continuously provide sustainable services in response to diverse environmental context changes.",

Reduced platelet function after the initial bleed is associated with higher risk of early rebleeding. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a well-known hemostatic agent, and recent guidelines already suggest its use in individuals exposed to antiplatelet drugs. The authors hypothesized that DDAVP administration in patients with SAH at admission would be associated with lower risks of rebleeding.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that adults are able to remember more than 1,000 images with great detail. However, little is known about the development of this visual capacity, nor its presence early in life. This study tests the level of detail of young children's memory for a large number of items, adapting the method of Brady, Konkle, Alvarez, and Oliva (2008). Four- and six-year-old children were shown more than 100 images of everyday objects. They were then tested for recognition of familiar items in a binary decision task. The identity of the foil test item was manipulated in three conditions (Category, Exemplar, and State). Children demonstrated high accuracy across all conditions, remembering not only the basic-level category (Category), but also unique details (Exemplar), and information about position and arrangement of parts (State). These findings demonstrate that children spontaneously encode a high degree of visual detail. Early in life, visual memory exhibits high fidelity and extends over a large set of items.",

Prevention of vasospasm-induced delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage depends on optimization of cerebral perfusion pressure, which can be challenged by neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy.

Aβ has been widely used to mimic several aspects of Alzheimer's disease. However, several characteristics of amyloid-induced Alzheimer's disease pathology are not well established, especially in mice. The present study aimed to develop a new Alzheimer's disease model by investigating how Aβ can be effectively aggregated using prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To express the Aβ42 complex in HEK293 cells, we cloned the Aβ42 region in a tandem repeat and incorporated the resulting construct into a eukaryotic expression vector. Following transfection into HEK293 cells via lipofection, cell viability assay and western blotting analysis revealed that exogenous Aβ42 can induce cell death and apoptosis. In addition, recombinant His-tagged Aβ42 was successfully expressed in ",

        "Abstract": "Texture provides crucial information about the category or identity of a scene. Nonetheless, not much is known about how the texture information in a scene is represented in the brain. Previous studies have shown that the parahippocampal place area (PPA), a scene-selective part of visual cortex, responds to simple patches of texture ensemble. However, in natural scenes textures exist in spatial context within a scene. Here we tested two hypotheses that make different predictions on how textures within a scene context are represented in the PPA. The Texture-Only hypothesis suggests that the PPA represents texture ensemble (i.e., the kind of texture) as is, irrespective of its location in the scene. On the other hand, the Texture and Location hypothesis suggests that the PPA represents texture and its location within a scene (e.g., ceiling or wall) conjointly. We tested these two hypotheses across two experiments, using different but complementary methods. In ",

        "Abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) hyperporous silicon flakes (HPSFs) are prepared via the chemical reduction of natural clay minerals bearing metal oxides. Natural clays generally have 2D flake-like structures with broad size distributions in the lateral dimension and varied thicknesses depending on the first processing condition from nature. They have repeating layers of silicate and metal oxides in various ratios. When the clay mineral is subjected to a reduction reaction, metal oxide layers can perform a negative catalyst for absorbing large amounts of exothermic heat from the reduction reaction of the silicate layers with metal reductant. Selectively etching out metal oxides shows a hyperporous nanoflake structure containing 100 nm macropores and meso-/micropores on its framework. The resultant HPSFs are demonstrated as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Compared to conventional micro-Si anodes, HPSFs exhibit exceptionally high initial Coulombic efficiency over 92%. Furthermore, HPSF anodes show outstanding cycling performance (reversible capacity of 1619 mAh g",

        "Abstract": "The growing volume of clinical data in modern medical practice creates difficulties for clinicians when attempting to come to a full understanding of each patient's overall health status. Many different approaches to computer-based visualizations have been taken in an attempt to alleviate this burden; however, no single approach has been widely adopted. As a step towards optimization and standardization of data visualization in healthcare, this paper presents a diverse set of approaches to visualization for multiple organ systems. To do so we summarize best practices in design and evaluation while proposing usability testing methodology. We then review and illustrate the goals of various clinical data visualization techniques.",

        "Title": "Adenovirus-mediated Foxp3 expression in lung epithelial cells reduces airway inflammation in ovalbumin and cockroach-induced asthma model.",
        "Abstract": "Foxp3 is a master regulator of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T-cell (Treg) function and is also a suppressor of SKP2 and HER2/ErbB2. There are an increasing number of reports describing the functions of Foxp3 in cell types other than Tregs. In this context, we evaluated the functions of Foxp3 in ovalbumin- and cockroach-induced asthma models. Foxp3-EGFP-expressing adenovirus or EGFP control adenovirus was administered intratracheally (i.t.), followed by challenge with ovalbumin (OVA) or cockroach extract to induce asthma. Th2 cytokine and immune cell profiles of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), as well as serum IgE levels, were analyzed. Histological analyses were also conducted to demonstrate the effects of Foxp3 expression on airway remodeling, goblet cell hyperplasia and inflammatory responses in the lung. Adenoviral Foxp3 was expressed only in lung epithelial cells, and not in CD4(+) or CD8(+) cells. BALF from Foxp3 gene-delivered mice showed significantly reduced numbers of total immune cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes in response to cockroach allergen or OVA. In addition, Foxp3 expression in the lung reduced the levels of Th2 cytokines and IgE in BALF and serum, respectively. Moreover, histopathological analysis also showed that Foxp3 expression substantially inhibited eosinophil infiltration into the airways, goblet cell hyperplasia and smooth muscle cell hypertrophy. Furthermore, when Tregs were depleted by diphtheria toxin in Foxp3(DTR) mice, the anti-asthmatic functions of Foxp3 were not altered in OVA-challenged asthma models. In this study, our results suggest that Foxp3 expression in lung epithelial cells, and not in Tregs, inhibited OVA- and cockroach extract-induced asthma.",

Using potential outcomes notation, we show that same-age and same-grade comparisons refer to different retention-promotion contrasts and therefore assess different causal questions. We also comment on deleting versus censoring records of students who dropped out of the study or do not belong to the treatment regimes under investigation. Whereas deleting entire student records potentially induces collider bias, censoring circumvents bias if censoring is ignorable given the observed pretreatment covariates.",

        "Title": "Determination of Optimal Harvest Time of Chuchung Variety Green Rice(®) (Oryza sativa L.) with High Contents of GABA, γ-Oryzanol, and α-Tocopherol.",
        "Abstract": "In our previous study, an early-maturing variety of rice (Oryza sativa L.), Jinbu can have feature with unique green color, various phytochemicals as well as nutritive components by the optimal early harvesting, called Green Rice(®) (GR). The aims of the present field experiments were to evaluate the changes in the weight of 1,000 kernels, yield, and contents of proximate and bioactive compounds in Chuchung, a mid-late maturing variety, during the pre-harvest maturation of rough rice and to research the appropriate harvest time and potent bioactivity of Chuchung GR. The weights of 1,000 kernels of Chuchung GR dramatically increased until 27 days after heading (DAH). The yields of Chuchung GR declined after 27 DAH and significantly declined to 0.0% after 45 DAH. The caloric value and total mineral contents were higher in the GR than in the full ripe stage, the brown rice (BR). In the GR, the contents of bioactive compounds, such as γ-aminobutyric acid, γ-oryzanol, and α-tocopherol, were much higher (P<0.05) than those in the BR, specifically during 24~27 DAH. Therefore, bioactive Chuchung GR can be produced with a reasonable yield at 24~27 DAH and it could be useful for applications in various nutritive and functional food products.",

        "Title": "Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Pomegranate Peel Extract in THP-1 Cells Exposed to Particulate Matter PM10.",
        "Abstract": "Epidemiological and experimental evidence support health risks associated with the exposure to airborne particulate matter with a diameter of <10 μM (PM10). PM10 stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory mediators. Thus, we assumed that natural antioxidants might provide health benefits attenuating hazardous effects of PM10. In the present study, we examined the effects of pomegranate peel extract (PPE) on THP-1 monocytic cells exposed to PM10. PM10 induced cytotoxicity and the production of ROS. It also increased the expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and cell adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). PPE at 10-100 μg mL(-1) attenuated the production of ROS and the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, and ICAM-1, but not VCAM-1, in THP-1 cells stimulated by PM10 (100 μg mL(-1)). PPE also attenuated the adhesion of PM10-stimulated THP-1 cells to EA.hy926 endothelial cells. PPE constituents, punicalagin and ellagic acid, attenuated PM10-induced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, and punicalagin was less cytotoxic compared to ellagic acid. The present study suggests that PPE and punicalagin may be useful in alleviating inflammatory reactions due to particulate matter.",

        "Title": "Neural representation of object orientation: A dissociation between MVPA and Repetition Suppression.",
        "Abstract": "How is object orientation represented in the brain? Behavioral error patterns reveal systematic tendencies to confuse certain orientations with one another. Using fMRI, we asked whether more confusable orientations are represented more similarly in object selective cortex (LOC). We compared two widely-used measures of neural similarity: multi-voxel pattern similarity (MVP-similarity) and Repetition Suppression. In LO, we found that multi-voxel pattern similarity was predicted by the confusability of two orientations. By contrast, Repetition Suppression effects in LO were unrelated to the confusability of orientations. To account for these differences between MVP-similarity and Repetition Suppression, we propose that MVP-similarity reflects the topographical distribution of neural populations, whereas Repetition Suppression depends on repeated activation of particular groups of neurons. This hypothesis leads to a unified interpretation of our results and may explain other dissociations between MVPA and Repetition Suppression observed in the literature.",
