        "Abstract": "Several decades of heterochronic parabiosis (HCPB) studies have demonstrated the restorative impact of young blood, and deleterious influence of aged blood, on physiological function and homeostasis across tissues, although few of the factors responsible for these observations have been identified. Here we develop an in vitro HCPB system to identify these circulating factors, using replicative lifespan (RLS) of primary human fibroblasts as an endpoint of cellular health. We find that RLS is inversely correlated with serum donor age and sensitive to the presence or absence of specific serum components. Through in vitro HCPB, we identify the secreted protein pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) as a circulating factor that extends RLS of primary human fibroblasts and declines with age in mammals. Systemic administration of PEDF to aged mice reverses age-related functional decline and pathology across several tissues, improving cognitive function and reducing hepatic fibrosis and renal lipid accumulation. Together, our data supports PEDF as a systemic mediator of the effect of young blood on organismal health and homeostasis and establishes our in vitro HCPB system as a valuable screening platform for the identification of candidate circulating factors involved in aging and rejuvenation.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered over 75 genomic loci associated with risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), but identification of the underlying causal genes remains challenging. Studies of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from LOAD patients have demonstrated the existence of neuronal cell-intrinsic functional defects. Here, we searched for genetic contributions to neuronal dysfunction in LOAD using an integrative systems approach that incorporated multi-evidence-based gene mapping and network-analysis-based prioritization. A systematic perturbation screening of candidate risk genes in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) revealed that neuronal knockdown of the LOAD risk gene orthologs vha-10 (ATP6V1G2), cmd-1 (CALM3), amph-1 (BIN1), ephx-1 (NGEF), and pho-5 (ACP2) alters short-/intermediate-term memory function, the cognitive domain affected earliest during LOAD progression. These results highlight the impact of LOAD risk genes on evolutionarily conserved memory function, as mediated through neuronal endosomal dysfunction, and identify new targets for further mechanistic interrogation.",

        "Abstract": "Muscle aging is a complex physiological process that leads to the progressive decline in muscle mass and function, contributing to debilitating conditions in the elderly such as sarcopenia. In recent years, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been increasingly recognized as major regulators of muscle aging and related cellular processes. Here, we comprehensively review the emerging role of ncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), in the regulation of muscle aging. We also discuss how targeting these ncRNAs can be explored for the development of novel interventions to combat age-related muscle decline. The insights provided in this review offer a promising avenue for future research and therapeutic strategies aimed at improving muscle health during aging.",

Here, we report two 3C-derived methods, Tri-4C and Tri-HiC, which utilize multirestriction enzyme digestions for ultrafine mapping of targeted and genome-wide chromatin interaction, respectively, at up to one hundred basepair resolution. Tri-4C identified CRE loop interaction networks and quantitatively revealed their alterations underlying dynamic gene control. Tri-HiC uncovered global fine-gauge regulatory interaction networks, identifying >20-fold more enhancer:promoter (E:P) loops than in situ Hi-C. In addition to vastly improved identification of subkilobase-sized E:P loops, Tri-HiC also uncovered interaction stripes and contact domain insulation from promoters and enhancers, revealing their loop extrusion behaviors resembling the topologically associating domain boundaries. Tri-4C and Tri-HiC provide robust approaches to achieve the high-resolution interactome maps required for characterizing fine-gauge regulatory chromatin interactions in analysis of development, homeostasis, and disease.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have pinpointed the chromosomal locus 9p21.3 as a genetic hotspot for various age-related disorders. Common genetic variants in this locus are linked to multiple traits, including coronary artery diseases, cancers, and diabetes. Centenarians are known for their reduced risk and delayed onset of these conditions. To investigate whether this evasion of disease risks involves diminished genetic risks in the 9p21.3 locus, we sequenced this region in an Ashkenazi Jewish centenarian cohort (centenarians: n = 450, healthy controls: n = 500). Risk alleles associated with cancers, glaucoma, CAD, and T2D showed a significant depletion in centenarians. Furthermore, the risk and non-risk genotypes are linked to two distinct low-frequency variant profiles, enriched in controls and centenarians, respectively. Our findings provide evidence that the extreme longevity cohort is associated with collectively lower risks of multiple age-related diseases in the 9p21.3 locus.",

        "Abstract": "Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, with advanced age being the single most significant risk factor. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between aging and glaucoma remain unclear. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic variants strongly associated with increased glaucoma risk.

By employing computational and experimental methods, we demonstrated that rs6475604 resides in a repressive regulatory element.

The precise mechanisms through which mitochondria impact human lifespan, however, remain unclear. We hypothesize that humans with exceptional longevity harbor rare variants in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (mitonuclear genes) that confer resistance against age-related mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we report an integrated functional genomics study to identify rare functional variants in ~ 660 mitonuclear candidate genes discovered by target capture sequencing analysis of 496 centenarians and 572 controls of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. We identify and prioritize longevity-associated variants, genes, and mitochondrial pathways that are enriched with rare variants. We provide functional gene variants such as those in MTOR (Y2396Lfs*29), CPS1 (T1406N), and MFN2 (G548*) as well as LRPPRC (S1378G) that is predicted to affect mitochondrial translation. Taken together, our results suggest a functional role for specific mitonuclear genes and pathways in human longevity.",

Despite clear sex differences in aging, the impact of pregnancy and its complications, such as preeclampsia, on aging is an underexplored area of geroscience. This review summarizes our current knowledge about the complex links between pregnancy and age-related diseases, including evidence from epidemiology, clinical research, and genetics. We discuss the relationship between normal and pathological pregnancy and maternal aging, using preeclampsia as a primary example. We review the results of human genetics studies of preeclampsia, including genome wide association studies (GWAS), and attempted to catalog genes involved in preeclampsia as a gateway to mechanisms underlying an increased risk of later life cardio- and neuro- vascular events. Lastly, we discuss challenges in interpreting the GWAS of preeclampsia and provide a functional genomics framework for future research needed to fully realize the promise of GWAS in identifying targets for geroprotective prevention and therapeutics against preeclampsia.",

        "Title": "A comprehensive integrated post-GWAS analysis of Type 1 diabetes reveals enhancer-based immune dysregulation.",
        "Abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease, whereby immune cell-mediated killing leads to loss of the insulin-producing β cells in the pancreas. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 200 genetic variants associated with risk for T1D. The majority of the GWAS risk variants reside in the non-coding regions of the genome, suggesting that gene regulatory changes substantially contribute to T1D. However, identification of causal regulatory variants associated with T1D risk and their affected genes is challenging due to incomplete knowledge of non-coding regulatory elements and the cellular states and processes in which they function. Here, we performed a comprehensive integrated post-GWAS analysis of T1D to identify functional regulatory variants in enhancers and their cognate target genes. Starting with 1,817 candidate T1D SNPs defined from the GWAS catalog and LDlink databases, we conducted functional annotation analysis using genomic data from various public databases. These include 1) Roadmap Epigenomics, ENCODE, and RegulomeDB for epigenome data; 2) GTEx for tissue-specific gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci data; and 3) lncRNASNP2 for long non-coding RNA data. Our results indicated a prevalent enhancer-based immune dysregulation in T1D pathogenesis. We identified 26 high-probability causal enhancer SNPs associated with T1D, and 64 predicted target genes. The majority of the target genes play major roles in antigen presentation and immune response and are regulated through complex transcriptional regulatory circuits, including those in HLA (6p21) and non-HLA (16p11.2) loci. These candidate causal enhancer SNPs are supported by strong evidence and warrant functional follow-up studies.",

        "Abstract": "Gene variants associated with longevity are also associated with protection against cognitive decline, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that common physiologic pathways act at the interface of longevity and cognitive function. To test the hypothesis that variants in genes implicated in cognitive function may promote exceptional longevity, we performed a comprehensive 3-stage study to identify functional longevity-associated variants in ~700 candidate genes in up to 450 centenarians and 500 controls by target capture sequencing analysis. We found an enrichment of longevity-associated genes in the nPKC and NF-κB signaling pathways by gene-based association analyses. Functional analysis of the top three gene variants (NFKBIA, CLU, PRKCH) suggests that non-coding variants modulate the expression of cognate genes, thereby reducing signaling through the nPKC and NF-κB. This matches genetic studies in multiple model organisms, suggesting that the evolutionary conservation of reduced PKC and NF-κB signaling pathways in exceptional longevity may include humans.",

        "Abstract": "The rich data from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) offer an unprecedented opportunity to identify the biological underpinnings of age-related disease (ARD) risk and multimorbidity. Surprisingly, however, a comprehensive list of ARDs remains unavailable due to the lack of a clear definition and selection criteria. We developed a method to identify ARDs and to provide a compendium of ARDs for genetic association studies. Querying 1,358 electronic medical record-derived traits, we first defined ARDs and age-related traits (ARTs) based on their prevalence profiles, requiring a unimodal distribution that shows an increasing prevalence after the age of 40 years, and which reaches a maximum peak at 60 years of age or later. As a result, we identified a list of 463 ARDs and ARTs in the GWAS and PheWAS catalogs. We next translated the ARDs and ARTs to their respective 276 Medical Subject Headings diseases and 45 anatomy terms. The most abundant disease categories are neoplasms (48 terms), cardiovascular diseases (44 terms), and nervous system diseases (27 terms). Employing data from a human symptoms-disease network, we found 6 symptom-shared disease groups, representing cancers, heart diseases, brain diseases, joint diseases, eye diseases, and mixed diseases. Lastly, by overlaying our ARD and ART list with genetic correlation data from the UK Biobank, we found 54 phenotypes in 2 clusters with high genetic correlations. Our compendium of ARD and ART is a highly useful resource, with broad applicability for studies of the genetics of aging, ARD, and multimorbidity.",

        "Abstract": "The last few years have seen tremendous advances in CRISPR-mediated genome editing. Great efforts have been made to improve the efficiency, specificity, editing window, and targeting scope of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgene knock-in and gene correction. In this article, we comprehensively review recent progress in CRISPR-based strategies for targeted transgene knock-in and gene correction in both homology-dependent and homology-independent approaches. We cover homology-directed repair (HDR), synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), and homology-mediated end joining (HMEJ) pathways for a homology-dependent strategy and alternative DNA repair pathways such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), base excision repair (BER), and mismatch repair (MMR) for a homology-independent strategy. We also discuss base editing and prime editing that enable direct conversion of nucleotides in genomic DNA without damaging the DNA or requiring donor DNA. Notably, we illustrate the key mechanisms and design principles for each strategy, providing design guidelines for multiplex, flexible, scarless gene insertion and replacement at high efficiency and specificity. In addition, we highlight next-generation base editors that provide higher editing efficiency, fewer undesired by-products, and broader targeting scope.",

        "Abstract": "Many studies utilizing animal models have revealed the genetic and pharmacogenetic modulators of the rate of organismal aging. However, finding routes for healthy aging during extended life remains one of the largest questions. With regards to an antiaging reagent, it has been shown that natural phytochemical syringaresinol (SYR) delays cellular senescence by activating sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Here, it is found that SYR treatment results in metabolic changes similar to those observed during dietary restriction (DR). The DR mimetic effects are mediated by FoxO3a-dependent SIRT1 activation and insulin/insuline growth factor-1 signaling modulation. The direct binding of SYR-FoxO3a is identified and this could partially explain the DR-like phenotype. The report gives a clue as to how the longevity gene involves the DR pathway and suggests that natural phytochemicals applied as a geroprotector mimics DR effects.",

The accumulation of damage including DNA damage contributes to driving cell signaling pathways that, in turn, can drive different cell fates, including senescence and apoptosis, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. In addition, the accumulation of cell autonomous damage with time also drives ageing through non-cell autonomous pathways by modulation of signaling pathways. Interestingly, genetic and pharmacologic analysis of factors able to modulate lifespan and healthspan in model organisms and even humans have identified several key signaling pathways including IGF-1, NF-κB, FOXO3, mTOR, Nrf-2 and sirtuins. This review will discuss the roles of several of these key signaling pathways, in particular NF-κB and Nrf2, in modulating ageing and age-related diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid advancement of CRISPR technology has enabled targeted epigenome editing and transcriptional modulation in the native chromatin context. However, only a few studies have reported the successful editing of the epigenome in adult animals in contrast to the rapidly growing number of in vivo genome editing over the past few years. In this review, we discuss the challenges facing in vivo epigenome editing and new strategies to overcome the huddles. The biggest challenge has been the difficulty in packaging dCas9 fusion proteins required for manipulation of epigenome into the adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery vehicle. We review the strategies to address the AAV packaging issue, including small dCas9 orthologues, truncated dCas9 mutants, a split-dCas9 system, and potent truncated effector domains. We discuss the dCas9 conjugation strategies to recruit endogenous chromatin modifiers and remodelers to specific genomic loci, and recently developed methods to recruit multiple copies of the dCas9 fusion protein, or to simultaneous express multiple gRNAs for robust epigenome editing or synergistic transcriptional modulation. The use of Cre-inducible dCas9-expressing mice or a genetic cross between dCas9- and sgRNA-expressing flies has also helped overcome the transgene delivery issue. We provide perspective on how a combination use of these strategies can facilitate in vivo epigenome editing and transcriptional modulation.",

        "Abstract": "Skeletal muscle is one of the major organs responsible for body movements and metabolism making up approximately 40% of the total body mass. During aging, skeletal muscle exhibits a degenerative age-associated decline in mass and function termed sarcopenia. This age-associated dysfunction of skeletal muscle is a major criterion of morbidity, mortality, and overall declines of quality of life in the elderly people. Therefore, researchers have focused on identifying modulators of muscle aging process including messenger RNAs, proteins, and recently small noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs). In particular, miRNAs have been demonstrated to play a critical role in skeletal muscle development and homeostasis. Recent studies revealed that miRNAs were also involved in muscle aging processes and the rejuvenation of aged muscle by regulating important molecules and pathways of aging including insulin-like growth factors, nicotine-adenine dinucleotide (+)-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1, telomerase reverse transcriptase, and transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway. Over the years, miRNAs have emerged as promising candidates for biomarkers of sarcopenia and targets for interventions to slow muscle aging. Here, we comprehensively review the current knowledge on the role of miRNAs in skeletal muscle aging and highlight their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for skeletal muscle health.",

        "Abstract": "Identification of all genetic variants associated with complex traits is one of the most important goals in modern human genetics. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully applied to identify common variants, which thus far explain only small portion of heritability. Interests in rare variants have been increasingly growing as an answer for this missing heritability. While next-generation sequencing allows detection of rare variants, its cost is still prohibitively high to sequence a large number of human DNA samples required for rare variant association studies. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of sequencing for pooled DNA samples of multiple individuals (Pool-seq) as a cost-effective and robust approach for rare variant discovery. We comparatively analyzed Pool-seq vs. individual-seq of indexed target capture of up to 960 genes in ∼1000 individuals, followed by independent genotyping validation studies. We found that Pool-seq was as effective and accurate as individual-seq in detecting rare variants and accurately estimating their minor allele frequencies (MAFs). Our results suggest that Pool-seq can be used as an efficient and cost-effective method for discovery of rare variants for population-based sequencing studies in individual laboratories.",

With the advent of genome- and epigenome-editing tools based on the CRISPR technology, it is now possible to test the functional relevance of the regulatory elements and alterations on a genomic scale.

To identify truly causal non-coding variants and their affected target genes remains challenging but is a critical step to translate the genetic associations to molecular mechanisms and ultimately clinical applications. Here we review genomic/epigenomic resources and in silico tools that can be used to identify causal non-coding variants and experimental strategies to validate their functionalities. Impact statement Most signals from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) map to the non-coding genome, and functional interpretation of these associations remained challenging. We reviewed recent progress in methodologies of studying the non-coding genome and argued that no single approach allows one to effectively identify the causal regulatory variants from GWAS results. By illustrating the advantages and limitations of each method, our review potentially provided a guideline for taking a combinatorial approach to accurately predict, prioritize, and eventually experimentally validate the causal variants.",

        "Abstract": "Age-associated loss of muscle mass and function is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly adults. Muscular atrophy can also be induced by disuse associated with long-term bed rest or disease. Although miRNAs regulate muscle growth, regeneration, and aging, their potential role in acute muscle atrophy is poorly understood. Furthermore, alterations in circulating miRNA levels have been shown to occur during aging but their potential as noninvasive biomarkers for muscle atrophy remains largely unexplored. Here, we report comprehensive miRNA expression profiles by miRNA-seq analysis in tibialis anterior muscle and serum of a disuse-induced atrophy mouse model, mimicking the acute atrophy following long-term bed rest, as compared to those of young and old mice. Comparative analysis and validation studies have revealed that miR-455-3p was significantly decreased in muscle of both induced-atrophy model and old mice, whereas miR-434-3p was decreased in both serum and muscle of old mice, as compared to young mice. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-455-3p in fully differentiated C2C12 myoblasts induced a hypertrophic phenotype. These results suggest that deregulation of miR-455-3p may play a functional role in muscle atrophy and miR-434-3p could be a candidate serum biomarker of muscle aging.",

        "Title": "Mutation and catastrophe in the aging genome.",
        "Abstract": "In the 1960s, Leslie Orgel proposed what is now known as the error catastrophe theory of aging, arguing that errors in protein translation that reduce the fidelity of the protein-translating enzymes would lead to a feedback loop of increasingly inaccurate protein synthesis, terminating in the death of the organism. This mechanism of aging would be consistent with the exponential increase of mortality observed in humans, but the error catastrophe theory of aging has been generally disregarded by researchers due to a lack of evidence for an age-related increase in protein errors. Another theory of aging, proposed at roughly the same time, is Leo Szilard's two-hit model of somatic mutation accumulation, which assumed a linear increase in mutations over time but explained the nonlinear pattern of human mortality through a mechanism of genetic and cellular redundancy which kept mortality low until the redundancy was exhausted, at which point mortality rapidly rose. Here, we synthesize the two theories, along with the latest advances in genomics research. We propose a new catastrophe theory of aging, this time with somatic mutations as the primary agent of the feedback loop. Similar to protein errors affecting translation itself, somatic mutations in genes involved in DNA replication and repair would lead to a feedback loop of exponentially increasing mutation load. The difference from protein errors is that somatic mutations would mainly affect gene regulatory regions rather than the much smaller part of the genome encoding protein-coding information. Although the self-stimulating accumulation of somatic mutations is not mutually exclusive with the Szilard-based loss of redundancy, we present evidence that suggests that the accumulated mutations themselves could be numerous enough to cause mortality. Finally, we acknowledge the limits of our current knowledge and propose a course of research practices that will help to confirm or refute our model and advance the field of aging research as a whole.",

        "Abstract": "Human aging is a lifelong process characterized by a continuous trade-off between pro-and anti-inflammatory responses, where the best-adapted and/or remodeled genetic/epigenetic profile may develop a longevity phenotype. Centenarians and their offspring represent such a phenotype and their comparison to patients with age-related diseases (ARDs) is expected to maximize the chance to unravel the genetic makeup that better associates with healthy aging trajectories. Seemingly, such comparison is expected to allow the discovery of new biomarkers of longevity together with risk factor for the most common ARDs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and their shuttles (extracellular vesicles in particular) are currently conceived as those endowed with the strongest ability to provide information about the trajectories of healthy and unhealthy aging. We review the available data on miRNAs in aging and underpin the evidence suggesting that circulating miRNAs (and cognate shuttles), especially those involved in the regulation of inflammation (inflamma-miRs) may constitute biomarkers capable of reliably depicting healthy and unhealthy aging trajectories.",

        "Abstract": "The recent advent of genome and epigenome editing technologies has provided a new paradigm in which the landscape of the human genome and epigenome can be precisely manipulated in their native context. Genome and epigenome editing technologies can be applied to many aspects of aging research and offer the potential to develop novel therapeutics against age-related diseases. Here, we discuss the latest technological advances in the CRISPR-based genome and epigenome editing toolbox, and provide insight into how these synthetic biology tools could facilitate aging research by establishing in vitro cell and in vivo animal models to dissect genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying aging and age-related diseases. We discuss recent developments in the field with the aims to precisely modulate gene expression and dynamic epigenetic landscapes in a spatial and temporal manner in cellular and animal models, by complementing the CRISPR-based editing capability with conditional genetic manipulation tools including chemically inducible expression systems, optogenetics, logic gate genetic circuits, tissue-specific promoters, and the serotype-specific adeno-associated virus. We also discuss how the combined use of genome and epigenome editing tools permits investigators to uncover novel molecular pathways involved in the pathophysiology and etiology conferred by risk variants associated with aging and aging-related disease. A better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying human aging and age-related disease will significantly contribute to the developments of new therapeutic interventions for extending health span and life span, ultimately improving the quality of life in the elderly populations.",

Here, we take advantage of the catalog of human genome-wide associations, whole-genome tissue expression and expression quantitative trait loci datasets, and annotated mitochondrial proteome databases to examine the role of common genetic variation in mitonuclear genes in human disease. Through pathway-based analysis we identified distinct functional pathways and tissue expression profiles associated with each of the major human diseases. Among our most striking findings, we observe that mitonuclear genes associated with cancer are broadly expressed among human tissues and largely represent one functional process, intrinsic apoptosis, while mitonuclear genes associated with other diseases, such as neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, show tissue-specific expression profiles and are associated with unique functional pathways. These results provide new insight into human diseases using unbiased genome-wide approaches.",

Two common APOE alleles are either significantly depleted (ε4 allele) or enriched (ε2 allele) in long-lived individuals as compared to controls. We performed high-throughput sequencing analysis of exons and 2kb proximal promoter of APOE in 450 centenarians and 500 controls of Ashkenazi Jewish decent. We found two common regulatory variants, rs405509 (p=0.006) and rs769449 (p=0.036), that were significantly depleted in centenarians. Genotyping analysis of rs7412 and rs429358 showed significant enrichment of ε2 allele (p=0.003) and ε2/ε3 genotype (p=0.005), and significant depletion of ε3/ε4 genotype (p=0.005) in centenarians.

        "Abstract": "Aging is associated with an increased risk of cancer, possibly in part because of an age-related increase in mutations in normal tissues. Due to their extremely low abundance, somatic mutations in normal tissues frequently escape detection. Tumors, as clonal expansions of single cells, can provide information about the somatic mutations present in these cells prior to tumorigenesis. Here, we used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), to systematically study the frequency and spectrum of somatic mutations in a total of 6,969 patients and 34 different tumor types as a function of the age of the patient. After using linear modeling to control for the age structure of different tumor types, we found that the number of identified somatic mutations increases exponentially with age. Using additional data from the literature, we found that accumulation of somatic mutations is associated with cell division rate, cancer risk and cigarette smoking, with the latter also associated with a distinct spectrum of mutations. Our results confirm that aging is associated with the accumulation of somatic mutations, and strongly suggest that the level of genome instability of normal cells, modified by both endogenous and environmental factors, is the main risk factor for cancer.",

        "Title": "An epigenomic role of Fe65 in the cellular response to DNA damage.",
        "Abstract": "Previous findings describe Fe65 as a key protein in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which Fe65 contributes to DNA damage signaling remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that the transcriptional activity of Fe65 may contribute to DNA damage pathways by regulating gene expression patterns activated in response to genotoxic stress. To address this hypothesis, we mapped the global binding profile of Fe65 by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing in the SK-N-SH cells exposed to genotoxic stress. Unexpectedly, the genome-wide location analysis showed a substantial enrichment of Fe65 in the promoter regions of coding genes linked to DNA damage signaling pathways. To further investigate the role of Fe65 in the transcriptional regulation of putative coding target genes identified by ChIP-seq, we performed microarray assays using wild-type (WT) or Fe65 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exposed to oxidative stress with multiple recovery times. Gene ontology analysis of the Fe65-depedent transcriptome suggested that Fe65 modulates the expression of genes critical for DNA damage response. Motif enrichment analysis of regulatory regions occupied by Fe65 revealed a strong correlation with key transcription factors involved in DNA damage signaling pathways, including E2F1, p53, and Jun. Comparison of ChIP-sequencing results with microarray results ultimately identified 248 Fe65-depedent target genes, the majority of which were known regulators of cell cycle, cell death, and DNA replication and repair pathways. We validated the target genes identified by in silico analysis by qPCR experiments. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that Fe65 plays a role in DNA damage response and cell viability by epigenomic regulation of specific transcriptional programs activated upon genotoxic stress.",

        "Abstract": "Aging is the single largest risk factor for chronic disease. Studies in model organisms have identified conserved pathways that modulate aging rate and the onset and progression of multiple age-related diseases, suggesting that common pathways of aging may influence age-related diseases in humans as well. To determine whether there is genetic evidence supporting the notion of common pathways underlying age-related diseases, we analyzed the genes and pathways found to be associated with five major categories of age-related disease using a total of 410 genomewide association studies (GWAS). While only a small number of genes are shared among all five disease categories, those found in at least three of the five major age-related disease categories are highly enriched for apoliprotein metabolism genes. We found that a more substantial number of gene ontology (GO) terms are shared among the 5 age-related disease categories and shared GO terms include canonical aging pathways identified in model organisms, such as nutrient-sensing signaling, translation, proteostasis, stress responses, and genome maintenance. Taking advantage of the vast amount of genetic data from the GWAS, our findings provide the first direct evidence that conserved pathways of aging simultaneously influence multiple age-related diseases in humans as has been demonstrated in model organisms.",

        "Title": "MicroRNA transcriptome analysis identifies miR-365 as a novel negative regulator of cell proliferation in Zmpste24-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts.",
        "Abstract": "Zmpste24 is a metalloproteinase responsible for the posttranslational processing and cleavage of prelamin A into mature laminA. Zmpste24(-/-) mice display a range of progeroid phenotypes overlapping with mice expressing progerin, an altered version of lamin A associated with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Increasing evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs contribute to the regulation of normal aging process, but their roles in progeroid disorders remain poorly understood. Here we report the miRNA transcriptomes of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) established from wild type (WT) and Zmpste24(-/-) progeroid mice using a massively parallel sequencing technology. With data from 19.5 × 10(6) reads from WT MEFs and 16.5 × 10(6) reads from Zmpste24(-/-) MEFs, we discovered a total of 306 known miRNAs expressed in MEFs with a wide dynamic range of read counts ranging from 10 to over 1 million. A total of 8 miRNAs were found to be significantly down-regulated, with only 2 miRNAs upregulated, in Zmpste24(-/-) MEFs as compared to WT MEFs. Functional studies revealed that miR-365, a significantly down-regulated miRNA in Zmpste24(-/-) MEFs, modulates cellular growth phenotypes in MEFs. Overexpression of miR-365 in Zmpste24(-/-) MEFs increased cellular proliferation and decreased the percentage of SA-β-gal-positive cells, while inhibition of miR-365 function led to an increase of SA-β-gal-positive cells in WT MEFs. Furthermore, we identified Rasd1, a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, as a functional target of miR-365. While expression of miR-365 suppressed Rasd1 3' UTR luciferase-reporter activity, this effect was lost with mutations in the putative 3' UTR target-site. Consistently, expression levels of miR-365 were found to inversely correlate with endogenous Rasd1 levels. These findings suggest that miR-365 is down-regulated in Zmpste24(-/-) MEFs and acts as a novel negative regulator of Rasd1. Our comprehensive miRNA data provide a resource to study gene regulatory networks in MEFs.",

        "Abstract": "Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is activated in response to cellular stressors to prevent cellular proteotoxicity through selective degradation of altered proteins in lysosomes. Reduced CMA activity contributes to the decrease in proteome quality in disease and ageing. Here, we report that CMA is also upregulated in response to genotoxic insults and that declined CMA functionality leads to reduced cell survival and genomic instability. This role of CMA in genome quality control is exerted through regulated degradation of activated checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) by this pathway after the genotoxic insult. Nuclear accumulation of Chk1 in CMA-deficient cells compromises cell cycle progression and prolongs the time that DNA damage persists in these cells. Furthermore, blockage of CMA leads to hyperphosphorylation and destabilization of the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex, which participates in early steps of particular DNA repair pathways. We propose that CMA contributes to maintain genome stability by assuring nuclear proteostasis.",

        "Abstract": "There is a need to develop a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test that is noninvasive, cost effective, and sensitive enough to detect preneoplastic lesions. This case-control study examined the feasibility of using circulating extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) to differentiate a spectrum of colorectal neoplasia of various severity and hence for early detection of colorectal neoplasia. Archived serum samples of 10 normal controls and 31 cases, including 10 with nonadvanced adenoma, 10 with advanced adenoma, and 11 with CRC, were profiled for circulating miRNAs using next-generation sequencing. Multiple linear regression, adjusting for age, gender, and smoking status, compared controls and the 3 case groups for levels of 175 miRNAs that met stringent criteria for miRNA sequencing analysis. Of the 175 miRNAs, 106 miRNAs were downregulated according to severity of neoplasia and showed a relative decrease in the expression from controls to nonadvanced adenoma to advanced adenoma to CRC (Ptrend < 0.05). Pairwise group comparisons showed that 39 and 80 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the advanced adenoma and CRC groups compared with the controls, respectively. Differences in miRNA levels between the nonadvanced adenoma group and controls were modest. Our study found that expression of many miRNAs in serum was inversely correlated with the severity of colorectal neoplasia, and differential miRNA profiles were apparent in preneoplastic cases with advanced lesions, suggesting circulating miRNAs could serve as potential biomarkers for CRC screening.",

        "Abstract": "The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway regulates critical biological processes including development, homeostasis, and aging. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in a myriad of diseases such as cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders, making the IGF-1 signaling pathway a prime target to develop therapeutic and intervention strategies. Recently, small non-coding RNA molecules in ∼22 nucleotide length, microRNAs (miRNAs), have emerged as a new regulator of biological processes in virtually all organ systems and increasing studies are linking altered miRNA function to disease mechanisms. A miRNA binds to 3'UTRs of multiple target genes and coordinately downregulates their expression, thereby exerting a profound influence on gene regulatory networks. Here we review the components of the IGF-1 signaling pathway that are known targets of miRNA regulation, and highlight recent studies that suggest therapeutic potential of these miRNAs against various diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a master regulator of hypoxic response and has been a prime therapeutic target for ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-derived myocardial dysfunction and tissue damage. There is also increasing evidence that HIF-1 plays a central role in regulating aging, both through interactions with key longevity factors including Sirtuins and mTOR, as well as by directly promoting longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.We investigated a novel function and the underlying mechanism of syringaresinol, a lignan compound, in modulation of HIF-1 and protection against cellular damage and death in a cardiomyocyte model of I/R injury. Syringaresinol caused destabilization of HIF-1α following H/R and then protected against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cellular damage, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner. Knock-down of FOXO3 by specific siRNAs completely abolished the ability of syringaresinol to inhibit HIF-1 stabilization and apoptosis caused by H/R. Syringaresinol stimulated the nuclear localization and activity of FOXO3 leading to increased expression of antioxidant genes and decreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following H/R. Our results provide a new mechanistic insight into a functional role of syringaresinol against H/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury and death. The degradation of HIF-1α through activation of FOXO3 is a potential therapeutic strategy for ischemia-related diseases.",

These cell-free, circulating miRNAs can be taken into and function as negative regulators of target genes in recipient cells.

        "Abstract": "Accumulation of DNA damage and mutations is considered an important causal factor in age-related diseases. Genetic defects in DNA repair cause premature onset and accelerated progression of age-related diseases and a shorter life span in humans and mice, providing strong evidence that genome maintenance is a bona fide longevity assurance pathway. However, the contribution of genome maintenance to human longevity itself remains to be established. Here, we review the results of human genetics studies, including genome wide association studies, and attempted to catalogue all genes involved in major DNA repair pathways that harbor variants associated with longevity. We hope to provide a comprehensive review to facilitate future endeavors aimed at uncovering the functional role of genome maintenance genes in human longevity.",

        "Abstract": "The activity of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a catabolic pathway for selective degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes, decreases with age, but the consequences of this functional decline in vivo remain unknown. In this work, we have generated a conditional knockout mouse to selectively block CMA in liver. We have found that blockage of CMA causes hepatic glycogen depletion and hepatosteatosis. The liver phenotype is accompanied by reduced peripheral adiposity, increased energy expenditure, and altered glucose homeostasis. Comparative lysosomal proteomics revealed that key enzymes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are normally degraded by CMA and that impairment of their regulated degradation contributes to the metabolic abnormalities observed in CMA-defective animals. These findings highlight the involvement of CMA in regulating hepatic metabolism and suggest that the age-related decline in CMA may have a negative impact on the energetic balance in old organisms.",

        "Abstract": "miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in numerous physiological processes. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pre-miRNAs may change their property through altering miRNAs expression and/or maturation, resulting in diverse functional consequences. To date, the role of genetic variants in pre-miRNAs on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk remains poorly understood. Here we aimed to evaluate the influence of three common SNPs in pre-miRNAs (miR-146a rs2910164 G>C, miR-196a2 rs11614913 C>T, miR-499 rs3746444 T>C) on individual susceptibility to CAD in a Chinese population of 295 CAD patients and 283 controls. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. In a logistic regression analysis, we detected an association of rs2910164 in pre-miR-146a with the CAD risk; compared with the GG homozygotes, the GC heterozygotes [odds ratio (OR)=1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.06-3.36, P=0.029] and the CC homozygotes (OR=1.83, 95% CI=1.01-3.32, P=0.046) genotype were statistically significantly associated with the increased risk for CADs. As we used further genotype association models, we found a similar trend of the association in recessive model (OR=1.86, 95% CI=1.09-3.19, P=0.023). We also found that the genotypes of miR-146a rs2910164 were associated with its mature miRNA expression by analyzing 23 PBMC samples from CAD patients. Individuals carrying rs11614913 GC or CC genotypes showed 3.2-fold higher expression compared to GG genotype carriers (P<0.05). We observed no association of the other two SNPs in miR-196a2 (rs11614913) and miR-499 (rs3746444) with the CAD incidence. Our data provide the first evidence that the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism is associated with increased risk of CAD in Chinese Han population, which may be through influencing the expression levels of the miRNA.",

A single miRNA can target up to several hundred mRNAs, thus capable of significantly altering gene expression regulatory networks. In-depth study and characterization of miRNAs has elucidated their critical functions in development, homeostasis, and disease. A link between miRNAs and longevity has been demonstrated in C. elegans, implicating their role in regulation of lifespan and in the aging process. Recent years have witnessed unprecedented technological advances in studies of miRNAs, including ultra-high throughput sequencing technologies that allow comprehensive discovery of miRNAs and their targets. Here we review the latest experimental approaches from the perspective of understanding miRNA gene expression regulatory networks in aging. We provide a methodological work flow that can be employed to discover aging-related miRNAs and their targets, and to functionally validate their roles in aging. Finally, we review the links between miRNAs known to act in the conserved pathways of aging and major aging-related diseases.

        "Abstract": "Increased SIRT1 expression exerts beneficial effects in transgenic animal models, ameliorating the onset and progression of aging-related disease phenotypes in various organs including the heart. The potential beneficial effects of SIRT1 have made SIRT1 a prime therapeutic target for age-related diseases and considerable efforts led to the identification of small molecule activator of SIRT1 protein. Thus far, however, a small molecule activator of SIRT1 gene expression has not been reported. Here, we report that syringaresinol, isolated from Panax ginseng berry pulp, is an activator of SIRT1 gene expression. Using human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs), we show that syringaresinol treatment induced binding of FOXO3 to the SIRT1 promoter in a sequence-specific manner, leading to induction of SIRT1 expression. Increased SIRT1 expression in HUVECs by syringaresinol treatment delayed cellular senescence and improved various markers of endothelial functions in a FOXO3 dependent manner. Collectively, these findings bring to light a new transcription activator of SIRT1 that may have therapeutic potential.",

        "Title": "Genome instability and aging.",
        "Abstract": "Genome instability has long been implicated as the main causal factor in aging. Somatic cells are continuously exposed to various sources of DNA damage, from reactive oxygen species to UV radiation to environmental mutagens. To cope with the tens of thousands of chemical lesions introduced into the genome of a typical cell each day, a complex network of genome maintenance systems acts to remove damage and restore the correct base pair sequence. Occasionally, however, repair is erroneous, and such errors, as well as the occasional failure to correctly replicate the genome during cell division, are the basis for mutations and epimutations. There is now ample evidence that mutations accumulate in various organs and tissues of higher animals, including humans, mice, and flies. What is not known, however, is whether the frequency of these random changes is sufficient to cause the phenotypic effects generally associated with aging. The exception is cancer, an age-related disease caused by the accumulation of mutations and epimutations. Here, we first review current concepts regarding the relationship between DNA damage, repair, and mutation, as well as the data regarding genome alterations as a function of age. We then describe a model for how randomly induced DNA sequence and epigenomic variants in the somatic genomes of animals can result in functional decline and disease in old age. Finally, we discuss the genetics of genome instability in relation to longevity to address the importance of alterations in the somatic genome as a causal factor in aging and to underscore the opportunities provided by genetic approaches to develop interventions that attenuate genome instability, reduce disease risk, and increase life span.",

        "Abstract": "Despite evidence of a substantial genetic component, the genetic factors that underlie longevity in humans remain to be identified. Previous genome-wide linkage and association studies have not found strong evidence for the contribution of common variants besides the APOE gene, suggesting the role of rare variants in human longevity. To discover rare variants that might contribute to longevity, we selected 988 candidate genes and performed a pilot study to identify novel non-synonymous variants in 6 Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians older than 105. Our candidate genes act in pathways implicated in aging and longevity, including neurodegeneration, cognitive function, lipid metabolism, DNA repair, and genome maintenance. By implementing custom-designed Agilent SureSelect target capture and next-generation sequencing, we discovered a total of 89 novel non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and validated 51 nsSNPs by iPLEX MassArray assays. Genotyping analysis of these novel SNPs in 410 Ashkenazi Jewish controls and 390 centenarians showed significant enrichment (5.3 fold, p = 0.02) of the p.Y318C variant in PMS2 and significant depletion (7.5 fold, p = 0.04) of the p.V465A variant in GABRR3 in centenarians compared to controls. Our study presents the potential of targeted next-generation sequencing for discovery of rare but functional genetic variation which may lead to exceptional longevity in humans.",

        "Abstract": "SIRT1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein deacetylase that modulates stress response, cellular metabolism and aging in model organisms. While SIRT1 exerts beneficial effects in protecting against age-related diseases, the role of SIRT1 in cancer has been controversial. SIRT1 promotes cell survival by deacetylating, and thereby negatively regulating the activity of important tumor suppressors such as p53. In this regard, SIRT1 has been considered to be a potential oncogene, and SIRT1 inhibitors have been studied for possible anticancer therapeutic effects. In contrast, it has been shown that SIRT1 deficiency leads to increased genomic instability and tumorigenesis, and that overexpression of SIRT1 attenuates cancer formation in mice, suggesting it may also act as a tumor suppressor. Based on this evidence, SIRT1-activating molecules could act as candidate chemotherapeutic drugs. In order to gain insight into the role of SIRT1 in cancer, we performed a comprehensive resequencing analysis of the SIRT1 gene in 41 tumor cell lines and found an unusually excessive homozygosity, which was confirmed to be allelic loss by microsatellite analysis. Furthermore, we found two novel SIRT1 mutations (D739Y and R65_A72del) in addition to the known, rare non-synonymous variation resulting in I731V. In vitro assays using purified SIRT1 protein showed that these mutations do not alter SIRT1 deacetylase activity or telomerase activity, which was shown to be regulated by SIRT1. We conclude that allelic loss or mutations in the SIRT1 gene occur prevalently during tumorigenesis, supporting the assertion that SIRT1 may serve as a tumor suppressor.",

        "Abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have attracted considerable attention in the fields of cell and gene therapy due to their intrinsic ability to differentiate into multiple lineages. The various therapeutic applications involving MSC require initial expansion and/or differentiation in vitro prior to clinical use. However, serial passages of MSC in culture lead to decreased differentiation potential and stem cell characteristics, eventually inducing cellular aging which will limit the success of cell-based therapeutic interventions. Here we review the age-related changes that occur in MSC with a special focus on the shift of differentiation potential from osteogenic to adipogenic lineage during the MSC aging processes and how aging causes this preferential shift by oxidative stress and/or energy metabolism defect. Oxidative stress-related signals and some microRNAs affect the differentiation potential shift of MSC by directly targeting key regulatory factors such as Runx-2 or PPAR-γ, and energy metabolism pathway is involved as well. All information described here including transcription factors, microRNAs and FoxOs could be used towards development of treatment regimens for age-related bone diseases and related defects based on mutually exclusive lineage fate determination of MSC.",

Extremely long-lived individuals, such as centenarians, have managed to ward off age-related diseases and serve as human models to search for the genetic factors that influence longevity. The discovery of evolutionarily conserved pathways with major impact on life span in animal models has provided tantalizing opportunities to test the relevance of these pathways for human longevity. Here we specifically focus on the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling as a prime candidate pathway. Coupled with the rapid advances in ultra high-throughput sequencing technologies, it is now feasible to comprehensively analyze all possible sequence variants in candidate genes segregating with a longevity phenotype and to investigate the functional consequences of the associated variants. A better understanding of the functional genes that affect healthy longevity in humans may lead to a rational basis for intervention strategies that can delay or prevent age-related diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Dampening of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) signaling results in the extension of lifespan in invertebrate as well as murine models. The impact of this evolutionarily conserved pathway on the modulation of human lifespan remains unclear. We previously identified two IGF1R mutations (Ala-37-Thr and Arg-407-His) that are enriched in Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians as compared to younger controls and are associated with the reduced activity of the IGF1 receptor as measured in immortalized lymphocytes. To determine whether these human longevity-associated IGF1R mutations affect IGF1 signaling, we engineered mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing the different human IGF1R variants in a mouse Igf1r null background. The results indicate that MEFs expressing the human longevity-associated IGF1R mutations attenuated IGF1 signaling, as demonstrated by significant reduction in phosphorylation of both IGF1R and AKT after IGF1 treatment, in comparison with MEFs expressing the wild-type IGF1R. The impaired IGF1 signaling caused by the IGF1R mutations resulted in the reduced induction of the major IGF1-activated genes in MEFs, including EGR1, mCSF, IL3Rα, and TDAG51. Furthermore, the IGF1R mutations caused a delay in cell cycle progression after IGF1 treatment, indicating a dysfunctional physiological response to a cell proliferation signal. These results demonstrate that the human longevity-associated IGF1R variants are reduced-function mutations, implying that dampening of IGF1 signaling may be a longevity mechanism in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Telomere length in humans is emerging as a biomarker of aging because its shortening is associated with aging-related diseases and early mortality. However, genetic mechanisms responsible for these associations are not known. Here, in a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, their offspring, and offspring-matched controls, we studied the inheritance and maintenance of telomere length and variations in two major genes associated with telomerase enzyme activity, hTERT and hTERC. We demonstrated that centenarians and their offspring maintain longer telomeres compared with controls with advancing age and that longer telomeres are associated with protection from age-related diseases, better cognitive function, and lipid profiles of healthy aging. Sequence analysis of hTERT and hTERC showed overrepresentation of synonymous and intronic mutations among centenarians relative to controls. Moreover, we identified a common hTERT haplotype that is associated with both exceptional longevity and longer telomere length. Thus, variations in human telomerase gene that are associated with better maintenance of telomere length may confer healthy aging and exceptional longevity in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Unrepaired or misrepaired DNA damage has been implicated as a causal factor in cancer and aging. Xpd(TTD) mice, harboring defects in nucleotide excision repair and transcription due to a mutation in the Xpd gene (R722W), display severe symptoms of premature aging but have a reduced incidence of cancer. To gain further insight into the molecular basis of the mutant-specific manifestation of age-related phenotypes, we used comparative microarray analysis of young and old female livers to discover gene expression signatures distinguishing Xpd(TTD) mice from their age-matched wild type controls. We found a transcription signature of increased apoptosis in the Xpd(TTD) mice, which was confirmed by in situ immunohistochemical analysis and found to be accompanied by increased proliferation. However, apoptosis rate exceeded the rate of proliferation, resulting in homeostatic imbalance. Interestingly, a metabolic response signature was observed involving decreased energy metabolism and reduced IGF-1 signaling, a major modulator of life span. We conclude that while the increased apoptotic response to endogenous DNA damage contributes to the accelerated aging phenotypes and the reduced cancer incidence observed in the Xpd(TTD) mice, the signature of reduced energy metabolism is likely to reflect a compensatory adjustment to limit the increased genotoxic stress in these mutants. These results support a general model for premature aging in DNA repair deficient mice based on cellular responses to DNA damage that impair normal tissue homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Rather than being a passive, haphazard process of wear and tear, lifespan can be modulated actively by components of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) pathway in laboratory animals. Complete or partial loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding components of the insulin/IGFI pathway result in extension of life span in yeasts, worms, flies, and mice. This remarkable conservation throughout evolution suggests that altered signaling in this pathway may also influence human lifespan. On the other hand, evolutionary tradeoffs predict that the laboratory findings may not be relevant to human populations, because of the high fitness cost during early life. Here, we studied the biochemical, phenotypic, and genetic variations in a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, their offspring, and offspring-matched controls and demonstrated a gender-specific increase in serum IGFI associated with a smaller stature in female offspring of centenarians. Sequence analysis of the IGF1 and IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) genes of female centenarians showed overrepresentation of heterozygous mutations in the IGF1R gene among centenarians relative to controls that are associated with high serum IGFI levels and reduced activity of the IGFIR as measured in transformed lymphocytes. Thus, genetic alterations in the human IGF1R that result in altered IGF signaling pathway confer an increase in susceptibility to human longevity, suggesting a role of this pathway in modulation of human lifespan.",

        "Abstract": "Gastric carcinoma is considered to be one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. We have performed differential-display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) in order to compare the gene expression profile of gastric carcinoma and that of a normal stomach, in an attempt to identifiy differentially expressed genes associated with primary human gastric cancers. One of the down-regulated genes in gastric cancers was identified as regenerating islet-derived 3 alpha (REG3A), also known as hepatocarcinoma-intestine-pancreas/ pancreatitis-associated protein (HIP/PAP). REG3A exhibited relatively high expression levels in normal gastric mucosa. However, REG3A was found to be down-regulated in 67% (20 out of 30 samples) of primary human gastric cancers, as determined by RT-PCR. In addition, REG3A mRNA expression was not detected in stomach cancer cell lines, SNU cells. Immunohistochemical analysis further confirmed the down-regulation of REG3A expression in primary human gastric cancers. Treatment with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) resulted in the restoration of REG3A mRNA expression in the gastric cancer cell line, indicating that the transcriptional silencing of REG3A in SNU cell lines was caused by DNA methylation. Taken together, these data indicate that REG3A is down-regulated in most primary human gastric cancer cells, and might be useful in the diagnosis of gastric cancer. Further characterization of the differentially expressed gene, REG3A, should lead to a better understanding of the changes occurring at the molecular level during the development and progression of primary human gastric cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Aging of somatic cells can be defined as the gradual loss of the information embedded in the global and local properties of complex macromolecular networks. This loss of information may reflect the dynamic interplay between stochastic factors, such as the accumulation of unrepaired somatic damage, and gene-encoded programmatic responses. This would ultimately result in loss of function, impaired response to environmental challenge, and a progressively increased incidence of disease. Here the authors present the case for aging as a continuous battle between maintaining genomic integrity and ensuring sufficient cell functional mass. Focusing on aging of the liver in rodents, evidence is presented that normal aging is associated with a gradual accumulation of random alterations in the DNA of the genome as a consequence of imperfect DNA repair and a decrease in the rate of DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis is the cell's genome maintenance mechanism of last resort and an imbalance towards apoptosis can contribute to manifestations of aging-related phenotypes, as exemplified by mouse models of premature aging due to genetic defects in genome maintenance. Prospects to reset the clock in this zero sum game between survival and the maintenance of phenotypic integrity will be discussed.",

        "Abstract": "With the completion of the human genome project, attention is now rapidly shifting towards the study of individual genetic variation. The most abundant source of genetic variation in the human genome is represented by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can account for heritable inter-individual differences in complex phenotypes. Identification of SNPs that contribute to susceptibility to common diseases will provide highly accurate diagnostic information that will facilitate early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of human diseases. Over the past several years, the advancement of increasingly high-throughput and cost-effective methods to discover and measure SNPs has begun to open the door towards this endeavor. Genetic association studies are considered to be an effective approach towards the detection of SNPs with moderate effects, as in most common diseases with complex phenotypes. This requires careful study design, analysis and interpretation. In this review, we discuss genetic association studies and address the prospect for candidate gene association studies, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of indirect and direct study designs. Our focus is on the continuous need for SNP discovery methods and the use of currently available prescreening methods for large-scale genetic epidemiological research until more advanced sequencing methods currently under development will become available.",

        "Abstract": "Longevity, i.e., the property of being long-lived, has its natural limitation in the aging process. Longevity has a strong genetic component, as has become apparent from studies with a variety of organisms, from yeast to humans. Genetic screening efforts with invertebrates have unraveled multiple genetic pathways that suggest longevity is promoted through the manipulation of metabolism and the resistance to oxidative stress. To some extent, these same mechanisms appear to act in mammals also, despite considerable divergence during evolution. Thus far, evidence from population-based studies with humans suggests the importance of genes involved in cardiovascular disease as important determinants of longevity. The challenge is to test if the candidate longevity genes that have emerged from studies with model organisms exhibit genetic variation for life span in human populations. Future investigations are likely to involve large-scale case-control studies, in which large numbers of genes, corresponding to entire gene functional modules, will be assessed for all possible sequence variation and associated with detailed phenotypic information on each individual over extended periods of time. This should eventually unravel the genetic factors that contribute to each particular aging phenotype.",

        "Abstract": "Ageing is the most complex phenotype currently known, since it becomes manifest in all organs and tissues, affects an organism's entire physiology, impacts function at all levels and increases susceptibility to all major chronic diseases. Insight into the molecular and cellular targets of the ageing process would offer the unprecedented opportunity to postpone and prevent some, if not all, of its deteriorative aspects by preventive and therapeutic means. Thus far, our understanding of the causes of ageing is limited. To an important extent this is due to our inability, in the past, to study ageing systems. Instead, ample information has been gathered about individual cellular components at various ages, but this has not allowed a clear understanding of the integrated genomic circuits that control mechanisms of ageing, survival and stress responses. With the emergence of functional genomics, we finally have the opportunity to study ageing in a comprehensive manner, as a function of the dynamic network of genes that determines the physiology of an individual organism over time.",

        "Abstract": "Alterations in apoptotic potential, due to perturbations in cell signaling cascades, could underlie age-related organ-specific cellular degeneration and death. While increased apoptosis could lead to cell loss, as in neuronal degeneration, loss of apoptosis competence might well result in the loss of phenotypic fidelity of somatic cells, which could explain to some extent, the age-related increase in cancer incidence. Results from our laboratory indicate that after subjecting young and old rats to genotoxic stress in the form of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), an apoptotic response is quickly mounted in the liver of the young animals but virtually absent in the same organ of old animals (Nature Med. 8 (2002) 3). To address the possible molecular signaling defect(s) responsible for the age-related dysfunction of apoptosis in response to MMS, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 MAPKs, were evaluated in the liver of young and old rats after MMS treatment. The results demonstrated distinct age-specific patterns of MMS-induced MAPKs activation, suggesting that the balance between cell survival and apoptosis after genotoxic stress may be impaired during aging. These results are discussed in terms of the relative importance in aging of biological redundancy, a concept put forward by the late Bernard Strehler, and cellular fidelity.",
