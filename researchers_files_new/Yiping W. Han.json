        "Abstract": "The link between oral health and adverse pregnancy outcomes has been suggested by numerous epidemiological studies. More recent studies indicate the relationship between severity of periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Two virulence mechanisms are proposed: direct invasion of oral microorganisms or their components into the fetal-placenta unit and inflammatory mediators produced in the oral cavity affecting the fetal-placenta unit. While interventional periodontal therapy still yielded contradictory results, animal studies suggest that maternal supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids protects the fetus by suppressing inflammation as well as bacteria proliferation in the placenta. This article reviews the recent epidemiological, mechanistic, interventional, and therapeutic studies of oral health and adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) is a Gram-negative oral commensal, prevalent in various human diseases. It is unknown how this common commensal converts to a rampant pathogen. We report that Fn secretes an adhesin (FadA) with amyloid properties via a Fap2-like autotransporter to enhance its virulence. The extracellular FadA binds Congo Red, Thioflavin-T, and antibodies raised against human amyloid Î²42. Fn produces amyloid-like FadA under stress and disease conditions, but not in healthy sites or tissues. It functions as a scaffold for biofilm formation, confers acid tolerance, and mediates Fn binding to host cells. Furthermore, amyloid-like FadA induces periodontal bone loss and promotes CRC progression in mice, with virulence attenuated by amyloid-binding compounds. The uncleaved signal peptide of FadA is required for the formation and stability of mature amyloid FadA fibrils. We propose a model in which hydrophobic signal peptides serve as \"hooks\" to crosslink neighboring FadA filaments to form a stable amyloid-like structure. Our study provides a potential mechanistic link between periodontal disease and CRC and suggests anti-amyloid therapies as possible interventions for Fn-mediated disease processes.",

        "Abstract": "Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) have been defined as (a) pre-term birth, when there is a delivery before 37 completed weeks (<259Â days); (b) pre-eclampsia, which is a multisystem disorder of pregnancy characterized by maternal hypertension and proteinuria after the 20th gestational week; (c) low and very low birthweight, depending on whether the weight of the baby is less of 2500Â g or <1500Â g and (d) the spontaneous death of the fetus with <20Â weeks (miscarriage) or between 20 and 36Â weeks (stillbirth). In 2012, during the Consensus Report from the Joint EFP/AAP workshop on periodontitis and systematic diseases the role of periodontal diseases on APOs was reviewed. Some years later, this evidence has grown, and an update on the literature regarding the mechanisms related to this potential association (APOs and periodontal diseases) needs to be presented. The two major pathways (direct and indirect) already accepted in 2012 are still valid nowadays. Most evidence published in the last 5Â years deals with a strong and solid evidence coming from the direct pathway while there is as scarce new evidence regarding indirect pathway. In this direct pathway, the haematological dissemination of oral microorganisms and their products, would later induce an inflammatory/Immune response in the foetal-placental unit. The most plausible route for this direct pathway is the hematogenous transmission through dental bacteremia, although not many new studies dealing with bacteremia has been performed lately.",

        "Abstract": "Postoperative infections remain a serious concern after cesarean delivery, the most common major surgical procedure in the United States. Multiple strategies have been proposed to combat this problem, including the addition of azithromycin to the standard preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. However, as obstetricians, we have failed to uniformly adopt precesarean vaginal preparation despite convincing evidence from randomized controlled trials that this technique reduces postoperative rates of endometritis by more than 50%. This reduction is similar to that seen with the addition of azithromycin. Vaginal preparation with povidone-iodine solution may target the same genital pathogens as azithromycin, which are commonly implicated in endometritis, a polymicrobial infection that may be under-addressed by our current antiseptic techniques. A recent review of maternal-fetal medicine fellows' practices at the time of cesarean delivery and recent publications on precesarean vaginal cleansing suggest that this practice has not yet gained hold in the United States.",

        "Abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum is an oral anaerobe prevalent in intrauterine infection associated with a wide spectrum of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We demonstrate here that F. nucleatum triggers placental inflammation through maternal, rather than paternal, TLR4-mediated signaling. Elimination of TLR4 from maternal endothelial cells alleviated placental inflammation and reduced fetal and neonatal death, while elimination of TLR4 in the hematopoietic cells had no effect. The placental inflammatory response followed a spatiotemporal pattern, with NF-ÎºB activation observed first in the maternal endothelial cells and then in the decidual cells surrounding the endothelium, followed by induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Supplementation of pregnant mice with fish oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids suppressed placental inflammation, reduced F. nucleatum proliferation in the placenta, and increased fetal and neonatal survival. In vitro analysis illustrates that omega-3 fatty acids inhibit bacterial-induced inflammatory responses from human umbilical cord endothelial cells. Our study therefore reveals a mechanism by which microbial infections affect pregnancy and identifies a prophylactic therapy to protect against intrauterine infections.",

This article reviews its implication in adverse pregnancy outcomes (chorioamnionitis, preterm birth, stillbirth, neonatal sepsis, preeclampsia), GI disorders (colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis), cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, respiratory tract infections, Lemierre's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. The virulence mechanisms involved in the diseases are discussed, with emphasis on its colonization, systemic dissemination, and induction of host inflammatory and tumorigenic responses. The FadA adhesin/invasin conserved in F. nucleatum is a key virulence factor and a potential diagnostic marker for F. nucleatum-associated diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) has been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but causality and underlying mechanisms remain to be established. We demonstrate that Fn adheres to, invades, and induces oncogenic and inflammatory responses to stimulate growth of CRC cells through its unique FadA adhesin. FadA binds to E-cadherin, activates Î²-catenin signaling, and differentially regulates the inflammatory and oncogenic responses. The FadA-binding site on E-cadherin is mapped to an 11-amino-acid region. A synthetic peptide derived from this region of E-cadherin abolishes FadA-induced CRC cell growth and oncogenic and inflammatory responses. The fadA gene levels in the colon tissue from patients with adenomas and adenocarcinomas are >10-100 times higher compared to normal individuals. The increased FadA expression in CRC correlates with increased expression of oncogenic and inflammatory genes. This study unveils a mechanism by which Fn can drive CRC and identifies FadA as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for CRC.",

        "Abstract": "FadA, a novel adhesin of periodontal pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum is composed of two forms, pre-FadA and mature FadA (mFadA), constituting the functional FadA complex (FadAc). By electron microscopy, we observed that mFadA formed uniformly long and thin filaments, while FadAc formed heterogeneous filaments of varying lengths and widths, as well as \"knots\". Mutants in signal peptide or in the non-alpha-helical loop retaining heterogeneous structures had binding activity while those forming aggregates or long filaments lost activity. These observations suggest short filaments and knots may be the active forms of FadA. This is the first demonstration that a signal peptide is required for the assembly of a bacterial adhesin.",

        "Abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative oral anaerobe, capable of systemic dissemination causing infections and abscesses, often in mixed-species, at different body sites. We have shown previously that F. nucleatum adheres to and invades host epithelial and endothelial cells via a novel FadA adhesin. In this study, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, a member of the cadherin family and a cell-cell junction molecule, was identified as the endothelial receptor for FadA, required for F. nucleatum binding to the cells. FadA colocalized with VE-cadherin on endothelial cells, causing relocation of VE-cadherin away from the cell-cell junctions. As a result, the endothelial permeability was increased, allowing the bacteria to cross the endothelium through loosened junctions. This crossing mechanism may explain why the organism is able to disseminate systemically to colonize in different body sites and even overcome the placental and blood-brain barriers. Co-incubation of F. nucleatum and Escherichia coli enhanced penetration of the endothelial cells by the latter in the transwell assays, suggesting F. nucleatum may serve as an 'enabler' for other microorganisms to spread systemically. This may explain why F. nucleatum is often found in mixed infections. This study reveals a possible novel dissemination mechanism utilized by pathogens.",

        "Abstract": "Microbial infection of the intrauterine environment is a major cause of preterm birth. The current paradigm indicates that intrauterine infections predominantly originate from the vaginal tract, with the organisms ascending into the sterile uterus. With the improvements in technology, an increasing number of bacterial species have been identified in intrauterine infections that do not belong to the vaginal microflora. We have demonstrated previously that intrauterine infections can originate from the oral cavity following hematogenous transmission. In this study, we begin to systemically examine what proportion of the oral microbiome can translocate to the placenta. Pooled saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were injected into pregnant mice through tail veins to mimic bacteremia, which occurs frequently during periodontal infections. The microbial species colonizing the murine placenta were detected using 16S rRNA gene-based PCR and clone analysis. A diverse group of bacterial species were identified, many of which have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans although their sources of infection were not determined. Interestingly, the majority of these species were oral commensal organisms. This may be due to a dose effect but may also indicate a unique role of commensal species in intrauterine infection. In addition, a number of species were selectively \"enriched\" during the translocation, with a higher prevalence in the placenta than in the pooled saliva or subgingival plaque samples. These observations indicate that the placental translocation was species specific. This study provides the first insight into the diversity of oral bacteria associated with intrauterine infection.",

        "Abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative oral anaerobe implicated in periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcome. The organism colonizes the mouse placenta, causing localized infection and inflammation. The mechanism of placental colonization has not been elucidated. Previous studies identified a novel adhesin from F. nucleatum, FadA, as being involved in the attachment and invasion of host cells. The fadA deletion mutant F. nucleatum 12230 US1 was defective in host cell attachment and invasion in vitro, but it also exhibited pleiotropic effects with altered cell morphology and growth rate. In this study, a fadA-complementing clone, F. nucleatum 12230 USF81, was constructed. The expression of FadA on USF81 was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescent labeling. USF81 restored host cell attachment and invasion activities. The ability of F. nucleatum 12230, US1, and USF81 to colonize the mouse placenta was examined. US1 was severely defective in placental colonization compared to the wild type and USF81. Thus, FadA plays an important role in F. nucleatum colonization in vivo. These results also represent the first complementation studies for F. nucleatum. FadA may be a therapeutic target for preventing F. nucleatum colonization of the host.",

        "Abstract": "Many bacterial appendages have filamentous structures, often composed of repeating monomers assembled in a head-to-tail manner. The mechanisms of such linkages vary. We report here a novel protein oligomerization motif identified in the FadA adhesin from the Gram-negative bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum. The 2.0 angstroms crystal structure of the secreted form of FadA (mFadA) reveals two antiparallel alpha-helices connected by an intervening 8-residue hairpin loop. Leucine-leucine contacts play a prominent dual intra- and intermolecular role in the structure and function of FadA. First, they comprise the main association between the two helical arms of the monomer; second, they mediate the head-to-tail association of monomers to form the elongated polymers. This leucine-mediated filamentous assembly of FadA molecules constitutes a novel structural motif termed the \"leucine chain.\" The essential role of these residues in FadA is corroborated by mutagenesis of selected leucine residues, which leads to the abrogation of oligomerization, filament formation, and binding to host cells.",

        "Abstract": "Intra-amniotic infection and inflammation are major causes of preterm birth (PTB). However, intra-amniotic inflammation is often detected in the absence of infection. This may partly be due to the culturing methods employed in hospital laboratories, which are unable to detect the uncultivated species. In this study, intra-amniotic microbial infections associated with PTB were examined by both culture and 16S rRNA-based culture-independent methods and were corroborated by the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation. Amniotic fluid (AF) specimens from 46 pregnancies complicated by PTB and 16 asymptomatic women were analyzed. No bacterial DNA was amplified in AF collected from the asymptomatic women. Among the 46 samples associated with PTB, bacterial DNA was amplified from all (16/16) of the culture-positive samples and 17% (5/30) of the culture-negative samples. In the culture-positive group, additional species were detected in more than half (9/16) of the cases by PCR and clone analysis. Altogether, approximately two- thirds of the species detected by the culture-independent methods were not isolated by culture. They included both uncultivated and difficult-to-cultivate species, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Leptotrichia (Sneathia) spp., a Bergeyella sp., a Peptostreptococcus sp., Bacteroides spp., and a species of the order Clostridiales. To examine intra-amniotic inflammation, an AF proteomic fingerprint (mass-restricted score) was determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Inflammation was detected in all five samples which were culture negative but PCR positive. Women who were PCR positive more often had elevated interleukin-6 levels in their AF, histological chorioamnionitis, and funisitis and delivered neonates with early-onset neonatal sepsis. Previously unrecognized, uncultivated, or difficult-to-cultivate species may play a key role in the initiation of PTB.",

        "Abstract": "Intrauterine infection plays a pivotal role in preterm birth (PTB) and is characterized by inflammation. Currently, there is no effective therapy available to treat or prevent bacterial-induced PTB. Using Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative anaerobe frequently associated with PTB, as a model organism, the mechanism of intrauterine infection was investigated. Previously, it was shown that F. nucleatum induced preterm and term stillbirth in mice. Fusobacterial-induced placental infection was characterized by localized bacterial colonization, inflammation, and necrosis. In this study, F. nucleatum was shown to activate both TLR2 and TLR4 in vitro. In vivo, the fetal death rate was significantly reduced in TLR4-deficient mice (C57BL/6 TLR4(-/-) and C3H/HeJ (TLR4(d/d))), but not in TLR2-deficient mice (C57BL/6 TLR2(-/-)), following F. nucleatum infection. The reduced fetal death in TLR4-deficient mice was accompanied by decreased placental necroinflammatory responses in both C57BL/6 TLR4(-/-) and C3H/HeJ. Decreased bacterial colonization in the placenta was observed in C3H/HeJ, but not in C57BL/6 TLR4(-/-). These results suggest that inflammation, rather than the bacteria per se, was the likely cause of fetal loss. TLR2 did not appear to be critically involved, as no difference in bacterial colonization, inflammation, or necrosis was observed between C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 TLR2(-/-) mice. A synthetic TLR4 antagonist, TLR4A, significantly reduced fusobacterial-induced fetal death and decidual necrosis without affecting the bacterial colonization in the placentas. TLR4A had no bactericidal activity nor did it affect the birth outcome in sham-infected mice. TLR4A could have promise as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment or prevention of bacterial-induced preterm birth.",

        "Title": "FadA from Fusobacterium nucleatum utilizes both secreted and nonsecreted forms for functional oligomerization for attachment and invasion of host cells.",
        "Abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobe associated with various human infections, including periodontal diseases and preterm birth. A novel FadA adhesin was recently identified for host-cell binding. It consists of 129 amino acid residues, with an 18-amino acid signal peptide. Expression of FadA in Escherichia coli enhanced bacterial binding to host epithelial and endothelial cells. In both E. coli and F. nucleatum, FadA exists in two forms, the intact pre-FadA and the secreted mature FadA (mFadA), with pre-FadA anchored in the inner membrane and mFadA secreted outside the bacteria. Pre-FadA and mFadA formed high M(r) complexes. When each form was purified to a single species, mFadA was soluble at neutral pH, whereas pre-FadA was insoluble. Pre-FadA became soluble when mixed with mFadA or under acidic pH. When fluorescence-labeled mFadA alone was added to the epithelial cells, no binding was detected. However, when mixed with nonlabeled pre-FadA, binding and invasion of mFadA into epithelial cells was observed. FadA is a unique bacterial adhesin/invasin in that it utilizes its own two forms for both structural and functional purposes. The pre-FadA-mFadA complex is probably anchored in the inner membrane and protrudes through the outer membrane. Internalization of the pre-FadA-mFadA ensures invasion of the bacteria into the host cells.",

        "Title": "Sonoporation is an efficient tool for intracellular fluorescent dextran delivery and one-step double-crossover mutant construction in Fusobacterium nucleatum.",
        "Abstract": "Studies of microorganisms are often hindered by a lack of effective genetic tools. One such example is Fusobacterium nucleatum, a gram-negative anaerobe associated with various human infections, including those causing periodontal disease and preterm birth. The first double-crossover allelic-exchange mutant in F. nucleatum was recently constructed using sonoporation, a novel ultrasound-mediated intracellular delivery method, demonstrating potential for bacterial gene transfection. To better unveil its mechanism, the current study examines the factors affecting the outcome of sonoporation. Delivery of Texas Red-conjugated dextran into F. nucleatum by sonoporation was at least twice as efficient as that by electroporation, and sonoporation was nonbactericidal, unlike electroporation. The delivery efficiency was affected by the acoustic pressure amplitude, the duty cycle, and the quantity of microbubbles used to initiate cavitation but not by the pulse repetition frequency of ultrasound application. To examine the involvement of homologous recombination in sonoporation-mediated mutant construction, the highly conserved recA gene, which carried most of the consensus residues, including the P loop, was identified in F. nucleatum, and a double-crossover recA mutant of F. nucleatum 12230, US1610, was constructed by sonoporation. The mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to UV exposure compared with that of the wild type, indicating that the RecA function in F. nucleatum was conserved. Interestingly, US1610 was also sensitive to ultrasound treatment, suggesting the likely involvement of RecA in postsonoporation repair and survival. Since sonoporation has consistently generated one-step double-crossover mutants in F. nucleatum by use of intact suicide plasmids, this technology may be developed into an efficient tool for streamlining mutant construction in bacteria.",

        "Title": "Transmission of an uncultivated Bergeyella strain from the oral cavity to amniotic fluid in a case of preterm birth.",
        "Abstract": "Intrauterine infection is a recognized cause of preterm birth. The infectious organisms are believed to originate primarily from the vaginal tract and secondarily from other parts of the body. It is plausible that microbes in the oral cavity can be transmitted to the pregnant uterus. However, direct evidence supporting such a transmission is lacking. In this study, amniotic fluids of 34 pregnant women were examined by PCR using 16S and 23S rRNA universally conserved primers. Bacterial DNA was amplified from the only patient with clinical intrauterine infection and histologic necrotizing acute and chronic chorioamnionitis. One strain, Bergeyella sp. clone AF14, was detected and was 99.7% identical to a previously reported uncultivated oral Bergeyella strain, clone AK152, at the 16S rRNA level. The same strain was detected in the subgingival plaque of the patient but not in her vaginal tract. The 16S-23S rRNA sequence of clone AF14 matched exactly with the sequences amplified from the patient's subgingival plaque. These observations suggest that the Bergeyella strain identified in the patient's intrauterine infection originated from the oral cavity. This is the first direct evidence of oral-utero microbial transmission. The patient's periodontal health during pregnancy was unclear. She did not have detectable periodontal disease during postpartum examination. Bergeyella spp. had not been previously associated with preterm birth and were detected in subgingival plaque of women without clinical levels of intrauterine infection. Uncultivated species may be overlooked opportunistic pathogens in preterm birth. This study sheds new light on the implication of oral bacteria in preterm birth.",

        "Title": "Identification and characterization of a novel adhesin unique to oral fusobacteria.",
        "Abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative anaerobe that is prevalent in periodontal disease and infections of different parts of the body. The organism has remarkable adherence properties, binding to partners ranging from eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells to extracellular macromolecules. Understanding its adherence is important for understanding the pathogenesis of F. nucleatum. In this study, a novel adhesin, FadA (Fusobacterium adhesin A), was demonstrated to bind to the surface proteins of the oral mucosal KB cells. FadA is composed of 129 amino acid (aa) residues, including an 18-aa signal peptide, with calculated molecular masses of 13.6 kDa for the intact form and 12.6 kDa for the secreted form. It is highly conserved among F. nucleatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Fusobacterium simiae, the three most closely related oral species, but is absent in the nonoral species, including Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium naviforme, Fusobacterium russii, and Fusobacterium ulcerans. In addition to FadA, F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 and ATCC 49256 also encode two paralogues, FN1529 and FNV2159, each sharing 31% identity with FadA. A double-crossover fadA deletion mutant, F. nucleatum 12230-US1, was constructed by utilizing a novel sonoporation procedure. The mutant had a slightly slower growth rate, yet its binding to KB and Chinese hamster ovarian cells was reduced by 70 to 80% compared to that of the wild type, indicating that FadA plays an important role in fusobacterial colonization in the host. Furthermore, due to its uniqueness to oral Fusobacterium species, fadA may be used as a marker to detect orally related fusobacteria. F. nucleatum isolated from other parts of the body may originate from the oral cavity.",

        "Abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative anaerobe ubiquitous to the oral cavity. It is associated with periodontal disease. It is also associated with preterm birth and has been isolated from the amniotic fluid, placenta, and chorioamnionic membranes of women delivering prematurely. Periodontal disease is a newly recognized risk factor for preterm birth. This study examined the possible mechanism underlying the link between these two diseases. F. nucleatum strains isolated from amniotic fluids and placentas along with those isolated from orally related sources invaded both epithelial and endothelial cells. The invasive ability may enable F. nucleatum to colonize and infect the pregnant uterus. Transient bacteremia caused by periodontal infection may facilitate bacterial transmission from the oral cavity to the uterus. To test this hypothesis, we intravenously injected F. nucleatum into pregnant CF-1 mice. The injection resulted in premature delivery, stillbirths, and nonsustained live births. The bacterial infection was restricted inside the uterus, without spreading systemically. F. nucleatum was first detected in the blood vessels in murine placentas. Invasion of the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels was observed. The bacteria then crossed the endothelium, proliferated in surrounding tissues, and finally spread to the amniotic fluid. The pattern of infection paralleled that in humans. This study represents the first evidence that F. nucleatum may be transmitted hematogenously to the placenta and cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. The results strengthen the link between periodontal disease and preterm birth. Our study also indicates that invasion may be an important virulence mechanism for F. nucleatum to infect the placenta.",
