        "Title": "Terminological reaction.",
        "Abstract": "When the terminology services at our institution encountered the installation of a new multi-site laboratory information system (LIS), we pursued obtaining a regular dictionary feed to keep the central terminology up-to-date. What we didn't predict was the value added to the LIS implementation effort by a cooperative vocabulary strategy. In this report, we describe how preexisting terminology services were leveraged to facilitate the integration of 2 previously independent laboratories into a new cross-campus LIS.",
