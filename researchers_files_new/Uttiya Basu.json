        "Abstract": "Activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a key element of the adaptive immune system, required for immunoglobulin isotype switching and affinity maturation of B-cells as they undergo the germinal center (GC) reaction in peripheral lymphoid tissue. The inherent DNA damaging activity of this enzyme can also have off-target effects in B-cells, producing lymphomagenic chromosomal translocations that are characteristic features of various classes of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL), and generating oncogenic mutations, so-called aberrant somatic hypermutation (aSHM). Additionally, AID has been found to affect gene expression through demethylation as well as altered interactions between gene regulatory elements. These changes have been most thoroughly studied in B-NHL arising from GC B-cells. Here, we describe the most common classes of GC-derived B-NHL and explore the consequences of on- and off-target AID activity in B and plasma cell neoplasms. The relationships between AID expression, including effects of infection and other exposures/agents, mutagenic activity and lymphoma biology are also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "B cells undergoing physiologically programmed or aberrant genomic alterations provide an opportune system to study the causes and consequences of genome mutagenesis. Activated B cells in germinal centers express activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to accomplish physiological somatic hypermutation (SHM) of their antibody-encoding genes. In attempting to diversify their immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy- and light-chain genes, several B-cell clones successfully optimize their antigen-binding affinities. However, SHM can sometimes occur at non-Ig loci, causing genetic alternations that lay the foundation for lymphomagenesis, particularly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, SHM acts as a double-edged sword, bestowing superb humoral immunity at the potential risk of initiating disease. We refer to off-target, non-Ig AID mutations - that are often but not always associated with disease - as aberrant SHM (aSHM). A key challenge in understanding SHM and aSHM is determining how AID targets and mutates specific DNA sequences in the Ig loci to generate antibody diversity and non-Ig genes to initiate lymphomagenesis. Herein, we discuss some current advances regarding the regulation of AID's DNA mutagenesis activity in B cells.",

        "Abstract": "Whole-genome sequencing of longitudinal tumor pairs representing transformation of follicular lymphoma to high-grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (double-hit lymphoma) identified coding and noncoding genomic alterations acquired during lymphoma progression. Many of these transformation-associated alterations recurrently and focally occur at topologically associating domain resident regulatory DNA elements, including H3K4me3 promoter marks located within H3K27ac super-enhancer clusters in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. One region found to undergo recurrent alteration upon transformation overlaps a super-enhancer affecting the expression of the PAX5/ZCCHC7 gene pair. ZCCHC7 encodes a subunit of the Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation-like complex and demonstrated copy number gain, chromosomal translocation and enhancer retargeting-mediated transcriptional upregulation upon lymphoma transformation. Consequently, lymphoma cells demonstrate nucleolar dysregulation via altered noncoding 5.8S ribosomal RNA processing. We find that a noncoding mutation acquired during lymphoma progression affects noncoding rRNA processing, thereby rewiring protein synthesis leading to oncogenic changes in the lymphoma proteome.",

Using S9.6, a monoclonal antibody against RNA-DNA hybrids, accelerated the study of R-loop biology. An outpouring of recent studies has implicated various contributions of R-loop in physiological cellular functions. Earlier studies using nondenaturing sodium bisulfite probing also supported existence of DNA-RNA hybrids formation in mammalian cells. In activated B cells, RNA-DNA hybrids formation at IgH gene locus of B cells is crucial for class switch recombination that ensure the proper effector function of the antibody. Here, we describe the identification of R-loops associated with the IgH locus using RNA-DNA hybrid immunoprecipitation sequencing and nondenaturing sodium bisulfite probing. This will be helpful for future studies of R-loops status on whole genome as well as on IgH locus in B cells.",

        "Abstract": "Noncoding RNAs are exquisitely titrated by the cellular RNA surveillance machinery for regulating diverse biological processes. The RNA exosome, the predominant 3' RNA exoribonuclease in mammalian cells, is composed of nine core and two catalytic subunits. Here, we developed a mouse model with a conditional allele to study the RNA exosome catalytic subunit DIS3. In DIS3-deficient B cells, integrity of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus in its topologically associating domain is affected, with accumulation of DNA-associated RNAs flanking CTCF-binding elements, decreased CTCF binding to CTCF-binding elements and disorganized cohesin localization. DIS3-deficient B cells also accumulate activation-induced cytidine deaminase-mediated asymmetric nicks, altering somatic hypermutation patterns and increasing microhomology-mediated end-joining DNA repair. Altered mutation patterns and Igh architectural defects in DIS3-deficient B cells lead to decreased class-switch recombination but increased chromosomal translocations. Our observations of DIS3-mediated architectural regulation at the Igh locus are reflected genome wide, thus providing evidence that noncoding RNA processing is an important mechanism for controlling genome organization.",

Together with a combination of other B10 markers, CD9 can be used to distinguish both mature and immature B10 cells from nonregulatory B cells and support selective purification of B10 cells.

In all the above-mentioned mechanisms, SETX unwinds transcription complex-associated nascent RNA which is then degraded by the RNA exosome complex.

        "Abstract": "Much of the mammalian genome is transcribed, generating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can undergo post-transcriptional surveillance whereby only a subset of the non-coding transcripts is allowed to attain sufficient stability to persist in the cellular milieu and control various cellular functions. Paralleling protein turnover by the proteasome complex, lncRNAs are also likely to exist in a dynamic equilibrium that is maintained through constant monitoring by the RNA surveillance machinery. In this Review, we describe the RNA surveillance factors and discuss the vital role of lncRNA surveillance in orchestrating various biological processes, including the protection of genome integrity, maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, antibody-gene diversification, coordination of immune cell activation and regulation of heterochromatin formation. We also discuss examples of human diseases and developmental defects associated with the failure of RNA surveillance mechanisms, further highlighting the importance of lncRNA surveillance in maintaining cell and organism functions and health.",

        "Abstract": "The 'RNA world', in which RNA molecules stored information and acquired enzymatic properties, has been proposed to have preceded organism life. RNA is now recognized for its central role in biology, with accumulating evidence implicating coding and noncoding (nc)RNAs in myriad mechanisms regulating cellular physiology and disequilibrium in transcriptomes resulting in pathological conditions. Nascently synthesized RNAs are subjected to stringent regulation by sophisticated RNA surveillance pathways. In this review, we integrate these pathways from a developmental viewpoint, proposing RNA surveillance as the convergence of mechanisms that ensure the exact titration of RNA molecules in a spatiotemporally controlled manner, leading to development without the onset of pathological conditions, including cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The distribution of sense and antisense strand DNA mutations on transcribed duplex DNA contributes to the development of immune and neural systems along with the progression of cancer. Because developmentally matured B cells undergo biologically programmed strand-specific DNA mutagenesis at focal DNA/RNA hybrid structures, they make a convenient system to investigate strand-specific mutagenesis mechanisms. We demonstrate that the sense and antisense strand DNA mutagenesis at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and some other regions of the B cell genome depends upon localized RNA processing protein complex formation in the nucleus. Both the physical proximity and coupled activities of RNA helicase Mtr4 (and senataxin) with the noncoding RNA processing function of RNA exosome determine the strand-specific distribution of DNA mutations. Our study suggests that strand-specific DNA mutagenesis-associated mechanisms will play major roles in other undiscovered aspects of organismic development.",

Recent studies have indicated these eRNAs play a role in gene regulatory networks by controlling promoter and enhancer interactions and topology of higher-order chromatin structure. Misregulation of enhancer and promoter associated noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) could stabilize deleterious secondary DNA structures, noncoding RNA associated DNA/RNA hybrid formation, and promote collisions of transcription complexes with replisomes. It is revealing that many chromosomal aberrations, some associated with malignancies, are present inside enhancer and/or promoter sequences. Here, we expand on current concepts to discuss enhancer RNAs and enhancer transcription, and how enhancer transcription influences genomic organization and integrity.",

        "Abstract": "The eukaryotic RNA exosome is a well-conserved protein complex with ribonuclease activity implicated in RNA metabolism. Various families of non-coding RNAs have been identified as substrates of the complex, underscoring its role as a non-coding RNA processing/degradation unit. However, the role of RNA exosome and its RNA processing activity on DNA mutagenesis/alteration events have not been investigated until recently. B lymphocytes use two DNA alteration mechanisms, class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), to re-engineer their antibody gene expressing loci until a tailored antibody gene for a specific antigen is satisfactorily generated. CSR and SHM require the essential activity of the DNA activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Causing collateral damage to the B-cell genome during CSR and SHM, AID induces unwanted (and sometimes oncogenic) mutations at numerous non-immunoglobulin gene sequences. Recent studies have revealed that AID's DNA mutator activity is regulated by the RNA exosome complex, thus providing an example of a mechanism that relates DNA mutagenesis to RNA processing. Here, we review the emergent functions of RNA exosome during CSR, SHM, and other chromosomal alterations in B cells, and discuss implications relevant to mechanisms that maintain B-cell genomic integrity.",

        "Abstract": "As B cells engage in the immune response, they express activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to initiate the hypermutation and recombination of immunoglobulin genes, which are crucial processes for the efficient recognition and disposal of pathogens. However, AID must be tightly controlled in B cells to minimize off-target mutations, which can drive chromosomal translocations and the development of B cell malignancies, such as lymphomas. Recent genomic and biochemical analyses have begun to unravel the mechanisms of how AID-mediated deamination is targeted outside immunoglobulin genes. Here, we discuss the transcriptional and topological features that are emerging as key drivers of AID promiscuous activity.",

        "Abstract": "Regulatory B cells (Breg) have immune suppressive functions in various autoimmune/inflammation models and diseases and are found to be enriched in diverse B cell subsets. The lack of a unique marker or set of markers efficiently identifying Breg cells impedes detailed investigation into their origin, development, and immunological roles. Here, we perform transcriptome analysis of IL-10-expressing B cells to identify key regulators for Breg biogenesis and function and identify CD9, a tetraspanin-family transmembrane protein, as a key surface marker for most mouse IL-10(+) B cells and their progenitors. CD9 plays a role in the suppressive function of IL-10(+) B cells in ex vivo T cell proliferation assays through a mechanism that is dependent upon B/T cell interactions. CD9(+) B cells also demonstrate inhibition of Th1-mediated contact hypersensitivity in an in vivo model system. Taken together, our findings implicate CD9 in the immunosuppressive activity of regulatory B cells.",

        "Abstract": "The immunoglobulin diversification processes of somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination critically rely on transcription-coupled targeting of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to Ig loci in activated B lymphocytes. AID catalyzes deamination of cytidine deoxynucleotides on exposed single-stranded DNA. In addition to driving immunoglobulin diversity, promiscuous targeting of AID mutagenic activity poses a deleterious threat to genomic stability. Recent genome-wide studies have uncovered pervasive AID activity throughout the B cell genome. It is increasingly apparent that AID activity is frequently targeted to genomic loci undergoing early transcription termination where RNA exosome promotes the resolution of stalled transcription complexes via cotranscriptional RNA degradation mechanisms. Here, we review aspects and consequences of eukaryotic transcription that lead to early termination, RNA exosome recruitment, and ultimately targeting of AID mutagenic activity.",

Unexpectedly, eRNA-expressing regions accumulate R-loop structures upon RNA exosome ablation, thus demonstrating the role of RNA exosome in resolving deleterious DNA/RNA hybrids arising from active enhancers. We have uncovered a distal divergent eRNA-expressing element (lncRNA-CSR) engaged in long-range DNA interactions and regulating IgH 3' regulatory region super-enhancer function. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ablation of lncRNA-CSR transcription decreases its chromosomal looping-mediated association with the IgH 3' regulatory region super-enhancer and leads to decreased class switch recombination efficiency. We propose that the RNA exosome protects divergently transcribed lncRNA expressing enhancers by resolving deleterious transcription-coupled secondary DNA structures, while also regulating long-range super-enhancer chromosomal interactions important for cellular function.",

        "Title": "Noncoding RNA transcription targets AID to divergently transcribed loci in B cells.",
        "Abstract": "The vast majority of the mammalian genome has the potential to express noncoding RNA (ncRNA). The 11-subunit RNA exosome complex is the main source of cellular 3'-5' exoribonucleolytic activity and potentially regulates the mammalian noncoding transcriptome. Here we generated a mouse model in which the essential subunit Exosc3 of the RNA exosome complex can be conditionally deleted. Exosc3-deficient B cells lack the ability to undergo normal levels of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, two mutagenic DNA processes used to generate antibody diversity via the B-cell mutator protein activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). The transcriptome of Exosc3-deficient B cells has revealed the presence of many novel RNA exosome substrate ncRNAs. RNA exosome substrate RNAs include xTSS-RNAs, transcription start site (TSS)-associated antisense transcripts that can exceed 500 base pairs in length and are transcribed divergently from cognate coding gene transcripts. xTSS-RNAs are most strongly expressed at genes that accumulate AID-mediated somatic mutations and/or are frequent translocation partners of DNA double-strand breaks generated at Igh in B cells. Strikingly, translocations near TSSs or within gene bodies occur over regions of RNA exosome substrate ncRNA expression. These RNA exosome-regulated, antisense-transcribed regions of the B-cell genome recruit AID and accumulate single-strand DNA structures containing RNA-DNA hybrids. We propose that RNA exosome regulation of ncRNA recruits AID to single-strand DNA-forming sites of antisense and divergent transcription in the B-cell genome, thereby creating a link between ncRNA transcription and overall maintenance of B-cell genomic integrity.",

        "Abstract": "Programmed mutagenesis of the immunoglobulin locus of B lymphocytes during class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation requires RNA polymerase II (polII) transcription complex-dependent targeting of the DNA mutator activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). AID deaminates cytidine residues on substrate sequences in the immunoglobulin (Ig) locus via a transcription-dependent mechanism, and this activity is stimulated by the RNA polII stalling cofactor Spt5 and the 11-subunit cellular noncoding RNA 3'-5' exonucleolytic processing complex RNA exosome. The mechanism by which the RNA exosome recognizes immunoglobulin locus RNA substrates to stimulate AID DNA deamination activity on its in vivo substrate sequences is an important question. Here we report that E3-ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 destabilizes AID-associated RNA polII by a ubiquitination event, leading to generation of 3' end free RNA exosome RNA substrates at the Ig locus and other AID target sequences genome-wide. We found that lack of Nedd4 activity in B cells leads to accumulation of RNA exosome substrates at AID target genes and defective CSR. Taken together, our study links noncoding RNA processing following RNA polII pausing with regulation of the mutator AID protein. Our study also identifies Nedd4 as a regulator of noncoding RNAs that are generated by stalled RNA polII genome-wide.",

        "Title": "Recombinant retroviral production and infection of B cells.",
        "Abstract": "The transgenic expression of genes in eukaryotic cells is a powerful reverse genetic approach in which a gene of interest is expressed under the control of a heterologous expression system to facilitate the analysis of the resulting phenotype. This approach can be used to express a gene that is not normally found in the organism, to express a mutant form of a gene product, or to over-express a dominant-negative form of the gene product. It is particularly useful in the study of the hematopoietic system, where transcriptional regulation is a major control mechanism in the development and differentiation of B cells, reviewed. Mouse genetics is a powerful tool for the study of human genes and diseases. A comparative analysis of the mouse and human genome reveals conservation of synteny in over 90% of the genome. Also, much of the technology used in mouse models is applicable to the study of human genes, for example, gene disruptions and allelic replacement. However, the creation of a transgenic mouse requires a great deal of resources of both a financial and technical nature. Several projects have begun to compile libraries of knock out mouse strains (KOMP, EUCOMM, NorCOMM) or mutagenesis induced strains (RIKEN), which require large-scale efforts and collaboration. Therefore, it is desirable to first study the phenotype of a desired gene in a cell culture model of primary cells before progressing to a mouse model. Retroviral DNA integrates into the host DNA, preferably within or near transcription units or CpG islands, resulting in stable and heritable expression of the packaged gene of interest while avoiding transcriptional silencing. The genes are then transcribed under the control of a high efficiency retroviral promoter, resulting in a high efficiency of transcription and protein production. Therefore, retroviral expression can be used with cells that are difficult to transfect, provided the cells are in an active state during mitosis. Because the structural genes of the virus are contained within the packaging cell line, the expression vectors used to clone the gene of interest contain no structural genes of the virus, which both eliminates the possibility of viral revertants and increases the safety of working with viral supernatants as no infectious virions are produced. Here we present a protocol for recombinant retroviral production and subsequent infection of splenic B cells. After isolation, the cultured splenic cells are stimulated with Th derived lymphokines and anti-CD40, which induces a burst of B cell proliferation and differentiation. This protocol is ideal for the study of events occurring late in B cell development and differentiation, as B cells are isolated from the spleen following initial hematopoietic events but prior to antigenic stimulation to induce plasmacytic differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR) and Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) in B lymphocytes by deaminating cytidines on template and nontemplate strands of transcribed DNA substrates. However, the mechanism of AID access to the template DNA strand, particularly when hybridized to a nascent RNA transcript, has been an enigma. We now implicate the RNA exosome, a cellular RNA-processing/degradation complex, in targeting AID to both DNA strands. In B lineage cells activated for CSR, the RNA exosome associates with AID, accumulates on IgH switch regions in an AID-dependent fashion, and is required for optimal CSR. Moreover, both the cellular RNA exosome complex and a recombinant RNA exosome core complex impart robust AID- and transcription-dependent DNA deamination of both strands of transcribed SHM substrates in vitro. Our findings reveal a role for noncoding RNA surveillance machinery in generating antibody diversity.",

        "Abstract": "Human and mouse Ig genes are diversified in mature B-cells by distinct processes known as Ig heavy-chain CSR (class switch recombination) and Ig variable-region exon SHM (somatic hypermutation). These DNA-modification processes are initiated by AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase), a DNA cytidine deaminase predominantly expressed in activated B-cells. AID is post-transcriptionally regulated via multiple mechanisms, including microRNA regulation, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Among these regulatory processes, AID phosphorylation at Ser(38) has been a focus of particularly intense study and debate. In the present paper, we discuss recent biochemical and mouse genetic studies that begin to elucidate the functional significance of AID Ser(38) phosphorylation in the context of the evolution of this mode of AID regulation and the potential roles that it may play in activated B-cells during a normal immune response.",

        "Title": "Integrity of the AID serine-38 phosphorylation site is critical for class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation in mice.",
        "Abstract": "Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a single-stranded (ss) DNA-specific cytidine deaminase that initiates Ig heavy chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR) and Ig somatic hypermutation (SHM) by deaminating cytidines within, respectively, IgH switch (S) regions and Ig variable region (V) exons. AID that is phosphorylated on serine residue 38 interacts with replication protein A (RPA), a ssDNA binding protein, to promote deamination of transcribed double-stranded DNA in vitro, which, along with other evidence, suggests that AID may similarly gain access to transcribed S regions and V exons in vivo. However, the physiological role of AID phosphorylation at serine residue 38 (S38), and even the requirement for the S38 residue, with respect to CSR or SHM has been debated. To address this issue, we used gene targeting to generate an endogenous mouse AID locus that produces AID in which S38 is substituted with alanine (AID(S38A)), a mutant form of AID that retains similar catalytic activity on ssDNA as WT AID (AID(WT)). B cells homozygous for the AID(S38A) mutation show substantially impaired CSR and SHM, correlating with inability of AID(S38A) to interact with endogenous RPA. Moreover, mice haploinsufficient for AID(S38A) have even more severely impaired CSR when compared with mice haploinsufficient for AID(WT), with CSR levels reduced to nearly background levels. These results unequivocally demonstrate that integrity of the AID S38 phosphorylation site is required for normal CSR and SHM in mice and strongly support a role for AID phosphorylation at S38 and RPA interaction in regulating CSR and SHM.",

AID is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation at multiple sites, although functional significance during CSR has been implicated only for phosphorylation at serine-38 (S38). Although multiple laboratories have demonstrated that AID function is regulated via phosphorylation at S38, the precise biological role of S38 phosphorylation has been a topic of debate.

Mouse AID (mAID) interaction with RPA and transcription-dependent dsDNA deamination in vitro requires protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation at serine 38 (S38), and normal mAID CSR activity depends on S38. However, zebrafish AID (zAID) catalyzes robust CSR in mouse cells despite lacking an S38-equivalent PKA site. Here, we show that aspartate 44 (D44) in zAID provides similar in vitro and in vivo functionality as mAID S38 phosphorylation. Moreover, introduction of a PKA site into a zAID D44 mutant made it PKA dependent for in vitro activities and restored normal CSR activity. Based on these findings, we generated mAID mutants that similarly function independently of S38 phosphorylation. Comparison of bony fish versus amphibian and mammalian AIDs suggests evolutionary divergence from constitutive to PKA-regulated RPA/AID interaction.",

        "Abstract": "The biosynthesis of 60 S ribosomal subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires Tif6p, the yeast homologue of mammalian eIF6. This protein is necessary for the formation of 60 S ribosomal subunits because it is essential for the processing of 35 S pre-rRNA to the mature 25 S and 5.8 S rRNAs. In the present work, using molecular genetic and biochemical analyses, we show that Hrr25p, an isoform of yeast casein kinase I, phosphorylates Tif6p both in vitro and in vivo. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of in vitro phosphorylated Tif6p by Hrr25p and (32)P-labeled Tif6p isolated from yeast cells followed by mass spectrometric analysis revealed that phosphorylation occurred on a single tryptic peptide at Ser-174. Sucrose gradient fractionation and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that a small but significant fraction of Hrr25p is bound to 66 S preribosomal particles that also contain bound Tif6p. Depletion of Hrr25p from a conditional yeast mutant that fails to phosphorylate Tif6p was unable to process pre-rRNAs efficiently, resulting in significant reduction in the formation of 25 S rRNA. These results along with our previous observations that phosphorylatable Ser-174 is required for yeast cell growth and viability, suggest that Hrr25p-mediated phosphorylation of Tif6p plays a critical role in the biogenesis of 60 S ribosomal subunits in yeast cells.",

        "Title": "Evolution of the immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch recombination mechanism.",
        "Abstract": "To mount an optimum immune response, mature B lymphocytes can change the class of expressed antibody from IgM to IgG, IgA, or IgE through a recombination/deletion process termed immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR). CSR requires the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which has been shown to employ single-stranded DNA as a substrate in vitro. IgH CSR occurs within and requires large, repetitive sequences, termed S regions, which are parts of germ line transcription units (termed \"C(H) genes\") that are composed of promoters, S regions, and individual IgH constant region exons. CSR requires and is directed by germ line transcription of participating C(H) genes prior to CSR. AID deamination of cytidines in S regions appears to lead to S region double-stranded breaks (DSBs) required to initiate CSR. Joining of two broken S regions to complete CSR exploits the activities of general DNA DSB repair mechanisms. In this chapter, we discuss our current knowledge of the function of S regions, germ line transcription, AID, and DNA repair in CSR. We present a model for CSR in which transcription through S regions provides DNA substrates on which AID can generate DSB-inducing lesions. We also discuss how phosphorylation of AID may mediate interactions with cofactors that facilitate access to transcribed S regions during CSR and transcribed variable regions during the related process of somatic hypermutation (SHM). Finally, in the context of this CSR model, we further discuss current findings that suggest synapsis and joining of S region DSBs during CSR have evolved to exploit general mechanisms that function to join widely separated chromosomal DSBs.",

        "Title": "The AID antibody diversification enzyme is regulated by protein kinase A phosphorylation.",
        "Abstract": "Antibodies, which are produced by B-lineage cells, consist of immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light (IgL) chains that have amino-terminal variable regions and carboxy-terminal constant regions. In response to antigens, B cells undergo two types of genomic alterations to increase antibody diversity. Affinity for antigen can be increased by introduction of point mutations into IgH and IgL variable regions by somatic hypermutation. In addition, antibody effector functions can be altered by changing the expressed IgH constant region exons through IgH class switch recombination (CSR). Somatic hypermutation and CSR both require the B-cell-specific activation-induced cytidine deaminase protein (AID), which initiates these reactions through its single-stranded (ss)DNA-specific cytidine deaminase activity. In biochemical assays, replication protein A (RPA), a ssDNA-binding protein, associates with phosphorylated AID from activated B cells and enhances AID activity on transcribed double-stranded (ds)DNA containing somatic hypermutation or CSR target sequences. This AID-RPA association, which requires phosphorylation, may provide a mechanism for allowing AID to access dsDNA targets in activated B cells. Here we show that AID from B cells is phosphorylated on a consensus protein kinase A (PKA) site and that PKA is the physiological AID kinase. Thus, AID from non-lymphoid cells can be functionally phosphorylated by recombinant PKA to allow interaction with RPA and promote deamination of transcribed dsDNA substrates. Moreover, mutation of the major PKA phosphorylation site of AID preserves ssDNA deamination activity, but markedly reduces RPA-dependent dsDNA deamination activity and severely impairs the ability of AID to effect CSR in vivo. We conclude that PKA has a critical role in post-translational regulation of AID activity in B cells.",

        "Abstract": "The synthesis of 60S ribosomal subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires Tif6p, the yeast homologue of mammalian eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6). In the present work, we have isolated a protein kinase from rabbit reticulocyte lysates on the basis of its ability to phosphorylate recombinant human eIF6. Mass spectrometric analysis as well as antigenic properties of the purified kinase identified it as casein kinase I. The site of in vitro phosphorylation, which is highly conserved from yeast to mammals, was identified as the serine residues at positions 174 (major site) and 175 (minor site). The homologous yeast protein Tif6p was also phosphorylated in vivo in yeast cells. Mutation of Tif6p at serine-174 to alanine reduced phosphorylation drastically and caused loss of cell growth and viability. When both Ser-174 and Ser-175 were mutated to alanine, phosphorylation of Tif6p was completely abolished. Furthermore, while wild-type Tif6p was distributed both in nuclei and the cytoplasm of yeast cells, the mutant Tif6p (with Ser174Ala and Ser175Ala) became a constitutively nuclear protein. These results suggest that phosphorylatable Ser-174 and Ser-175 play a critical role in the nuclear export of Tif6p.",
