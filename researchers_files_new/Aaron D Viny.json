        "Abstract": "Disordered chromatin organization has emerged as a new aspect of the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Characterized by lineage dysplasia and a high transformation rate to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the genetic determinant of MDS is thought to be the main driver of the disease's progression. Among the recurrently mutated pathways, alterations in chromatin organization, such as the cohesin complex, have a profound impact on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and lineage commitment. The cohesin complex is a ring-like structure comprised of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC), RAD21, and STAG proteins that involve three-dimensional (3D) genome organization via loop extrusion in mammalian cells. The partial loss of the functional cohesin ring leads to altered chromatin accessibility specific to key hematopoietic transcription factors, which is thought to be the molecular mechanism of cohesin dysfunction. Currently, there are no specific targeting agents for cohesin mutant MDS/AML. Potential therapeutic strategies have been proposed based on the current understanding of cohesin mutant leukemogenesis. Here, we will review the recent advances in investigation and targeting approaches against cohesin mutant MDS/AML.",

        "Abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an entity hallmarked by skewed hematopoiesis with persistent overrepresentation of cells from a common stem/progenitor lineage harboring single-nucleotide variants and/or insertions/deletions. CH is a common and age-related phenomenon that is associated with an increased risk of hematological malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. While CH is a term of the hematological aspect, there exists a complex interaction with other organ systems, especially the cardiovascular system. The strongest factor in the development of CH is aging, however, other multiple factors also affect the development of CH including lifestyle-related factors and co-morbid diseases. In recent years, germline genetic factors have been linked to CH risk. In this review, we synthesize what is currently known about how genetic variation affects the risk of CH, how this genetic architecture intersects with myeloid neoplasms, and future prospects for CH.",

        "Abstract": "Transcriptional regulators, including the cohesin complex member STAG2, are recurrently mutated in cancer. The role of STAG2 in gene regulation, hematopoiesis, and tumor suppression remains unresolved. We show that Stag2 deletion in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) results in altered hematopoietic function, increased self-renewal, and impaired differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing revealed that, although Stag2 and Stag1 bind a shared set of genomic loci, a component of Stag2 binding sites is unoccupied by Stag1, even in Stag2-deficient HSPCs. Although concurrent loss of Stag2 and Stag1 abrogated hematopoiesis, Stag2 loss alone decreased chromatin accessibility and transcription of lineage-specification genes, including Ebf1 and Pax5, leading to increased self-renewal and reduced HSPC commitment to the B cell lineage. Our data illustrate a role for Stag2 in transformation and transcriptional dysregulation distinct from its shared role with Stag1 in chromosomal segregation.",

STAG2 is the most commonly mutated cohesin member in AML as well as solid tumors. STAG2 is recurrently, mutated in Ewing's Sarcoma, bladder cancer, and glioblastoma, and is one of only ten genes known to be recurrently mutated in over four distinct tissue types of human cancer RECENT FINDINGS: The cohesin complex, a multiprotein ring, is canonically known to align and stabilize replicated chromosomes prior to cell division. Although initially thought to lead to unequal chromosomal separation in dividing cells, data in myeloid malignancies show this is not observed in cohesin mutant MDS/AML, either in large patient cohorts or mouse models. Mounting evidence supports a potential alternate mechanism whereby drivers of cell-type specific gene expression and hematopoietic development are impaired through alteration in three-dimensional nuclear organization and gene structure.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide profiling of histone modifications can provide systematic insight into the regulatory elements and programs engaged in a given cell type. However, conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) does not capture quantitative information on histone modification levels, requires large amounts of starting material, and involves tedious processing of each individual sample. Here, we address these limitations with a technology that leverages DNA barcoding to profile chromatin quantitatively and in multiplexed format. We concurrently map relative levels of multiple histone modifications across multiple samples, each comprising as few as a thousand cells. We demonstrate the technology by monitoring dynamic changes following inhibition of p300, EZH2, or KDM5, by linking altered epigenetic landscapes to chromatin regulator mutations, and by mapping active and repressive marks in purified human hematopoietic stem cells. Hence, this technology enables quantitative studies of chromatin state dynamics across rare cell types, genotypes, environmental conditions, and drug treatments.",

        "Abstract": "Cohesin complex members have recently been identified as putative tumor suppressors in hematologic and epithelial malignancies. The cohesin complex guides chromosome segregation; however, cohesin mutant leukemias do not show genomic instability. We hypothesized that reduced cohesin function alters chromatin structure and disrupts cis-regulatory architecture of hematopoietic progenitors. We investigated the consequences of Smc3 deletion in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Biallelic Smc3 loss induced bone marrow aplasia with premature sister chromatid separation and revealed an absolute requirement for cohesin in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. In contrast, Smc3 haploinsufficiency increased self-renewal in vitro and in vivo, including competitive transplantation. Smc3 haploinsufficiency reduced coordinated transcriptional output, including reduced expression of transcription factors and other genes associated with lineage commitment. Smc3 haploinsufficiency cooperated with Flt3-ITD to induce acute leukemia in vivo, with potentiated Stat5 signaling and altered nucleolar topology. These data establish a dose dependency for cohesin in regulating chromatin structure and HSC function.",

        "Abstract": "Somatic cohesin mutations have been reported in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To account for the morphologic and cytogenetic diversity of these neoplasms, a well-annotated cohort of 1060 patients with myeloid malignancies including MDS (n = 386), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) (n = 55), MDS/MPNs (n = 169), and AML (n = 450) were analyzed for cohesin gene mutational status, gene expression, and therapeutic and survival outcomes. Somatic cohesin defects were detected in 12% of patients with myeloid malignancies, whereas low expression of these genes was present in an additional 15% of patients. Mutations of cohesin genes were mutually exclusive and mostly resulted in predicted loss of function. Patients with low cohesin gene expression showed similar expression signatures as those with somatic cohesin mutations. Cross-sectional deep-sequencing analysis for clonal hierarchy demonstrated STAG2, SMC3, and RAD21 mutations to be ancestral in 18%, 18%, and 47% of cases, respectively, and each expanded to clonal dominance concordant with disease transformation. Cohesin mutations were significantly associated with RUNX1, Ras-family oncogenes, and BCOR and ASXL1 mutations and were most prevalent in high-risk MDS and secondary AML. Cohesin defects were associated with poor overall survival (27.2 vs 40 months; P = .023), especially in STAG2 mutant MDS patients surviving >12 months (median survival 35 vs 50 months; P = .017).",

        "Abstract": "In the last decade, genomic studies have identified multiple recurrent somatic mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Beginning with the discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation, multiple additional mutations have been found that constitutively activate cell-signaling pathways, including MPL, CBL, and LNK. Furthermore, several classes of epigenetic modifiers have also been identified, in patients with MPN, revealing a requirement for mutations in other pathways to cooperate with JAK-STAT pathway mutations in MPN pathogenesis. Mutations in the de novo DNA methylation protein, DNMT3A, demethylation machinery, TET2 and related IDH1/2 production of oncometabolite 2-hydroxygluterate, and polycomb complex proteins EZH2 and ASXL1 have opened new pathophysiologic clues into these diseases. The prognostic relevance of these novel disease alleles remains an important area of investigation, and clinical trials are currently underway to determine if these findings represent tractable therapeutic targets, either alone, or in combination with JAK2 inhibition.",

        "Abstract": "T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGL) is characterised by semiautonomous proliferation of monoclonal cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which can result in neutropenia, splenomegaly, and is associated with various autoimmune disorders, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. The coexistence of T-LGL leukemia with B cell abnormalities has previously been identified in case reports. However, no systematic analysis to determine the frequency of this co-association has been reported. Analysis of 63 T-LGL patients revealed a frequent association with humoral immune system abnormalities. We identified coexisting B cell dyscrasias in 17 T-LGL patients (27% of total), of whom 12 had monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) (19%), and 5 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (8%). The presence of both MGUS and CLL was found in 2 patients (3%) and follicular lymphoma was identified with MGUS in another T-LGL patient (2%). Additionally, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia was found in 10 additional LGL leukemia patients bringing the total frequency of B cell abnormalities in T-LGL leukemia to 43% in our cohort. The co-association of B cell pathology with T-LGL suggests that either a common antigen drives clonal B and T cells, or that humoral malignancy could serve as the stimulus for lymphocyte expansion representing an overactive anti-tumour surveillance.",
