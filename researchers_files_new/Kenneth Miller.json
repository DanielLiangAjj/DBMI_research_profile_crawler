        "Abstract": "Correlated variability in the visual cortex is modulated by stimulus properties. The stimulus dependence of correlated variability impacts stimulus coding and is indicative of circuit structure. An affine model combining a multiplicative factor and an additive offset has been proposed to explain how correlated variability in primary visual cortex (V1) depends on stimulus orientations. However, whether the affine model could be extended to explain modulations by other stimulus variables or variability shared between two brain areas is unknown. Motivated by a simple neural circuit mechanism, we modified the affine model to better explain the contrast dependence of neural variability shared within either primary or secondary visual cortex (V1 or V2) as well as the orientation dependence of neural variability shared between V1 and V2. Our results bridge neural circuit mechanisms and statistical models and provide a parsimonious explanation for the stimulus dependence of correlated variability within and between visual areas.",

        "Title": "The stabilized supralinear network accounts for the contrast dependence of visual cortical gamma oscillations.",
        "Abstract": "When stimulated, neural populations in the visual cortex exhibit fast rhythmic activity with frequencies in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials, which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column's receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model without retinotopy robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopic SSN which however lacks horizontal synaptic connections between its cortical columns. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and underlie contextual modulation effects such as surround suppression. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that retinotopic SSNs can account for both effects, but only when the horizontal excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component that only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.",

        "Abstract": "Sub-additivity and variability are ubiquitous response motifs in the primary visual cortex (V1). Response sub-additivity enables the construction of useful interpretations of the visual environment, whereas response variability indicates the factors that limit the precision with which the brain can do this. There is increasing evidence that experimental manipulations that elicit response sub-additivity often also quench response variability. Here, we provide an overview of these phenomena and suggest that they may have common origins. We discuss empirical findings and recent model-based insights into the functional operations, computational objectives and circuit mechanisms underlying V1 activity. These different modelling approaches all predict that response sub-additivity and variability quenching often co-occur. The phenomenology of these two response motifs, as well as many of the insights obtained about them in V1, generalize to other cortical areas. Thus, the connection between response sub-additivity and variability quenching may be a canonical motif across the cortex.",

The Hampton Veterans Affairs Medical Center's (HVAMC) rTMS clinic used H-coil for dTMS for Veterans with treatment-resistant depression and tracked symptomology at multiple times points up to six months post-treatment. Veterans underwent 30 session of dTMS treatment using the Hesed coil (H1 coil). The PHQ-9, PCL-5, and BSS were administered to Veterans at four time points: pretreatment, post-treatment, three months after treatment, and six months after treatment. In aggregate, there were clinically significant reductions in symptoms of depression (43.47%), PTSD (44.14%) and suicidal ideation (54.02%) at the six month follow-up relative to pretreatment. Results provide evidence of the impact and durability of dTMS on symptoms of MDD, PTSD, and suicidal ideation among Veterans with treatment-resistant depression.",

In a parallel trend, researchers have brought increased methodological rigour to their evaluation of these interventions. However, several methodological issues still constrain the quality and real-world relevance of the existing evidence base. We examine five core challenges in randomised controlled trials of mental health and psychosocial support interventions with conflict-affected and disaster-affected populations. These challenges are: translating intervention effects into metrics of real-world significance; giving adequate consideration to the selection and monitoring of control conditions; following rigorous processes to ensure outcome measures are culturally appropriate and psychometrically sound; ensuring and monitoring implementation variables, including fidelity, exposure, participant engagement, and the competence of implementation staff; and assessing mechanisms of change.",

In addition to changes in the ocean, vertical land motion (VLM) is a driver of spatial variation in sea level change that can either diminish or enhance flood risk. Here, we apply state-of-the-art interferometric synthetic aperture radar and global navigation satellite system time series analysis to estimate velocities and corresponding uncertainties at 30-m resolution in the New York City metropolitan area, revealing VLM with unprecedented detail. We find broad subsidence of 1.6 mm/year, consistent with glacial isostatic adjustment to the melting of the former ice sheets, and previously undocumented hot spots of both subsidence and uplift that can be physically explained in some locations. Our results inform ongoing efforts to adapt to sea level rise and reveal points of VLM that motivate both future scientific investigations into surface geology and assessments of engineering projects.",

        "Abstract": "Axonal transport is key to neuronal function. Efficient transport requires specific motor-cargo association in the soma, yet the mechanisms regulating this early step remain poorly understood. We found that EBP-1, the C. elegans ortholog of the canonical-microtubule-end-binding protein EB1, promotes the specific association between kinesin-3/KIF1A/UNC-104 and dense core vesicles (DCVs) prior to their axonal delivery. Using single-neuron, in vivo labeling of endogenous cargo and EBs, we observed reduced axonal abundance and reduced secretion of DCV cargo, but not other KIF1A/UNC-104 cargoes, in ebp-1 mutants. This reduction could be traced back to fewer exit events from the cell body, where EBP-1 colocalized with the DCV sorting machinery at the trans Golgi, suggesting that this is the site of EBP-1 function. EBP-1 calponin homology (CH) domain was required for directing microtubule growth on the Golgi, and mammalian EB1 interacted with KIF1A in an EBH-domain-dependent manner. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments suggest a model in which both kinesin-3 binding and guidance of microtubule growth at the trans Golgi by EBP-1 promote motor-cargo association at sites of DCV biogenesis. In support of this model, tethering either EBP-1 or a kinesin-3/KIF1A/UNC-104-interacting domain from an unrelated protein to the Golgi restored the axonal abundance of DCV proteins in ebp-1 mutants. These results uncover an unexpected role for a microtubule-associated protein and provide insights into how specific kinesin-3 cargo is delivered to the axon.",

        "Title": "The stabilized supralinear network accounts for the contrast dependence of visual cortical gamma oscillations.",
        "Abstract": "When stimulated, neural populations in the visual cortex exhibit fast rhythmic activity with frequencies in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials, which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column's receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model without retinotopy robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopic SSN which however lacks horizontal synaptic connections between its cortical columns. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and underlie contextual modulation effects such as surround suppression. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that retinotopic SSNs can account for both effects, but only when the horizontal excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component that only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who undergo lower extremity joint arthroplasty are rarely encountered. Patients with ALS are at an increased risk for perioperative anesthetic complications. Anesthetic techniques, regional or general, present different risks to patients with ALS. The historical concern of worsening pre-existing neurologic symptoms with regional anesthesia is being re-examined in light of emerging evidence supporting its use in patients with ALS. Here, we present the successful perioperative management of a patient with severe bulbar ALS undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Despite his advanced bulbar symptoms, he was independently ambulatory with severe knee pain related to osteoarthritis. During multidisciplinary planning with the patient and his wife, it became clear that his primary perioperative concern was avoiding intubation, prolonged ventilation, and tracheostomy placement. With this in mind, we planned for a neuraxial anesthetic without intraoperative sedation, a postoperative adductor canal peripheral nerve block, and multimodal non-opioid analgesia. There were no perioperative complications. At the six-week follow-up, he experienced improved ambulation and showed no signs of worsened ALS symptoms.",

        "Abstract": "Easy-to-use and inexpensive techniques are needed to determine the site-specific production of inflammatory mediators and neurotrophins during skin injury, inflammation, and/or sensitization. The goal of this study is to describe an epidermal-dermal separation protocol using thermolysin, a proteinase that is active at 4 °C. To illustrate this procedure, Sprague Dawley rats are anesthetized, and right hind paws are injected with carrageenan. Six and twelve hours after injection, rats with inflammation and naïve rats are euthanized, and a piece of hind paw, glabrous skin is placed in cold Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium. The epidermis is then separated at the basement membrane from the dermis by thermolysin in PBS with calcium chloride. Next, the dermis is secured by microdissection forceps, and the epidermis is gently teased away. Toluidine blue staining of tissue sections show that the epidermis is separated cleanly from the dermis at the basement membrane. All keratinocyte cell layers remain intact, and the epidermal rete ridges along with indentations from dermal papillae are clearly observed. Qualitative and real-time RT-PCR is used to determine nerve growth factor and interleukin-6 expression levels. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry are finally performed to detect amounts of nerve growth factor. This report illustrates that cold thermolysin digestion is an effective method to separate epidermis from dermis for evaluation of mRNA and protein alterations during inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Many studies have shown that the excitation and inhibition received by cortical neurons remain roughly balanced across many conditions. A key question for understanding the dynamical regime of cortex is the nature of this balancing. Theorists have shown that network dynamics can yield systematic cancellation of most of a neuron's excitatory input by inhibition. We review a wide range of evidence pointing to this cancellation occurring in a regime in which the balance is loose, meaning that the net input remaining after cancellation of excitation and inhibition is comparable in size with the factors that cancel, rather than tight, meaning that the net input is very small relative to the canceling factors. This choice of regime has important implications for cortical functional responses, as we describe: loose balance, but not tight balance, can yield many nonlinear population behaviors seen in sensory cortical neurons, allow the presence of correlated variability, and yield decrease of that variability with increasing external stimulus drive as observed across multiple cortical areas.",

        "Abstract": "Sickle cell hepatopathy is a well-described but uncommonly seen complication of sickle cell disease and is usually caused by multiple overlapping processes. A more acute liver complication is hepatic sequestration which is important to recognize in order to initiate life-saving treatment. A 33-year-old woman with sickle cell disease complicated by painful crises, splenic infarction and significant alcohol abuse presented with gastrointestinal distress, pain crisis, acute-on-chronic anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of greater than baseline alcohol consumption. She was found to have hepatomegaly, encephalopathy, severe jaundice, and severe hyperbilirubinemia. She was treated with red cell exchange and supportive care which resulted in an improvement in her symptoms as well as hyperbilirubinemia. She was discharged with plans for monthly red cell exchange, iron chelation therapy, and close monitoring of liver disease was planned upon discharge. This case illustrates that chronic liver disease can occur in sickle cell disease (Hgb SS) especially in the setting of acquired iron overload. More acutely, sequestration is a serious and life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease that can culminate in acute liver failure. Primary treatment for hepatic sequestration is red cell exchange along with management of contributing comorbidities, and symptomatic management of encephalopathy. In end-stage liver disease, transplantation may be considered in the context of the patient's clinical status.",

        "Abstract": "Pseudo-unipolar cell bodies of somatosensory primary neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The somatic and peripheral domains of DRG neurons are often studied in sensory pain research to understand molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of pain and maintenance of inflammation. Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) is an inflammatory model that elicits a robust and rapid onset immune response with a maximal swelling period of 24-48 h and persisting for several weeks. The AIA model in the hind paw of the rat elicits a potent inflammatory response of the dermis and epidermis, leading to protein expression changes for sensitization of many DRG neurons; however, it is unknown if the AIA model in the hind paw of the rat induces DRG neuronal injury, necrosis, or apoptosis at the somatic level. Neuronal nuclei (NeuN) antigen is a biomarker for post-mitotic neurons, neuronal identification, protein alterations, injury, and loss. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is expressed in C and Aδ DRG neurons, a subset of DRG neurons known to play a role in peripheral sensitization. The focus of this research was to evaluate the expression pattern of NeuN immunoreactivity, in size (soma) and CGRP subpopulations of DRG neurons in naïve and inflamed groups. Confirmed by both immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, DRG neuronal expression of NeuN was localized to nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular compartments. NeuN increased within the nucleus of small CGRP positive DRG neurons during inflammation, indicating a potential role for NeuN in a subset of nociceptive neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is related to an underlying condition in an estimated 50 to 60%, while the remaining is idiopathic, as a result of a combination of immune activation, deficiency, or dysregulation. AIHA is associated with viral infections, autoimmune disorders, immunodeficiencies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and pregnancy. AIHA has predictive properties and may be a harbinger of future lymphoproliferative disorders in up to 20% of AIHA cases. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) has been associated with lymphoproliferative disorders particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rarely is it seen in Hodgkin disease. In the following report, we describe the presentation of AIHA, ultimately resulting in the diagnosis of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma (stage III). From the limited reports and reviews available, it is understood that advanced Hodgkin (stage III or IV) of nodular sclerosis (NS) or mixed cellularity (MC) types portend a stronger affiliation to AIHA. The majority of AIHA-associated Hodgkin lymphoma presents as stage III or IV disease with the hemolysis being the presenting symptom, as in this case. The mainstay of AIHA therapy has been corticosteroids; however, this first-line regimen appears to be less effective when treating AIHA in the setting of HL. The exact mechanism of AIHA related to HL is unclear, and it may be thought to be that tumor cell produced autoantibodies. Other hypotheses include paraneoplastic phenomena or more, perhaps immunity to tumor cells may cross-react with antigens on the red cells.

        "Abstract": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a valuable tool in clinical and biological research for evaluating proteins and other antigens in spatially bound tissue. In neuroinflammatory pain research, primary afferent neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are studied to understand molecular signaling mechanisms involved in nociception (pain) and inflammation. Measuring IHC (immunofluorescence) in DRG neurons requires manual hand tracing of nuclear and somatic boundaries, which is laborious, error-prone, and may require several weeks to collect the appropriate sample size with a mouse or pen-input display monitor. To overcome these limitations and increase standardization of sampling and measurement, we employed a reliable neuronal cytoplasmic reporter, exclusive to DRG neuronal soma, in a semi-automated algorithm-based approach of Image Cytometry in rat DRG (IC-DRG). The resulting output images are binary nuclear and somatic masks of DRG neurons, defining boundaries of measurement for CellProfiler and manually scored at 94% accurate. Herein, we successfully show a novel approach of automated image analysis for DRG neurons using a robust ImageJ/FIJI script, overcoming morphological variability and imaging artifacts native to imaging frozen tissue sections processed with immunofluorescence.",

Primary treatment for ARDS is artificial mechanical ventilation (AMV) (Wu, Huang, Wu, Wang, & Lin, 2016).

Chemotherapeutic agents can result in DNA damage leading to clonal hematopoiesis, thereby causing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Alkylating agents and topoisomerase inhibitors are most frequently implicated in therapy-related MDS. We report four patients with gastropancreatic malignancies (two with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and two with gastric adenocarcinoma) who developed MDS during or after the treatment of their primary gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Two of these patients were diagnosed with MDS during maintenance therapy with ramucirumab. To our knowledge, development of MDS in association with ramucirumab has not been previously reported in the literature. Our findings also suggest that with continued improvement in survival of patients with GI and pancreatic malignancies, more cases of treatment-related MDS might be identified.",

        "Abstract": "Since my first exposure to the acronym 'QbD' more than ten years ago, I have been trying to understand exactly what QbD is and how I might incorporate its teachings into my twenty-odd years of experience developing transdermal systems. I feel I have made little progress since then. Eventually, I came to realize that while QbD has its merits, it is not a guide for (transdermal) product development, despite so often being described as such. Instead, I have come to consider QbD as a language useful for organizing and presenting the array of data supporting the approval of a new product, but it still leaves the experimental approach entirely up to the developer. What QbD does provide to the development community is a means of conveying product information through a consistent framework facilitating both internal and regulatory review. As a result, new 'QbD' product applications tend to be more uniform and complete than the applications that preceded the initiative.",

        "Abstract": "There is evidence that chronic stress negatively impacts parenting among refugees and other war-affected communities. Persistent parental stress and distress may lead to unresponsive, anxious, or overly harsh parenting and a corresponding increase in emotional and behavior problems among children. Most parenting interventions emphasize the acquisition of knowledge and skills; however, this overlooks the deleterious effects of chronic stress on parenting. The Caregiver Support Intervention (CSI) aims to strengthen quality of parenting skills by lowering stress and improving psychosocial wellbeing among refugee caregivers of children aged 3-12 years, while also increasing knowledge and skills related to positive parenting. The CSI is a nine-session psychosocial group intervention delivered by non-specialist providers. It is intended for all adult primary caregivers of children in high-adversity communities, rather than specifically targeting caregivers already showing signs of elevated distress.",

        "Abstract": "Given that pain relief is often the primary goal of orthopaedic surgery, an accurate assessment of pain is paramount. The objectives of this cross-sectional analytical study were to (1) compare how the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference (PI) computer adaptive test (CT) performs against the Numeric Pain Scale (NPS) measure in evaluating pain, and (2) to determine demographic, clinical, and psychosocial correlates of PI in an urban population undergoing a variety of knee surgeries. We hypothesized that there would be a strong correlation between PI and NPS, with minimal floor and ceiling effects; and that a worse PI score would be associated with a worse general health profile. The sample consisted of 412 patients undergoing knee surgery at an urban academic center. Patients were preoperatively administered measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Bivariate and multivariable statistical analyses were performed to identify significant independent predictors. The mean PI score was 60.3 ± 7.2 and had no floor or ceiling effects, whereas NPS demonstrated a greater percentage of patients scoring at the extremes of the measure. Worse PI scores were associated with older age, higher body mass index (BMI), greater comorbidity, lower income, smoking, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, Black race, unemployment, opioid use, lower expectations, and greater American Society of Anesthesiologists score (",

        "Abstract": "Synaptic vesicles (SVs) transmit signals by releasing neurotransmitters from specialized synaptic regions of neurons. In the synaptic region, SVs are tightly clustered around small structures called active zones. The motor KIF1A transports SVs outward through axons until they are captured in the synaptic region. This transport must be guided in the forward direction because it is opposed by the dynein motor, which causes SVs to reverse direction multiple times en route. The core synapse stability (CSS) system contributes to both guided transport and capture of SVs. We identified Sentryn as a CSS protein that contributes to the synaptic localization of SVs in ",

Here we use a deep convolutional neural network as a large-scale model of the visual system to address this question. We model the feature similarity gain model of attention, in which attentional modulation is applied according to neural stimulus tuning. Using a variety of visual tasks, we show that neural modulations of the kind and magnitude observed experimentally lead to performance changes of the kind and magnitude observed experimentally. We find that, at earlier layers, attention applied according to tuning does not successfully propagate through the network, and has a weaker impact on performance than attention applied according to values computed for optimally modulating higher areas. This raises the question of whether biological attention might be applied at least in part to optimize function rather than strictly according to tuning. We suggest a simple experiment to distinguish these alternatives.",

Five patients (83%) developed SCC of tongue and one developed esophageal SCC. Five patients had oral chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD). The conventional risk factors of alcohol, tobacco, and human papillomavirus were absent. The most common presenting finding was the new-onset focal oral pain and ulcerated plaques clinically indistinguishable from a flare of their oral cGvHD lesions. We demonstrated that the SCC in three patients was of donor origin.",

A screening magnetic resonance image of the patient's head demonstrated a new bilateral pituitary mass. Initial evaluation revealed low morning cortisol, and the patient was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency. His symptoms rapidly improved with maintenance glucocorticoids. Soon thereafter, the patient developed an acute visual deficit secondary to enlargement of the pituitary mass, and biopsy revealed EGFR T790M positive metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Hence, we present a rare case of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma to the pituitary causing secondary adrenal insufficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Correlated variability in cortical activity is ubiquitously quenched following stimulus onset, in a stimulus-dependent manner. These modulations have been attributed to circuit dynamics involving either multiple stable states (\"attractors\") or chaotic activity. Here we show that a qualitatively different dynamical regime, involving fluctuations about a single, stimulus-driven attractor in a loosely balanced excitatory-inhibitory network (the stochastic \"stabilized supralinear network\"), best explains these modulations. Given the supralinear input/output functions of cortical neurons, increased stimulus drive strengthens effective network connectivity. This shifts the balance from interactions that amplify variability to suppressive inhibitory feedback, quenching correlated variability around more strongly driven steady states. Comparing to previously published and original data analyses, we show that this mechanism, unlike previous proposals, uniquely accounts for the spatial patterns and fast temporal dynamics of variability suppression. Specifying the cortical operating regime is key to understanding the computations underlying perception.",

        "Abstract": "For biotherapeutics and vaccines, potency is measured in a bioassay that compares the concentration-response curves of a new batch to that of a reference standard. Acceptable accuracy and precision of potency measurement is critical to the manufacturing of these products. These characteristics of a bioassay are typically assessed in a procedure that is carried out with samples spanning the acceptable range for the product. During early development, however, a full validation study such as that which is carried out in late development can be costly as it relates to the likelihood of eventual program success. For these reasons, the laboratory may look for alternative ways to ensure the validity of the bioassay across a range that will support product development. One such alternative combines information from a reduced procedure using only reference standard and 100% relative potency concentration-response data sets, together with computer simulation, to estimate missing relative potency values across the desired range. Fits to the reduced dataset provide estimates of bioassay model parameters such as those for an S-shaped potency assay that follows a four-parameter logistic relationship, along with estimates of their variance-covariance structure and independent experimental unit (e.g., well-to-well or animal-to-animal) errors. Using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling, the predictive distribution of the concentration-response data for the desired levels of relative potency is generated. Results from use of the reduced procedure are compared to results calculated from a full dataset in Monte Carlo simulation and in a motivating example.",

        "Abstract": "In the visual system, the response to a stimulus in a neuron's receptive field can be modulated by stimulus context, and the strength of these contextual influences vary with stimulus intensity. Recent work has shown how a theoretical model, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), can account for such modulatory influences, using a small set of computational mechanisms. Although the predictions of the SSN have been confirmed in primary visual cortex (V1), its computational principles apply with equal validity to any cortical structure. We have therefore tested the generality of the SSN by examining modulatory influences in the middle temporal area (MT) of the macaque visual cortex, using electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations. We developed a novel stimulus that can be adjusted parametrically to be larger or smaller in the space of all possible motion directions. We found, as predicted by the SSN, that MT neurons integrate across motion directions for low-contrast stimuli, but that they exhibit suppression by the same stimuli when they are high in contrast. These results are analogous to those found in visual cortex when stimulus size is varied in the space domain. We further tested the mechanisms of inhibition using pharmacological manipulations of inhibitory efficacy. As predicted by the SSN, local manipulation of inhibitory strength altered firing rates, but did not change the strength of surround suppression. These results are consistent with the idea that the SSN can account for modulatory influences along different stimulus dimensions and in different cortical areas.",

        "Abstract": "Little is known about the internal circuitry of the primate lateral intraparietal area (LIP). During two versions of a delayed-saccade task, we found radically different network dynamics beneath similar population average firing patterns. When neurons are not influenced by stimuli outside their receptive fields (RFs), dynamics of the high-dimensional LIP network during slowly varying activity lie predominantly in one multi-neuronal dimension, as described previously. However, when activity is suppressed by stimuli outside the RF, slow LIP dynamics markedly deviate from a single dimension. The conflicting results can be reconciled if two LIP local networks, each underlying an RF location and dominated by a single multi-neuronal activity pattern, are suppressively coupled to each other. These results demonstrate the low dimensionality of slow LIP local dynamics, and suggest that LIP local networks encoding the attentional and movement priority of competing visual locations actively suppress one another.",

        "Abstract": "Molecularly targeted anti-cancer therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment by improving both quality of life and survival in cancer patients. However, many of these drugs are associated with cardiovascular toxicities that are sometimes dose-limiting. Moreover, the long-term cardiovascular consequences of these drugs, some of which are used chronically, are not yet known. Although the scope and mechanisms of the cardiac toxicities are better defined, the mechanisms for vascular toxicities are only beginning to be elucidated. This review summarizes what is known about the vascular adverse events associated with three classes of novel anti-cancer therapies: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, breakpoint cluster-Abelson (BCR-ABL) kinase inhibitors used to treat chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) used in myeloma therapeutics. Three of the best described vascular toxicities are reviewed including hypertension, increased risk of acute cardiovascular ischaemic events and arteriovenous thrombosis. The available data regarding the mechanism by which each therapy causes vascular complication are summarized. When data are limited, potential mechanisms are inferred from the known effects of inhibiting each target on vascular cell function and disease. Enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms of vascular side effects of targeted cancer therapy is necessary to effectively manage cancer patients and to design safer targeted cancer therapies for the future.",

        "Title": "Characterization of glutamatergic neurons in the rat atrial intrinsic cardiac ganglia that project to the cardiac ventricular wall.",
        "Abstract": "The intrinsic cardiac nervous system modulates cardiac function by acting as an integration site for regulating autonomic efferent cardiac output. This intrinsic system is proposed to be composed of a short cardio-cardiac feedback control loop within the cardiac innervation hierarchy. For example, electrophysiological studies have postulated the presence of sensory neurons in intrinsic cardiac ganglia (ICG) for regional cardiac control. There is still a knowledge gap, however, about the anatomical location and neurochemical phenotype of sensory neurons inside ICG. In the present study, rat ICG neurons were characterized neurochemically with immunohistochemistry using glutamatergic markers: vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (VGLUT1; VGLUT2), and glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme essential for glutamate production. Glutamatergic neurons (VGLUT1/VGLUT2/GLS) in the ICG that have axons to the ventricles were identified by retrograde tracing of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) injected in the ventricular wall. Co-labeling of VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and GLS with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) was used to evaluate the relationship between post-ganglionic autonomic neurons and glutamatergic neurons. Sequential labeling of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in adjacent tissue sections was used to evaluate the co-localization of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in ICG neurons. Our studies yielded the following results: (1) ICG contain glutamatergic neurons with GLS for glutamate production and VGLUT1 and 2 for transport of glutamate into synaptic vesicles; (2) atrial ICG contain neurons that project to ventricle walls and these neurons are glutamatergic; (3) many glutamatergic ICG neurons also were cholinergic, expressing VAChT; (4) VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 co-localization occurred in ICG neurons with variation of their protein expression level. Investigation of both glutamatergic and cholinergic ICG neurons could help in better understanding the function of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system.",

        "Abstract": "In neurons, a single motor (dynein) transports large organelles as well as synaptic and dense core vesicles toward microtubule minus ends; however, it is unclear why dynein appears more active on organelles, which are generally excluded from mature axons, than on synaptic and dense core vesicles, which are maintained at high levels. Recent studies in Zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that JIP3 promotes dynein-mediated retrograde transport to clear some organelles (lysosomes, early endosomes, and Golgi) from axons and prevent their potentially harmful accumulation in presynaptic regions. A JIP3 mutant suppressor screen in C. elegans revealed that JIP3 promotes the clearance of organelles from axons by blocking the action of the CSS system (Cdk5, SAD Kinase, SYD-2/Liprin). A synthesis of results in vertebrates with the new findings suggests that JIP3 blocks the CSS system from disrupting the connection between dynein and organelles. Most components of the CSS system are enriched at presynaptic active zones where they normally contribute to maintaining optimal levels of captured synaptic and dense core vesicles, in part by inhibiting dynein transport. The JIP3-CSS system model explains how neurons selectively regulate a single minus-end motor to exclude specific classes of organelles from axons, while at the same time ensuring optimal levels of synaptic and dense core vesicles.",

        "Abstract": "Research on the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children in conflict-affected settings has undergone a significant paradigm shift in recent years. Earlier studies based on a war exposure model primarily emphasized the effects of direct exposure to armed conflict; this has gradually given way to a broader understanding of the diverse pathways by which organized violence affects children. A robustly supported comprehensive model includes risk factors at multiple points in time (prior war exposure, ongoing daily stressors) and at all levels of the social ecology. In particular, findings suggest that material deprivation and a set of family variables, including harsh parenting, parental distress, and witnessing intimate partner violence, are important mediators of the relationship between armed conflict and children's wellbeing. To date, however, interventions aimed at supporting war-affected children's wellbeing, both preventive and treatment-focused, have focused primarily on direct work with children, while paying only modest attention to ongoing risk factors in their families and broader environments. Possible reasons for the ongoing prioritization of child-focused interventions are considered, and examples are provided of recent evidence-based interventions that have reduced toxic stressors (harsh parenting and the use of violent discipline by teachers) in conflict-affected communities.",

        "Abstract": "The idea that there is a fundamental cortical circuit that performs canonical computations remains compelling though far from proven. Here we review evidence for two canonical operations within sensory cortical areas: a feedforward computation of selectivity; and a recurrent computation of gain in which, given sufficiently strong external input, perhaps from multiple sources, intracortical input largely, but not completely, cancels this external input. This operation leads to many characteristic cortical nonlinearities in integrating multiple stimuli. The cortical computation must combine such local processing with hierarchical processing across areas. We point to important changes in moving from sensory cortex to motor and frontal cortex and the possibility of substantial differences between cortex in rodents vs. species with columnar organization of selectivity.",

        "Abstract": "Glutamate is a neurotransmitter used at both the peripheral and central terminals of nociceptive primary sensory neurons, yet little is known concerning regulation of glutamate metabolism during peripheral inflammation. Glutaminase (GLS) is an enzyme of the glutamate-glutamine cycle that converts glutamine into glutamate for neurotransmission and is implicated in producing elevated levels of glutamate in central and peripheral terminals. A potential mechanism for increased levels of glutamate is an elevation in GLS expression. We assessed GLS expression after unilateral hind paw inflammation by measuring GLS immunoreactivity (ir) with quantitative image analysis of L4 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after one, two, four, and eight days of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) compared to saline injected controls. No significant elevation in GLS-ir occurred in the DRG ipsilateral to the inflamed hind paw after one or two days of AIA. After four days AIA, GLS-ir was elevated significantly in all sizes of DRG neurons. After eight days AIA, GLS-ir remained elevated in small (<400 µm²), presumably nociceptive neurons. Western blot analysis of the L4 DRG at day four AIA confirmed the elevated GLS-ir. The present study indicates that GLS expression is increased in the chronic stage of inflammation and may be a target for chronic pain therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, produced by its synthetic enzyme, glutaminase (GLS), and packaged by vesicular transporters (VGluT2) into synaptic vesicles. Primary sensory peripheral nerve and spinal synaptic terminals release glutamate during nociceptive (pain) signaling. In post-incisional and inflammation models in rats, GLS and VGluT2 production is elevated in dorsal root ganglion neuronal cell bodies and transported to peripheral and spinal terminals for increased glutamate synthesis and release. 6-Diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) is a GLS inhibitor that produces long lasting pain relief when applied to the inflamed paw of arthritic rats, but its effect in a post-incisional model has not been evaluated. In this study, we examined the analgesic efficacy of DON in a surgical incision model by measuring thermal latency and mechanical allodynia. Following behavioral evaluation, we examined the skin for VGluT2, GLS and glutamate immunoreactivity (ir). Our findings revealed that VGluT2-ir is elevated in the stratum lucidum by approximately 19%, 64 hours post-surgical incision and attenuated by approximately 5.4% after the administration of DON. During that same period GLS-ir was elevated in dermal nerve fibers by 52% and was attenuated by approximately 27.9% after the application of DON. Additionally, glutamate-ir was elevated in epidermal nerve fibers by 35% after incision and attenuated by approximately 23% after the administration of DON. Behavioral testing 24 and 48 hours after a single local administration of DON showed five out of six animals having an analgesic response to mechanical allodynia, but not to thermal hyperalgesia. Following a surgical incision, the area of injury shows increased VGluT2-, GLS-, glutamate-ir, mechanical allodynia and no change in thermal latency. After the application of the GLS inhibitor, DON, nerve fiber of the skin showed decreased VGluT2, GLS, and glutamate-ir. Furthermore, post-incision DON treated animals exhibited decreased mechanical allodynia with no change in thermal latency when compared to control animals.",

        "Abstract": "The conserved protein UNC-16 (JIP3) inhibits the active transport of some cell soma organelles, such as lysosomes, early endosomes, and Golgi, to the synaptic region of axons. However, little is known about UNC-16's organelle transport regulatory function, which is distinct from its Kinesin-1 adaptor function. We used an unc-16 suppressor screen in Caenorhabditis elegans to discover that UNC-16 acts through CDK-5 (Cdk5) and two conserved synapse assembly proteins: SAD-1 (SAD-A Kinase), and SYD-2 (Liprin-α). Genetic analysis of all combinations of double and triple mutants in unc-16(+) and unc-16(-) backgrounds showed that the three proteins (CDK-5, SAD-1, and SYD-2) are all part of the same organelle transport regulatory system, which we named the CSS system based on its founder proteins. Further genetic analysis revealed roles for SYD-1 (another synapse assembly protein) and STRADα (a SAD-1-interacting protein) in the CSS system. In an unc-16(-) background, loss of the CSS system improved the sluggish locomotion of unc-16 mutants, inhibited axonal lysosome accumulation, and led to the dynein-dependent accumulation of lysosomes in dendrites. Time-lapse imaging of lysosomes in CSS system mutants in unc-16(+) and unc-16(-) backgrounds revealed active transport defects consistent with the steady-state distributions of lysosomes. UNC-16 also uses the CSS system to regulate the distribution of early endosomes in neurons and, to a lesser extent, Golgi. The data reveal a new and unprecedented role for synapse assembly proteins, acting as part of the newly defined CSS system, in mediating UNC-16's organelle transport regulatory function.",

        "Abstract": "The functional integrity of neurons requires the bidirectional active transport of synaptic vesicles (SVs) in axons. The kinesin motor KIF1A transports SVs from somas to stable SV clusters at synapses, while dynein moves them in the opposite direction. However, it is unclear how SV transport is regulated and how SVs at clusters interact with motor proteins. We addressed these questions by isolating a rare temperature-sensitive allele of Caenorhabditis elegans unc-104 (KIF1A) that allowed us to manipulate SV levels in axons and dendrites. Growth at 20° and 14° resulted in locomotion rates that were ∼3 and 50% of wild type, respectively, with similar effects on axonal SV levels. Corresponding with the loss of SVs from axons, mutants grown at 14° and 20° showed a 10- and 24-fold dynein-dependent accumulation of SVs in their dendrites. Mutants grown at 14° and switched to 25° showed an abrupt irreversible 50% decrease in locomotion and a 50% loss of SVs from the synaptic region 12-hr post-shift, with no further decreases at later time points, suggesting that the remaining clustered SVs are stable and resistant to retrograde removal by dynein. The data further showed that the synapse-assembly proteins SYD-1, SYD-2, and SAD-1 protected SV clusters from degradation by motor proteins. In syd-1, syd-2, and sad-1 mutants, SVs accumulate in an UNC-104-dependent manner in the distal axon region that normally lacks SVs. In addition to their roles in SV cluster stability, all three proteins also regulate SV transport.",

        "Title": "A Feminine Care Clinical Research Program Transforms Women's Lives.",
        "Abstract": "Feminine hygiene products and menstruation education have transformed the lives of women throughout the world. The P&G Feminine Care Clinical Innovation Research Program has played a key role by expanding scientific knowledge as well as developing technical insights and tools for the development of feminine hygiene products. The aim has been to meet the needs of women throughout their life stages, advancing their urogenital health beyond just menstruation, as well as helping to understand the role of sex hormones in various important health issues that women face. This review article highlights key contributions and research findings in female hygiene products, urogenital health research, and method development. The clinical research team focused on utilizing the results of clinical safety studies to advance the acceptance of feminine hygiene products world-wide. Key findings include that perception of skin sensitivity is not limited to the facial area, but is also relevant to the body and the genital area. Also, they shed light on the role of estrogen in autoimmune diseases as well as premenstrual syndrome. Efforts in the method development area focused on innovative tools that are reliable, predictive of clinical trial results and capable of measuring wear comfort, genital skin health, and the impact of product use on the consumer's quality of life. A novel method, behind-the-knee (BTK) test, developed to model irritation under normal wear conditions, was the first to account for both chemical and mechanical sources of irritation. The method has been accepted by the FDA as a substitute in clinical trials in some cases, and by American Society for Testing and Materials as a global standard test method. Additional proprietary methods were developed to enhance visual grading of irritation using cross-polarized light, to measure the amount of lotion transferred from sanitary pads, and to evaluate the skin mildness. Finally, the Farage Quality of Life tool was created to measure consumer's well-being. Based on the results of this extensive clinical research and the newly developed testing methods, the changing needs of women throughout their life stages are better met.",

        "Title": "Properties of networks with partially structured and partially random connectivity.",
        "Abstract": "Networks studied in many disciplines, including neuroscience and mathematical biology, have connectivity that may be stochastic about some underlying mean connectivity represented by a non-normal matrix. Furthermore, the stochasticity may not be independent and identically distributed (iid) across elements of the connectivity matrix. More generally, the problem of understanding the behavior of stochastic matrices with nontrivial mean structure and correlations arises in many settings. We address this by characterizing large random N×N matrices of the form A=M+LJR, where M,L, and R are arbitrary deterministic matrices and J is a random matrix of zero-mean iid elements. M can be non-normal, and L and R allow correlations that have separable dependence on row and column indices. We first provide a general formula for the eigenvalue density of A. For A non-normal, the eigenvalues do not suffice to specify the dynamics induced by A, so we also provide general formulas for the transient evolution of the magnitude of activity and frequency power spectrum in an N-dimensional linear dynamical system with a coupling matrix given by A. These quantities can also be thought of as characterizing the stability and the magnitude of the linear response of a nonlinear network to small perturbations about a fixed point. We derive these formulas and work them out analytically for some examples of M,L, and R motivated by neurobiological models. We also argue that the persistence as N→∞ of a finite number of randomly distributed outlying eigenvalues outside the support of the eigenvalue density of A, as previously observed, arises in regions of the complex plane Ω where there are nonzero singular values of L(-1)(z1-M)R(-1) (for z∈Ω) that vanish as N→∞. When such singular values do not exist and L and R are equal to the identity, there is a correspondence in the normalized Frobenius norm (but not in the operator norm) between the support of the spectrum of A for J of norm σ and the σ pseudospectrum of M.",

        "Abstract": "Neighboring neurons in cat primary visual cortex (V1) have similar preferred orientation, direction, and spatial frequency. How diverse is their degree of tuning for these properties? To address this, we used single-tetrode recordings to simultaneously isolate multiple cells at single recording sites and record their responses to flashed and drifting gratings of multiple orientations, spatial frequencies, and, for drifting gratings, directions. Orientation tuning width, spatial frequency tuning width, and direction selectivity index (DSI) all showed significant clustering: pairs of neurons recorded at a single site were significantly more similar in each of these properties than pairs of neurons from different recording sites. The strength of the clustering was generally modest. The percent decrease in the median difference between pairs from the same site, relative to pairs from different sites, was as follows: for different measures of orientation tuning width, 29-35% (drifting gratings) or 15-25% (flashed gratings); for DSI, 24%; and for spatial frequency tuning width measured in octaves, 8% (drifting gratings). The clusterings of all of these measures were much weaker than for preferred orientation (68% decrease) but comparable to that seen for preferred spatial frequency in response to drifting gratings (26%). For the above properties, little difference in clustering was seen between simple and complex cells. In studies of spatial frequency tuning to flashed gratings, strong clustering was seen among simple-cell pairs for tuning width (70% decrease) and preferred frequency (71% decrease), whereas no clustering was seen for simple-complex or complex-complex cell pairs.",

        "Abstract": "Neurons in sensory cortex integrate multiple influences to parse objects and support perception. Across multiple cortical areas, integration is characterized by two neuronal response properties: (1) surround suppression--modulatory contextual stimuli suppress responses to driving stimuli; and (2) \"normalization\"--responses to multiple driving stimuli add sublinearly. These depend on input strength: for weak driving stimuli, contextual influences facilitate or more weakly suppress and summation becomes linear or supralinear. Understanding the circuit operations underlying integration is critical to understanding cortical function and disease. We present a simple, general theory. A wealth of integrative properties, including the above, emerge robustly from four cortical circuit properties: (1) supralinear neuronal input/output functions; (2) sufficiently strong recurrent excitation; (3) feedback inhibition; and (4) simple spatial properties of intracortical connections. Integrative properties emerge dynamically as circuit properties, with excitatory and inhibitory neurons showing similar behaviors. In new recordings in visual cortex, we confirm key model predictions.",

Prevalent in certain countries of Africa and the Middle East, the practice continues among immigrants to industrialized countries. Female genital cutting is a deeply rooted tradition that confers honor on a woman and her family, yet also a traumatic experience that creates significant dermatological, gynecological, obstetric and infectious disease complications. Little is known about postmenopausal health in cut women. The international community views this practice as a human rights violation. In addition to genital health complications, the medical community must confront an understudied concern of what happens as this population ages.

        "Abstract": "Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, released by primary sensory peripheral nerve and spinal synaptic terminals during nociceptive (pain) signaling. The primary source of neurotransmitter, glutamate, is provided from its synthetic enzyme, glutaminase (GLS). Neurotransmitter glutamate is packaged into synaptic vesicles in nociceptive neurons by the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2). Little is known, however, what effect a surgical incision has on GLS and VGluT2 in primary afferent neurons. In this study, an aseptic, midline incision in the proximal one-third of the rat-tail was examined to determine whether sacral dorsal root ganglia innervate the area of surgical incision, utilizing the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold™. Subsequently, the amount of VGluT2 and GLS immunoreactivity (IR) in sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) was evaluated using immunofluorescence with image analysis and Western immunoblotting with density analysis. GLS messenger RNA (mRNA) changes were evaluated using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT",

        "Abstract": "Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity together refine neural circuitry, but their interactions are unclear. In most existing models, each form of plasticity directly modifies synaptic strength. Equilibrium is reached when the two are inducing equal and opposite changes. We show that such models cannot reproduce ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) because negative feedback from the slow homeostatic plasticity observed in ODP cannot stabilize the positive feedback of fast Hebbian plasticity. We propose a model in which synaptic strength is the product of a synapse-specific Hebbian factor and a postsynaptic-cell-specific homeostatic factor, with each factor separately arriving at a stable inactive state. This model captures ODP dynamics and has plausible biophysical substrates. We confirm model predictions experimentally that plasticity is inactive at stable states and that synaptic strength overshoots during recovery from visual deprivation. These results highlight the importance of multiple regulatory pathways for interactions of plasticity mechanisms operating over separate timescales.",

        "Abstract": "Earth's climate underwent a major transition from the warmth of the late Pliocene, when global surface temperatures were ~2° to 3°C higher than today, to extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation (NHG) ~2.73 million years ago (Ma). We show that North Pacific deep waters were substantially colder (4°C) and probably fresher than the North Atlantic Deep Water before the intensification of NHG. At ~2.73 Ma, the Atlantic-Pacific temperature gradient was reduced to <1°C, suggesting the initiation of stronger heat transfer from the North Atlantic to the deep Pacific. We posit that increased glaciation of Antarctica, deduced from the 21 ± 10-meter sea-level fall from 3.15 to 2.75 Ma, and the development of a strong polar halocline fundamentally altered deep ocean circulation, which enhanced interhemispheric heat and salt transport, thereby contributing to NHG.",

        "Abstract": "We examine the effects of short-term synaptic depression on the orientation tuning of the LGN input to simple cells in cat primary visual cortex (V1). The total LGN input has an untuned component as well as a tuned component, both of which grow with stimulus contrast. The untuned component is not visible in the firing rate responses of the simple cells. The suppression of the contribution of the untuned input component to firing rate responses is key to establishing orientation selectivity and its invariance with stimulus contrast. It has been argued that synaptic depression of LGN inputs could contribute to the selective suppression of the untuned component and thus contribute to the tuning observed in simple cells. We examine this using a model fit to the depression observed at thalamocortical synapses in-vivo, and compare this to an earlier model fit based on in-vitro observations. We examine the tuning of both the conductance and the firing rate induced in simple cells by the net LGN input. We find that depression causes minimal suppression of the untuned component. The primary effect of depression is to cause the contrast response curve to saturate at lower contrasts without differentially affecting the tuned vs. untuned components. This effect is slightly weaker for in-vivo vs. in-vitro parameters. Thus, synaptic depression of LGN inputs does not appreciably contribute to the orientation tuning of V1 simple cells.",

However, other sites of primary involvement do occur and can present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We present an unusual case of HCL involving predominantly the breast that was diagnosed as an incidental finding during an elective reduction mammoplasty in an otherwise healthy asymptomatic woman. Bone marrow performed for staging revealed limited involvement by HCL. Notably, there was no splenomegaly and/or involvement of other extramedullary sites. The peripheral blood revealed minimal involvement detected by flow cytometry. Extensive immunohistochemical studies supported by positive BRAF V600E mutational status confirmed the diagnosis of HCL. The patient remains asymptomatic without treatment one year following the diagnosis. This is the first case of a well-documented HCL presenting primarily in the breast in an asymptomatic patient. We review the literature on extramedullary, extrasplenic involvement by HCL and discuss the diagnostic challenges as well as the utility of immunohistochemistry and molecular studies in the diagnosis of atypical presentations of HCL.",

Just as the principles of the medical home have been an integral part of nurse practitioners' practice, so has the concept of whole person orientation incorporating both physical and mental or behavioral health care. It is therefore encouraging that organized medicine has embraced integrated physical and behavioral health care in patient-centered medical homes, a position that could help improve the wellbeing of patients all throughout the United States. Although the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) has long supported such integration, we do not support the physician-centric joint principles included in the current issue of Annals of Family Medicine (The Working Party Group on Integrated Behavioral Healthcare et al., 2014), as they create provider and leadership roles that are too narrow and restrictive for the provision of health care in the 21st century. As written, they limit access to high-quality care and restrict patient choice of health care providers.",

        "Abstract": "Many medial septal neurons of the basal forebrain are dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF) from the hippocampus for survival and maintenance of a cholinergic phenotype. When deprived of their source of NGF by axotomy, medial septal neuronal cell bodies atrophy and lose their cholinergic markers. This is similar to what is observed in the basal forebrain during Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, medial septal neurons were axotomized in female rats by way of a fimbria/fornix lesion. For fourteen days following axotomy, varying NGF doses (1 - 250 μg/ml) were administered to the lateral cerebral ventricle with either mini-osmotic infusion or daily injection. The responsiveness of medial septal neurons was evaluated with choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry. Within the mini-osmotic pumps, NGF activity diminished greatly during the first five days of implantation, but increased dramatically in the CSF after five days of infusion. The responsiveness of medial septal neurons to NGF was dose dependent and the ED",

        "Abstract": "Neurons release neuropeptides via the regulated exocytosis of dense core vesicles (DCVs) to evoke or modulate behaviors. We found that Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons send most of their DCVs to axons, leaving very few in the cell somas. How neurons maintain this skewed distribution and the extent to which it can be altered to control DCV numbers in axons or to drive release from somas for different behavioral impacts is unknown. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified loss-of-function mutations in UNC-43 (CaM kinase II) that reduce axonal DCV levels by ∼90% and cell soma/dendrite DCV levels by ∼80%, leaving small synaptic vesicles largely unaffected. Blocking regulated secretion in unc-43 mutants restored near wild-type axonal levels of DCVs. Time-lapse video microscopy showed no role for CaM kinase II in the transport of DCVs from cell somas to axons. In vivo secretion assays revealed that much of the missing neuropeptide in unc-43 mutants is secreted via a regulated secretory pathway requiring UNC-31 (CAPS) and UNC-18 (nSec1). DCV cargo levels in unc-43 mutants are similarly low in cell somas and the axon initial segment, indicating that the secretion occurs prior to axonal transport. Genetic pathway analysis suggests that abnormal neuropeptide function contributes to the sluggish basal locomotion rate of unc-43 mutants. These results reveal a novel pathway controlling the location of DCV exocytosis and describe a major new function for CaM kinase II.",

Although mortality from skin disease is primarily restricted to melanoma, dermatological disorders are ubiquitous in older people with a significant impact on quality of life. The structural and functional deterioration of the skin that occurs with age has numerous clinical presentations, ranging from benign but potentially excruciating disorders like pruritus to the more threatening carcinomas and melanomas.",

        "Title": "Thermal sensitivity of DASH interferometers: the role of thermal effects during the calibration of an Echelle DASH interferometer.",
        "Abstract": "The use of a Doppler asymmetric spatial heterodyne (DASH) interferometer with an Echelle grating provides the ability to simultaneously image the 558 and 630 nm emission lines (e.g., at grating orders of n=8 and n=7, respectively) of atomic oxygen in the thermosphere. By measuring the Doppler shifts of these lines (expected relative change in wavelength on the order of 10⁻⁸), we are able to determine the thermospheric winds. Because the expected wavelength changes due to the Doppler shift are so small, understanding, monitoring, and accounting for thermal effects is expected to be important. Previously, the thermal behavior of a temperature-compensated monolithic DASH interferometer was found to have a higher thermal sensitivity than predicted by a simple model [Opt. Express 18, 26430, 2010]. A follow-up study [Opt. Express 20, 9535, 2012] suggested that this is due to thermal distortion of the interferometer, which consists of materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion. In this work, we characterize the thermal drift of a nonmonolithic Echelle DASH interferometer and discuss the implications of these results on the use of only a single wavelength source during calibration. Furthermore, we perform a finite element analysis of the earlier monolithic interferometer in order to determine how distortion would affect the thermal sensitivity of that device. Incorporating that data into the model, we find good agreement between the modified model and the measured thermal sensitivities. These findings emphasize the fact that distortion needs to be considered for the design of thermally compensated, monolithic DASH interferometers.",

        "Abstract": "The indications for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) continue to expand. However, the risk for pulmonary complications post-HSCT continues to be high. Early recognition and treatment of pulmonary complications may improve outcomes. This is an overview of diagnosis, manifestations, and treatment of the most common infectious and noninfectious pulmonary complications post-HSCT. Knowing the patient's timeframe post-HSCT (preengraftment, postengraftment, late), type of HSCT (allogeneic vs autologous), radiographic findings, and clinical presentation can help to differentiate between the many pulmonary complications. This article will also address pretransplantation evaluation and infectious and noninfectious complications in the patient post-HSCT. While mortality post-HSCT continues to improve, respiratory failure continues to be the leading cause of ICU admissions for patients who have undergone HSCT. Mechanical ventilation is a predictor of poor outcomes in these patients, and further research is needed regarding their critical care management, treatment options for noninfectious pulmonary complications, and mortality prediction models posttransplantation.",

        "Abstract": "What causes critical periods (CPs) to open? For the best-studied case, ocular dominance plasticity in primary visual cortex in response to monocular deprivation (MD), the maturation of inhibition is necessary and sufficient. How does inhibition open the CP? We present a theory: the transition from pre-CP to CP plasticity arises because inhibition preferentially suppresses responses to spontaneous relative to visually driven input activity, switching learning cues from internal to external sources. This differs from previous proposals in (1) arguing that the CP can open without changes in plasticity mechanisms when activity patterns become more sensitive to sensory experience through circuit development, and (2) explaining not simply a transition from no plasticity to plasticity, but a change in outcome of MD-induced plasticity from pre-CP to CP. More broadly, hierarchical organization of sensory-motor pathways may develop through a cascade of CPs induced as circuit maturation progresses from \"lower\" to \"higher\" cortical areas.",

Nonetheless, palliative care services vary significantly between regions of the world and also between countries in the same region. Some common barriers to care include the lack of a trained workforce to provide palliative care, lack of availability of opioids or the restriction of their use, cultural attitudes of physicians and patients, and also funding. Despite these challenges, there are examples of low- and medium-resource countries that are providing excellent palliative care that is being integrated into the health care system and the cancer care continuum. This article provides an overview of the progress in providing palliative care in low- and medium-resource countries. In addition, more specific information is provided on palliative care in low-resource countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Finally, a more personal perspective is presented on the development of palliative care in Ethiopia, as an example.",

        "Abstract": "It is estimated that there are 13 million cancer survivors in the United States, and more than 65% of them are 5 or more years beyond their diagnosis. The majority are \"cancer-free and free of cancer,\" although some survivors have late or long-term effects of treatment or develop second or secondary cancers. Late and long-term effects for survivors of childhood cancers have been well studied, but less is known about the \"seasons of survivorship\" for adult cancer survivors. Symptoms during diagnosis, treatment, and then extending through the first several years of survivorship were reported in more than half of a large and heterogeneous group of cancer survivors. The incidence of late and/or long-term symptoms and health problems of long-term cancer survivors is less well characterized. These persistent symptoms are related to survivors' cancer diagnosis and the treatment they received, as well as age and other comorbidities. Health-related quality of life generally is stable for many years, although some cancer survivors experience a significant drop in health-related quality of life years after treatment, although the etiology is not clear yet. This article provides an overview of the natural history of cancer survivorship (\"The seasons of survivorship\"), disease-specific toxicities, and changes in symptoms in cancer survivors over time. Several common symptoms are used as examples including pain, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "We study a rate-model neural network composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in which neuronal input-output functions are power laws with a power greater than 1, as observed in primary visual cortex. This supralinear input-output function leads to supralinear summation of network responses to multiple inputs for weak inputs. We show that for stronger inputs, which would drive the excitatory subnetwork to instability, the network will dynamically stabilize provided feedback inhibition is sufficiently strong. For a wide range of network and stimulus parameters, this dynamic stabilization yields a transition from supralinear to sublinear summation of network responses to multiple inputs. We compare this to the dynamic stabilization in the balanced network, which yields only linear behavior. We more exhaustively analyze the two-dimensional case of one excitatory and one inhibitory population. We show that in this case, dynamic stabilization will occur whenever the determinant of the weight matrix is positive and the inhibitory time constant is sufficiently small, and analyze the conditions for supersaturation, or decrease of firing rates with increasing stimulus contrast (which represents increasing input firing rates). In work to be presented elsewhere, we have found that this transition from supralinear to sublinear summation can explain a wide variety of nonlinearities in cerebral cortical processing.",

        "Abstract": "Neurons must cope with extreme membrane trafficking demands to produce axons with organelle compositions that differ dramatically from those of the cell soma and dendrites; however, the mechanism by which they accomplish this is not understood. Here we use electron microscopy and quantitative imaging of tagged organelles to show that Caenorhabditis elegans axons lacking UNC-16 (JIP3/Sunday Driver) accumulate Golgi, endosomes, and lysosomes at levels up to 10-fold higher than wild type, while ER membranes are largely unaffected. Time lapse microscopy of tagged lysosomes in living animals and an analysis of lysosome distributions in various regions of unc-16 mutant axons revealed that UNC-16 inhibits organelles from escaping the axon initial segment (AIS) and moving to the distal synaptic part of the axon. Immunostaining of native UNC-16 in C. elegans neurons revealed a localized concentration of UNC-16 at the initial segment, although UNC-16 is also sparsely distributed in distal regions of axons, including the synaptic region. Organelles that escape the AIS in unc-16 mutants show bidirectional active transport within the axon commissure that occasionally deposits them in the synaptic region, where their mobility decreases and they accumulate. These results argue against the long-standing, untested hypothesis that JIP3/Sunday Driver promotes anterograde organelle transport in axons and instead suggest an organelle gatekeeper model in which UNC-16 (JIP3/Sunday Driver) selectively inhibits the escape of Golgi and endosomal organelles from the AIS. This is the first evidence for an organelle gatekeeper function at the AIS, which could provide a regulatory node for controlling axon organelle composition.",

        "Abstract": "Colposcopic inspection of the vagina is a routine component of the safety assessment of intravaginal products. However, colposcopic findings occur frequently in healthy women, raising questions about their relevance to intravaginal product safety. Practical disadvantages limit the utility of colposcopy for evaluating menstrual tampons, among them the presence of background microtrauma, the inability to assess effects during menstruation, and, importantly, the question of whether post hoc assessments are sufficiently sensitive to detect small inflammatory changes. The Behind-The-Knee (BTK) test is an alternative for evaluating inflammatory and tissue dryness effects of physical articles by their repeated application to the popliteal fossa under an elastic bandage. It enables concurrent parallel comparisons of experimental and control articles over time and substantially increases the sensitivity of detecting small changes in tissue inflammation.",

        "Title": "Glutaminase immunoreactivity and enzyme activity is increased in the rat dorsal root ganglion following peripheral inflammation.",
        "Abstract": "Following inflammation, primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) alter the production of several proteins. Most DRG neurons are glutamatergic, using glutaminase as the enzyme for glutamate production, but little is known about glutaminase following inflammation. In the present study, adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) was produced in rats with complete Freund's adjuvant into the hindpaw. At 7 days of AIA, DRG were examined with glutaminase immunohistochemistry, Western blot immunoreactivity, and enzyme activity. Image analysis revealed that glutaminase was elevated most in small-sized neurons (21%) (P < 0.05). Western blot analysis revealed a 19% increase (P < 0.05) in total glutaminase and 21% in mitochondrial glutaminase (P < 0.05). Glutaminase enzyme activity was elevated 29% (P < 0.001) from 2.20 to 2.83 moles/kg/hr. Elevated glutaminase in primary sensory neurons could lead to increased glutamate production in spinal primary afferent terminals contributing to central sensitization or in the peripheral process contributing to peripheral sensitization.",

        "Abstract": "The concept of targeting cancer therapeutics toward specific mutations or abnormalities in tumor cells, which are not found in normal tissues, has the potential advantages of high selectivity for the tumor and correspondingly low secondary toxicities. Many human malignancies display activating mutations in the Ras family of signal-transducing genes or over-activity of p21(Ras)-signaling pathways. Carcinoid and other neuroendocrine tumors have been similarly demonstrated to have activation of Ras signaling directly by mutations in Ras, indirectly by loss of Ras-regulatory proteins, or via constitutive activation of upstream or downstream effector pathways of Ras, such as growth factor receptors or PI(3)-kinase and Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinases. We previously reported that aberrant activation of Ras signaling sensitizes cells to apoptosis when the activity of the PKCδ isozyme is suppressed and that PKCδ suppression is not toxic to cells with normal levels of p21(Ras) signaling. We demonstrate here that inhibition of PKCδ by a number of independent means, including genetic mechanisms (shRNA) or small-molecule inhibitors, is able to efficiently and selectively repress the growth of human neuroendocrine cell lines derived from bronchopulmonary, foregut, or hindgut tumors. PKCδ inhibition in these tumors also efficiently induced apoptosis. Exposure to small-molecule inhibitors of PKCδ over a period of 24  h is sufficient to significantly suppress cell growth and clonogenic capacity of these tumor cell lines. Neuroendocrine tumors are typically refractory to conventional therapeutic approaches. This Ras-targeted therapeutic approach, mediated through PKCδ suppression, which selectively takes advantage of the very oncogenic mutations that contribute to the malignancy of the tumor, may hold potential as a novel therapeutic modality.",

        "Abstract": "In addition to using glutamate as a neurotransmitter at central synapses, many primary sensory neurons release glutamate from peripheral terminals. Primary sensory neurons with cell bodies in dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia produce glutaminase, the synthetic enzyme for glutamate, and transport the enzyme in mitochondria to peripheral terminals. Vesicular glutamate transporters fill neurotransmitter vesicles with glutamate and they are shipped to peripheral terminals. Intense noxious stimuli or tissue damage causes glutamate to be released from peripheral afferent nerve terminals and augmented release occurs during acute and chronic inflammation. The site of action for glutamate can be at the autologous or nearby nerve terminals. Peripheral nerve terminals contain both ionotropic and metabotropic excitatory amino acid receptors (EAARs) and activation of these receptors can lower the activation threshold and increase the excitability of primary afferents. Antagonism of EAARs can reduce excitability of activated afferents and produce antinociception in many animal models of acute and chronic pain. Glutamate injected into human skin and muscle causes acute pain. Trauma in humans, such as arthritis, myalgia, and tendonitis, elevates glutamate levels in affected tissues. There is evidence that EAAR antagonism at peripheral sites can provide relief in some chronic pain sufferers.",

        "Abstract": "This report describes the development of a potency ELISA using a peptide derived from the motavizumab binding epitope of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F-protein. Motavizumab is an antibody therapeutic studied for the prevention of RSV disease. It binds to the RSV glycoprotein F (F-protein), blocking the ability of RSV to fuse with target cells. This binding is the basis for a potency ELISA, however, due to inefficient F-protein production, development of an alternative ligand for the potency ELISA was investigated. A series of synthetic peptides spanning the motavizumab epitope on F-protein were evaluated for motavizumab binding activity. A 26-mer peptide was identified with desirable motavizumab binding kinetics, as shown by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance. The peptide corresponds to a portion of the motavizumab binding domain on the F-protein, and is referred to as F-peptide. The binding of motavizumab to the F-peptide is used in a new motavizumab potency ELISA, which was shown to be robust and statistically comparable to the F-protein ELISA. In addition, based on a qualitative observation, this new ELISA may be able to detect motavizumab degradation with greater sensitivity compared to the F-protein ELISA.",

        "Abstract": "No international research community, cell biology included, can exist without an educational community to renew and replenish it. Unfortunately, cell biology researchers frequently regard their work as independent of the process of education and see little reason to reach out to science teachers. For cell biology to continue to prosper, I argue that researchers must support education in at least three ways. First, we must view education and research as part of a single scientific community. Second, we should take advantage of new technologies to connect the research laboratory to the classroom. Finally, we must take the initiative in defending the integrity of science teaching, particularly when education is under attack for political or religious reasons.",

        "Title": "Impact of fermentation, drying, roasting, and Dutch processing on epicatechin and catechin content of cacao beans and cocoa ingredients.",
        "Abstract": "Low molecular weight flavan-3-ols are thought to be responsible, in part, for the cardiovascular benefits associated with cocoa powder and dark chocolate. The levels of epicatechin and catechin were determined in raw and conventionally fermented cacao beans and during conventional processing, which included drying, roasting, and Dutch (alkali) processing. Unripe cacao beans had 29% higher levels of epicatechin and the same level of catechin compared to fully ripe beans. Drying had minimal effect on the epicatechin and catechin levels. Substantial decreases (>80%) in catechin and epicatechin levels were observed in fermented versus unfermented beans. When both Ivory Coast and Papua New Guinea beans were subjected to roasting under controlled conditions, there was a distinct loss of epicatechin when bean temperatures exceeded 70 °C. When cacao beans were roasted to 120 °C, the catechin level in beans increased by 696% in unfermented beans, by 650% in Ivory Coast beans, and by 640% in Papua New Guinea fermented beans compared to the same unroasted beans. These results suggest that roasting in excess of 70 °C generates significant amounts of (-)-catechin, probably due to epimerization of (-)-epicatechin. Compared to natural cocoa powders, Dutch processing caused a loss in both epicatechin (up to 98%) and catechin (up to 80%). The epicatechin/catechin ratio is proposed as a useful and sensitive indicator for the processing history of cacao beans.",

A sample of 427 Sri Lankan Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim youth (mean age = 14.5) completed a survey with measures of exposure to disaster-related stressors and daily stressors, psychological distress (posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety), and psychosocial distress. The results indicated that daily stressors significantly mediated relations between war- and tsunami-related stressors and psychological and psychosocial distress. Some daily stressors not directly related to disaster also predicted functioning. These results point to the need for policies and interventions that focus on reducing proximal daily stressors that are salient to Sri Lankan youth exposed to disasters.",

Results show that for the cocoa products studied, antioxidant activity, and flavan-3-ol levels are stable over typical shelf lives of one year under controlled storage and over 2 years in ambient storage in the laboratory. We also show that 80 year old cocoa powder and 116 year old cocoa beans still show very high levels of antioxidant activity and flavan-3-ol content.",

        "Title": "Peripheral inhibition of glutaminase reduces carrageenan-induced Fos expression in the superficial dorsal horn of the rat.",
        "Abstract": "In inflamed tissue, the levels of the excitatory amino acid glutamate are increased. Glutamate sensitizes peripheral axons of primary afferent neurons during inflammation leading to decreased firing threshold and hyperexcitability. One proposed source of glutamate is the primary afferent. Antagonizing glutamate receptors on peripheral axons of primary afferents during inflammation provides analgesia in animals and humans. The enzyme glutaminase is used by primary sensory neurons to convert glutamine to glutamate, and peripheral inhibition of glutaminase with 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) provides long-lasting analgesia during inflammation. In this study, we measured the effects of glutaminase inhibition on carrageenan-induced spinal Fos expression. Rats were given intraplantar injections of carrageenan and treated locally with either vehicle or DON. After 3h of inflammation, hind paw swelling and spinal expression of Fos were examined. CellProfiler was used to automate Fos nuclei counting in five laminar groupings in the spinal cord (I-II, III-IV, V-VI, VII-IX, X). Carrageenan increased hind paw thickness by approximately 70% and spinal Fos expression in superficial (I-II) and deep (V-VI) laminae by 10-fold and 5-fold, respectively. Treatment with DON reduced hind paw swelling by approximately 13% and suppressed Fos expression in the laminae I-II by approximately 54%, but not the deep laminae. Our results further support the notion of glutamate as a peripheral inflammatory mediator and indicate that glutaminase should be considered as a novel therapeutic target for treatment of inflammatory pain.",

        "Title": "Fixative composition alters distributions of immunoreactivity for glutaminase and two markers of nociceptive neurons, Nav1.8 and TRPV1, in the rat dorsal root ganglion.",
        "Abstract": "Most, if not all, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons use the neurotransmitter glutamate. There are, however, conflicting reports of the percentages of DRG neurons that express glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme that synthesizes glutamate, ranging from 30% to 100% of DRG neurons. Defining DRG neuron populations by the expression of proteins like GLS, which indicates function, is routinely accomplished with immunolabeling techniques. Proper characterization of DRG neuron populations relies on accurate detection of such antigens. It is known intuitively that fixation can alter immunoreactivity (IR). In this study, we compared the effects of five formaldehyde concentrations between 0.25% and 4.0% (w/v) and five picric acid concentrations between 0.0% and 0.8% (w/v) on the IR of GLS, the voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na(v)1.8), and the capsaicin receptor TRPV1. We also compared the effects of five incubation time lengths from 2 to 192 hr, in primary antiserum on IR. Lowering formaldehyde concentration elevated IR for all three antigens, while raising picric acid concentration increased Na(v)1.8 and TRPV1 IR. Increasing IR improved detection sensitivity, which led to higher percentages of labeled DRG neurons. By selecting fixation conditions that optimized IR, we found that all DRG neurons express GLS, 69% of neurons express Na(v)1.8, and 77% of neurons express TRPV1, indicating that some previous studies may have underestimated the percentages of DRG neurons expressing these proteins.

PNH is associated with thrombotic complications, which are the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Management of a pregnant woman with PNH remains a challenge due to high incidence of thrombotic complications and the difficulty of differentiating a PNH crisis from the complications of pregnancy. PNH is associated with an increased rate of premature labor and fetal loss. Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the terminal complement protein C5, has revolutionized treatment of PNH. However, the role of eculizumab in pregnancy is unclear. We review the current strategies for the management of pregnant women with PNH, underline the controversies and present our recommendations.",

        "Abstract": "This paper seeks to bridge the divisive split between advocates of trauma-focused and psychosocial approaches to understanding and addressing mental health needs in conflict and post-conflict settings by emphasizing the role that daily stressors play in mediating direct war exposure and mental health outcomes. The authors argue that trauma-focused advocates tend to overemphasize the impact of direct war exposure on mental health, and fail to consider the contribution of stressful social and material conditions (daily stressors). Drawing on the findings of recent studies that have examined the relationship of both war exposure and daily stressors to mental health status, a model is proposed in which daily stressors partially mediate the relationship of war exposure to mental health. Based on that model, and on the growing body of research that supports it, an integrative, sequenced approach to intervention is proposed in which daily stressors are first addressed, and specialized interventions are then provided for individuals whose distress does not abate with the repair of the social ecology.",

        "Abstract": "Despite a key role for dense core vesicles (DCVs) in neuronal function, there are major gaps in our understanding of DCV biogenesis. A genetic screen for Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with behavioral defects consistent with impaired DCV function yielded five mutations in UNC-108 (Rab2). A genetic analysis showed that unc-108 mutations impair a DCV function unrelated to neuropeptide release that, together with neuropeptide release, fully accounts for the role of DCVs in locomotion. An electron microscopy analysis of DCVs in unc-108 mutants, coupled with quantitative imaging of DCV cargo proteins, revealed that Rab2 acts in cell somas during DCV maturation to prevent the loss of soluble and membrane cargo. In Rab2 null mutants, two thirds of these cargoes move to early endosomes via a PI(3)P-dependent trafficking pathway, whereas aggregated neuropeptides are unaffected. These results reveal how neurons solve a challenging trafficking problem using the most highly conserved animal Rab.",

        "Title": "Survey of commercially available chocolate- and cocoa-containing products in the United States. 2. Comparison of flavan-3-ol content with nonfat cocoa solids, total polyphenols, and percent cacao.",
        "Abstract": "A survey of a broad range of chocolate- and cocoa-containing products marketed in the United States was conducted to provide a more detailed analysis of flavan-3-ol monomers, oligomers, and polymers, which can be grouped into a class of compounds called procyanidins. Samples consisted of the three or four top-selling products within the following six categories: natural cocoa powder, unsweetened baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized for percent fat (% fat), percent nonfat cocoa solids (% NFCS), antioxidant level by ORAC, total polyphenols, epicatechin, catechin, total monomers, and flavan-3-ol oligomers and polymers (procyanidins). On a gram weight basis epicatechin and catechin content of the products follow in decreasing order: cocoa powder > baking chocolate > dark chocolate = baking chips > milk chocolate > chocolate syrup. Analysis of the monomer and oligomer profiles within product categories shows there are two types of profiles: (1) products that have high monomers with decreasing levels of oligomers and (2) products in which the level of dimers is equal to or greater than the monomers. Results show a strong correlation (R(2) = 0.834) of epicatechin to the level of % NFCS and also very good correlations for N = 2-5 oligomers to % NFCS. A weaker correlation was observed for catechin to % NFCS (R(2) = 0.680). Other analyses show a similar high degree of correlation with epicatechin and N = 2-5 oligomers to total polyphenols, with catechin being less well correlated to total polyphenols. A lesser but still good correlation exists between the calculated percent cacao (calcd % cacao) content, a proxy for percent cacao, and these same flavanol measures, with catechin again showing a lesser degree of correlation to calcd % cacao. Principal component analysis (PCA) shows that the products group discretely into five classes: (1) cocoa powder, (2) baking chocolate, (3) dark chocolate and semisweet chips, (4) milk chocolates, and (5) syrup. PCA also shows that most factors group closely together including the antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and the flavan-3-ol measures with the exception of catechin and % fat in the product, which group separately. Because catechin distribution appears to be different from the other flavan-3-ol measures, an analysis of the epicatechin to catechin ratio was done, indicating there is a >5-fold variation in this measure across the products studied. The cocoa-containing products tested range from cocoa powder with 227.34 +/- 17.23 mg of procyanidins per serving to 25.75 +/- 9.91 mg of procyanidins per serving for chocolate syrup. These results are discussed with respect to other studies on commercial products, the bioavailability of the flavanols, and the possible role of processing on the amount of catechin in products.",

        "Abstract": "This phase 3 prospective randomized trial evaluated the efficacy and long-term safety of erythropoietin (EPO) with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus supportive care (SC; n = 53) versus SC alone (n = 57) for the treatment of anemic patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. The response rates in the EPO versus SC alone arms were 36% versus 9.6%, respectively, at the initial treatment step, 47% in the EPO arm, including subsequent steps. Responding patients had significantly lower serum EPO levels (45% vs 5% responses for levels < 200 mU/mL vs > or = 200 mU/mL) and improvement in multiple quality-of-life domains. With prolonged follow-up (median, 5.8 years), no differences were found in overall survival of patients in the EPO versus SC arms (median, 3.1 vs 2.6 years) or in the incidence of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (7.5% and 10.5% patients, respectively). Increased survival was demonstrated for erythroid responders versus nonresponders (median, 5.5 vs 2.3 years). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentage of P-glycoprotein(+) CD34(+) marrow blasts was positively correlated with longer overall survival. In comparison with SC alone, patients receiving EPO with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus SC had improved erythroid responses, similar survival, and incidence of acute myeloid leukemia transformation.",

        "Abstract": "This study examined the validity and utility of PTSD among 320 adults in Afghanistan. Findings support the validity of PTSD in this cultural context: PTSD symptoms were highly prevalent, shared common variance, and correlated as expected with exposure to traumatic stress. However, only limited support was found for the clinical utility of PTSD. Other types of psychiatric symptomatology, including depression and a culturally specific measure of general distress, correlated more highly with traumatic stress than did PTSD; and PTSD accounted for limited variance in functioning beyond that explained by depression and general distress. Implications for research and intervention are considered.",

        "Title": "Equalization of ocular dominance columns induced by an activity-dependent learning rule and the maturation of inhibition.",
        "Abstract": "Early in development, the cat primary visual cortex (V1) is dominated by inputs driven by the contralateral eye. The pattern then reorganizes into ocular dominance columns that are roughly equally distributed between inputs serving the two eyes. This reorganization does not occur if the eyes are kept closed. The mechanism of this equalization is unknown. It has been argued that it is unlikely to involve Hebbian activity-dependent learning rules, on the assumption that these would favor an initially dominant eye. The reorganization occurs at the onset of the critical period (CP) for monocular deprivation (MD), the period when MD can cause a shift of cortical innervation in favor of the nondeprived eye. In mice, the CP is opened by the maturation of cortical inhibition, which does not occur if the eyes are kept closed. Here we show how these observations can be united: under Hebbian rules of activity-dependent synaptic modification, strengthening of intracortical inhibition can lead to equalization of the two eyes' inputs. Furthermore, when the effects of homeostatic synaptic plasticity or certain other mechanisms are incorporated, activity-dependent learning can also explain how MD causes a shift toward the open eye during the CP despite the drive by inhibition toward equalization of the two eyes' inputs. Thus, assuming similar mechanisms underlie the onset of the CP in cats as in mice, this and activity-dependent learning rules can explain the interocular equalization observed in cat V1 and its failure to occur without visual experience.",

        "Abstract": "Signal-to-noise ratios in physical systems can be significantly degraded if the outputs of the systems are highly variable. Biological processes for which highly stereotyped signal generations are necessary features appear to have reduced their signal variabilities by employing multiple processing steps. To better understand why this multistep cascade structure might be desirable, we prove that the reliability of a signal generated by a multistate system with no memory (i.e., a Markov chain) is maximal if and only if the system topology is such that the process steps irreversibly through each state, with transition rates chosen such that an equal fraction of the total signal is generated in each state. Furthermore, our result indicates that by increasing the number of states, it is possible to arbitrarily increase the reliability of the system. In a physical system, however, an energy cost is associated with maintaining irreversible transitions, and this cost increases with the number of such transitions (i.e., the number of states). Thus, an infinite-length chain, which would be perfectly reliable, is infeasible. To model the effects of energy demands on the maximally reliable solution, we numerically optimize the topology under two distinct energy functions that penalize either irreversible transitions or incommunicability between states, respectively. In both cases, the solutions are essentially irreversible linear chains, but with upper bounds on the number of states set by the amount of available energy. We therefore conclude that a physical system for which signal reliability is important should employ a linear architecture, with the number of states (and thus the reliability) determined by the intrinsic energy constraints of the system.",

        "Abstract": "In cerebral cortex, ongoing activity absent a stimulus can resemble stimulus-driven activity in size and structure. In particular, spontaneous activity in cat primary visual cortex (V1) has structure significantly correlated with evoked responses to oriented stimuli. This suggests that, from unstructured input, cortical circuits selectively amplify specific activity patterns. Current understanding of selective amplification involves elongation of a neural assembly's lifetime by mutual excitation among its neurons. We introduce a new mechanism for selective amplification without elongation of lifetime: \"balanced amplification.\" Strong balanced amplification arises when feedback inhibition stabilizes strong recurrent excitation, a pattern likely to be typical of cortex. Thus, balanced amplification should ubiquitously contribute to cortical activity. Balanced amplification depends on the fact that individual neurons project only excitatory or only inhibitory synapses. This leads to a hidden feedforward connectivity between activity patterns. We show in a detailed biophysical model that this can explain the cat V1 observations.",

        "Title": "Clinical implications of aging skin: cutaneous disorders in the elderly.",
        "Abstract": "Aging skin undergoes progressive degenerative change. Structural and physiologic changes that occur as a natural consequence of intrinsic aging combined with the effects of a lifetime of ongoing cumulative extrinsic damage and environment insult (e.g. overexposure to solar radiation) can produce a marked susceptibility to dermatologic disorders in the elderly. As skin ages, the vasculature progressively atrophies. The supporting dermis also deteriorates, with collagen and elastin fibers becoming sparse and increasingly disordered. These changes leave the elderly increasingly susceptible to both vascular disorders such as stasis dermatitis and skin injuries such as pressure ulcers and skin tears, with a steadily decreasing ability to effect skin repair. A parallel erosion of normal immune function produces higher levels of autoimmune skin disorders such as bullous pemphigoid, benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, paraneoplastic pemphigoid, and pemphigus vulgaris. Lichen sclerosus, an autoimmune disorder often occurring in the genital area in older women, is not common but is an important development because of the potential for substantial discomfort as well as serious complications. The prevalence of polypharmacy in this population increases the risk for autoimmune drug reactions, and diagnosis should be undertaken with an awareness that polypharmacy in this population creates a greatly increased susceptibility to drug eruptions that can mimic other cutaneous disorders. Immunologic senescence in the elderly also sets the stage for potential reactivation of the Varicella zoster virus, in which initial dermatologic involvement expands into the major sensory ganglia. Known as shingles, this disorder can be excruciatingly painful with the potential to cause blindness if the optic nerve becomes involved. Dermatoses such as xerosis, pruritus, and eczema are also widespread in the elderly, create substantial suffering in those afflicted, and often prove recalcitrant to treatment. Individual susceptibility to specific types of contact dermatitis changes over the lifetime, and seborrheic dermatitis is substantially more prevalent in the elderly. It is not uncommon for older patients to have multiple impairments, with the potential for cognitive dysfunction as well as impaired vision, hearing, or mobility. In addition, they may not have adequate housing or nutrition, or the financial resources necessary for adequate compliance. Physicians must take into consideration the patient's physical ability to comply with the recommended therapy as well as socioeconomic factors that may impact on compliance. Simple topical regimens are preferable wherever possible in order to maximize compliance and, therefore, efficacy. Extra effort may be necessary to ensure that instructions are accurately followed and that ongoing compliance with the regimen prescribed is actually achieved. Management of dermatologic disorders in the elderly is often less than optimal, due to the fact that the special needs and limitations of this population are not adequately considered. Treatments should consider the intrinsic differences between younger and older patients that may impact on diagnosis and therapy choice. The aged patient is often afflicted with numerous co-morbidities that can influence the choice of therapy. Skin integrity in the elderly is compromised, and safety concerns are increased with the long-term use of any medication prescribed. In addition, the prevalence of polypharmacy in the aged population substantially increases the risk of cutaneous drug reactions, which can profoundly complicate accurate diagnosis of dermatologic disorders. The aged population also needs to be more closely monitored because of increased fragility of the skin and the physical limitations that may hinder compliance with prescribed regimens.",

While a significant number of naturally occurring substances are postulated to arise by biosynthetic Diels-Alder reactions, rigorous confirmation of a mechanistically distinct natural Diels-Alderase enzyme remains elusive. Within this context, several related fungi within the Aspergillus genus produce a number of metabolites of opposite absolute configuration including (+)- or (-)-versicolamide B. These alkaloids are hypothesized to arise via biosynthetic Diels-Alder reactions implying that each Aspergillus species possesses enantiomerically distinct Diels-Alderases. Herein, experimental validation of these biosynthetic proposals via deployment of the IMDA reaction as a key step in the asymmetric total syntheses of (+)- and (-)-versicolamide B is described. Laboratory validation of the proposed biosynthetic Diels-Alder construction, coupled with the secondary metabolite profile of the producing fungi, reveals that each Aspergillus species has evolved enantiomerically distinct indole oxidases, as well as enantiomerically distinct Diels-Alderases.",

        "Abstract": "Working in Afghanistan's capital city of Kabul, the authors assessed the relative contribution of daily stressors and war-related experiences of violence and loss to levels of depression, PTSD, impaired functioning, and a culturally specific measure of general psychological distress. For women, daily stressors were a better predictor than war experiences of all mental health outcomes except for PTSD; for men, daily stressors were a better predictor of depression and functional impairment, while war experiences and daily stressors were similarly predictive of general distress. For men, daily stressors moderated the relationship between war experiences and PTSD, which was significant only under conditions of low daily stress. The study's implications for research and intervention in conflict and post-conflict settings are considered.",

        "Abstract": "Bone marrow, peripheral blood and cord blood are all sources of hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic transplants. These sources differ in regard to collection methods, cellular content and transplant outcomes. In the related setting, use of peripheral blood stem cells, when compared to bone marrow, results in faster engraftment and may confer a survival benefit in advanced disease but also may lead to an increase in chronic graft-versus-host-disease. While cord blood stem cells are the simplest to collect and allow the greatest flexibility in HLA matching, they contain the lowest stem cell dose leading to the slowest engraftment. In this review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these different stem cell sources as well as areas for further research.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer survivorship is an emerging area of scientific and clinical interest. Several decades ago, most people diagnosed with cancer did not live long beyond their initial diagnosis. Today the number of cancer survivors exceeds ten million, and this group may experience unique healthcare issues related to their cancer treatment. Chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy each have their own late and long-term complications. It is imperative for clinicians who are caring for cancer survivors to be aware of long-term complications of therapy and to treat these appropriately. When cancer therapy has successfully added years of life, it is equally as important that medical care assures the best quality of life during those years.",

        "Title": "Seasons of survivorship revisited.",
        "Abstract": "Several decades ago the chance of a cancer survivor enjoying long-term survival was limited. At that time the terms cancer survivor and cancer survivorship were new. A cancer survivor was defined as a person from the moment of diagnosis onward for as long as they live. Cancer survivorship was also described in several \"seasons\" including; acute survivorship (the experience of diagnosis and treatment), extended survivorship (a time for \"watchful waiting\"), and then permanent survivorship (long-term remission). Today, acute cancer survivorship is still a time of intense emotion and medical activity surrounding the diagnosis, staging, and actual treatment. We then propose that after the intense initial therapy is completed the survivors enter a \"season\" that can be called \"transitional cancer survivorship\" reflecting the transition from active treatment to careful observation and the emotional, social, and medical adaptations that occur. Next, there are a growing number of cancer survivors who are (1) alive and \"living with cancer\" but requiring ongoing treatment for recurrent, active, and often advanced disease; (2) in a complete remission that requires ongoing therapy; or (3) in a complete remission and with a favorable prognosis. Collectively, this is a diverse group in \"extended survivorship\" and some later go on to obtain a permanent remission although others experience disease progression. Finally, there are millions of long-term or \"permanent survivors.\" This group is also very heterogeneous and is comprised of 4 subgroups including (1) survivors who are \"cancer-free but not free of cancer,\" (2) survivors who are cancer-free but continue to have significant \"fall-out\" from cancer and its treatment including psychosocial, medical, financial, or legal sequelae, (3) survivors who go on to develop second cancers which may be unrelated to the first cancer or its treatment, or may be more likely due to genetic or environmental factors, and also (4) survivors who later develop cancers that are secondary to the initial treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Dietary resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) has been implicated in the health benefits associated with grapes and red wine, more specifically with potential benefits for metabolic syndrome, energy use, and increased endurance. Levels of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, trans-piceid, were determined in 19 top selling commercially available cocoa-containing and chocolate products from the U.S. market. Amounts of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid were closely correlated with the amount of nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) in the cocoa-containing products. Among these products, trans-resveratrol levels were highest in cocoa powders (1.85 +/- 0.43 microg/g), followed by unsweetened baking chocolates (1.24 +/- 0.22), semisweet chocolate baking chips (0.52 +/- 0.14), dark chocolates (0.35 +/- 0.08), milk chocolates (0.10 +/- 0.05), and chocolate syrups (0.09 +/- 0.02). These cocoa-containing and chocolate products have about 3-5 times more trans-piceid than trans-resveratrol. Levels of trans-piceid were highest in the cocoa powders (7.14 +/- 0.80 microg/g), followed by unsweetened baking chocolates (4.04 +/- 0.14), semisweet chocolate baking chips (2.01 +/- 0.18), dark chocolates (1.82 +/- 0.36), milk chocolates (0.44 +/- 0.06), and chocolate syrups (0.35 +/- 0.06). On an equal weight basis, cocoa powder had about half as much trans-resveratrol as the average California red wine. On a per serving basis, cocoa-containing and chocolate products had less trans-resveratrol than red wine and grape juice but more than roasted peanuts. Overall, these cocoa-containing and chocolate products rank second after red wines and grape juice in foods with the highest levels of total trans-resveratrol in the diet.",

        "Title": "Impact of alkalization on the antioxidant and flavanol content of commercial cocoa powders.",
        "Abstract": "Cocoa is a food ingredient that is important for the contribution of flavor to foods but is also associated with potential health benefits. The chemistry thought to be responsible for its cardiovascular health benefits is the flavanol (flavan-3-ol) antioxidants. Evidence from the literature indicates that natural cocoas are high in flavanols, but when the cocoa is processed with alkali, also known as Dutch processing or Dutching, the flavanols are substantially reduced. This paper provides a survey of the physical and chemical composition of representative natural cocoas and lightly, medium, and heavily alkalized cocoas. As part of the survey, both brown/black and red/brown alkali-processed cocoas were measured. Natural cocoa powders have an extractable pH of 5.3-5.8. Alkalized cocoa powders were grouped into lightly treated (pH 6.50-7.20), medium-treated (pH 7.21-7.60), and heavily treated (pH 7.61 and higher). The natural, nonalkalized powders had the highest ORAC and total polyphenols and flavanols (including procyanidins). These chemical measurements showed a linear decrease as the extractable pH of the cocoa powder increased. Likewise, the flavanol monomers, oligomers, and polymers all showed a linear decrease with increasing pH of the final cocoa powder. When brown/black cocoa powders were compared to red cocoa powders, similar decreases in flavanols were observed with increased alkalization. The average total flavanol contents were 34.6 +/- 6.8 mg/g for the natural cocoas, 13.8 +/- 7.3 mg/g for the lightly processed cocoas, 7.8 +/- 4.0 mg/g for the medium processed cocoas, and 3.9 +/- 1.8 mg/g for the heavily processed cocoa powders. The observed linear and predictable impact of alkalization on flavanol content is discussed with respect to other reports in the literature as well as what implications it may have on diet and food manufacturing.",

        "Title": "A novel molecular solution for ultraviolet light detection in Caenorhabditis elegans.",
        "Abstract": "For many organisms the ability to transduce light into cellular signals is crucial for survival. Light stimulates DNA repair and metabolism changes in bacteria, avoidance responses in single-cell organisms, attraction responses in plants, and both visual and nonvisual perception in animals. Despite these widely differing responses, in all of nature there are only six known families of proteins that can transduce light. Although the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has none of the known light transduction systems, we show here that C. elegans strongly accelerates its locomotion in response to blue or shorter wavelengths of light, with maximal responsiveness to ultraviolet light. Our data suggest that C. elegans uses this light response to escape the lethal doses of sunlight that permeate its habitat. Short-wavelength light drives locomotion by bypassing two critical signals, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and diacylglycerol (DAG), that neurons use to shape and control behaviors. C. elegans mutants lacking these signals are paralyzed and unresponsive to harsh physical stimuli in ambient light, but short-wavelength light rapidly rescues their paralysis and restores normal levels of coordinated locomotion. This light response is mediated by LITE-1, a novel ultraviolet light receptor that acts in neurons and is a member of the invertebrate Gustatory receptor (Gr) family. Heterologous expression of the receptor in muscle cells is sufficient to confer light responsiveness on cells that are normally unresponsive to light. Our results reveal a novel molecular solution for ultraviolet light detection and an unusual sensory modality in C. elegans that is unlike any previously described light response in any organism.",

        "Abstract": "As life expectancy in the U.S. increases - and with it the proportion of the aged in the population - appropriate care of elderly skin becomes a medical concern of increasing importance. As skin ages, the intrinsic structural changes that are a natural consequence of passing time are inevitably followed by subsequent physiological changes that affect the skin's ability to function as the interface between internal and external environments. The pH of the skin surface increases with age, increasing its susceptibility to infection. Neurosensory perception of superficial pain is diminished both in intensity and speed of perception (increasing the risk of thermal injury); deep tissue pain, however, may be enhanced. A decline in lipid content as the skin ages inhibits the permeability of nonlipophilic compounds, reducing the efficacy of some topical medications. Allergic and irritant reactions are blunted, as is the inflammatory response, compromising the ability of the aged skin to affect wound repair. These functional impairments (although a predictable consequence of intrinsic structural changes) have the potential to cause significant morbidity in the elderly patient and may, as well, be greatly exacerbated by extrinsic factors like photodamage. As numbers of the elderly increase, medical as well as cosmetic dermatological interventions will be necessary to optimize the quality of life for this segment of the population.",

Patients often self-treat with over-the-counter antifungals or home remedies, although they are unable to distinguish among the possible causes of their symptoms. Telephone triage practices and time constraints on office visits may also hamper effective diagnosis. This review is a guide to distinguish potential causes of vulvovaginal symptoms. The first section describes both common and uncommon conditions associated with vulvovaginitis, including infectious vulvovaginitis, allergic contact dermatitis, systemic dermatoses, rare autoimmune diseases, and neuropathic vulvar pain syndromes. The focus is on the clinical presentation, specifically 1) the absence or presence and characteristics of vaginal discharge; 2) the nature of sensory symptoms (itch and/or pain, localized or generalized, provoked, intermittent, or chronic); and 3) the absence or presence of mucocutaneous changes, including the types of lesions observed and the affected tissue. Additionally, this review describes how such features of the clinical presentation can help identify various causes of vulvovaginitis.",

        "Abstract": "Where we allocate our visual spatial attention depends upon a continual competition between internally generated goals and external distractions. Recently it was shown that single neurons in the macaque lateral intraparietal area (LIP) can predict the amount of time a distractor can shift the locus of spatial attention away from a goal. We propose that this remarkable dynamical correspondence between single neurons and attention can be explained by a network model in which generically high-dimensional firing-rate vectors rapidly decay to a single mode. We find direct experimental evidence for this model, not only in the original attentional task, but also in a very different task involving perceptual decision making. These results confirm a theoretical prediction that slowly varying activity patterns are proportional to spontaneous activity, pose constraints on models of persistent activity, and suggest a network mechanism for the emergence of robust behavioral timing from heterogeneous neuronal populations.",

        "Abstract": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established several methods to delineate wellhead protection areas (WHPAs) around community wells in order to protect them from surface contamination sources. Delineating a WHPA often requires defining the capture zone for a well. Generally, analytical models or arbitrary setback zones have been used to define the capture zone in areas where little is known about the distribution of hydraulic head, hydraulic conductivity, or recharge. Numerical modeling, however, even in areas of sparse data, offers distinct advantages over the more simplified analytical models or arbitrary setback zones. The systematic approach discussed here calibrates a numerical flow model to regional topography and then applies a matrix of plausible recharge to hydraulic conductivity ratios (R/K) to investigate the impact on the size and shape of the capture zone. This approach does not attempt to determine the uncertainty of the model but instead yields several possible capture zones, the composite of which is likely to contain the actual capture zone. A WHPA based on this composite capture zone will protect ground water resources better than one based on any individual capture zone. An application of the method to three communities illustrates development of the R/K matrix and demonstrates that the method is particularly well suited for determining capture zones in alluvial aquifers.",

        "Title": "On the importance of static nonlinearity in estimating spatiotemporal neural filters with natural stimuli.",
        "Abstract": "Understanding neural responses with natural stimuli has increasingly become an essential part of characterizing neural coding. Neural responses are commonly characterized by a linear-nonlinear (LN) model, in which the output of a linear filter applied to the stimulus is transformed by a static nonlinearity to determine neural response. To estimate the linear filter in the LN model, studies of responses to natural stimuli commonly use methods that are unbiased only for a linear model (in which there is no static nonlinearity): spike-triggered averages with correction for stimulus power spectrum, with or without regularization. Although these methods work well for artificial stimuli, such as Gaussian white noise, we show here that they estimate neural filters of LN models from responses to natural stimuli much more poorly. We studied simple cells in cat primary visual cortex. We demonstrate that the filters computed by directly taking the nonlinearity into account have better predictive power and depend less on the stimulus than those computed under the linear model. With noise stimuli, filters computed using the linear and LN models were similar, as predicted theoretically. With natural stimuli, filters of the two models can differ profoundly. Noise and natural stimulus filters differed significantly in spatial properties, but these differences were exaggerated when filters were computed using the linear rather than the LN model. Although regularization of filters computed under the linear model improved their predictive power, it also led to systematic distortions of their spatial frequency profiles, especially at low spatial and temporal frequencies.",

        "Abstract": "We identify here a novel class of loss-of-function alleles of uncoordinated locomotion(unc)-108, which encodes the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of the mammalian small guanosine triphosphatase Rab2. Like the previously isolated dominant-negative mutants, unc-108 loss-of-function mutant animals are defective in locomotion. In addition, they display unique defects in the removal of apoptotic cells, revealing a previously uncharacterized function for Rab2. unc-108 acts in neurons and engulfing cells to control locomotion and cell corpse removal, respectively, indicating that unc-108 has distinct functions in different cell types. Using time-lapse microscopy, we find that unc-108 promotes the degradation of engulfed cell corpses. It is required for the efficient recruitment and fusion of lysosomes to phagosomes and the acidification of the phagosomal lumen. In engulfing cells, UNC-108 is enriched on the surface of phagosomes. We propose that UNC-108 acts on phagosomal surfaces to promote phagosome maturation and suggest that mammalian Rab2 may have a similar function in the degradation of apoptotic cells.",

        "Abstract": "As life expectancy in industrialized countries increases, appropriate care of elderly skin looms as a dermatologic priority. Skin aging is a complex, multifactorial process whose baseline rate is genetically determined but that may be accelerated by environmental, mechanical, or socioeconomic factors. The intrinsic structural changes that occur with the aging of the skin increase skin fragility, decrease the ability of the skin to heal, increase risk for toxicological injuries, promote the development of various cutaneous disorders, and produce aesthetically undesirable effects like wrinkling and uneven pigmentation. As aged patients represent a larger segment of the population, increased attention to the problems of the aged skin, both cosmetic and beyond, will be necessary and should build on currently successful interventions to improve their quality of life.",

        "Abstract": "As the adults age, the risk of both urinary and fecal incontinence increases, the result of natural degenerative changes in concert with concomitant issues of aging such as infection, polypharmacy, and decreased cognitive function. Most adults past the age of 65 suffer incontinence on some level, with significant and often devastating impact on the physical and emotional health of the patient. Incontinence in the older adult is a humiliating and disabling disorder, which causes substantial stress, depression, and limitation. It can impede interpersonal relationships, decrease sexual function, and increase the risk of debilitating falls, institutionalization, and even increase mortality. Incontinence also represents a substantial economic burden to the general population. Nonetheless, incontinence is often undiagnosed, and when diagnosed, often left untreated. Although common in older adults, incontinence is not an inevitable consequence of aging but a disorder that can and should be treated. Appropriate clinical management of incontinence can help seniors continue to lead vital, active lives as well as avoid the cutaneous sequelae of this disorder.",

        "Abstract": "A novel regio- and stereoselective [Rh(CO)2Cl]2-catalyzed allylic alkylation of unsymmetrical allylic carbonates was discovered. The regioselectivity of the reaction favors product ratios in which substitution occurs at the carbon bearing the leaving group. When an enantiomerically enriched carbonate (> or = 99% ee) was examined, the Rh(I)-catalyzed allylic alkylation proceeded stereoselectively to provide the alkylation product with retention of absolute stereochemistry (98% ee). To establish the scope of the [Rh(CO)2Cl]2-catalyzed allylic alkylation, a variety of carbon and heteroatom nucleophiles were examined and the results described. As an application of the Rh(I)-catalyzed allylic alkylation, a series of novel domino reactions have been developed that couple the unique regio- and stereoselective [Rh(CO)2Cl]2-catalyzed alkylation of allylic trifluoroacetates with an intramolecular Pauson-Khand annulation, a cycloisomerization, or a [5+2] cycloaddition. A unique aspect of the method described is the use of a single catalyst to effect sequential transformations in which the catalytic activity is moderated simply by controlling the reaction temperature. Implementation of such processes provides a rapid and efficient entry to a variety of bicyclic carbon skeletons from simple precursors.",

        "Abstract": "The Galpha(q) pathway is essential for animal life and is a central pathway for driving locomotion, egg laying, and growth in Caenorhabditis elegans, where it exerts its effects through EGL-8 (phospholipase Cbeta [PLCbeta]) and at least one other effector. To find the missing effector, we performed forward genetic screens to suppress the slow growth and hyperactive behaviors of mutants with an overactive Galpha(q) pathway. Four suppressor mutations disrupted the Rho-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain of UNC-73 (Trio). The mutations produce defects in neuronal function, but not neuronal development, that cause sluggish locomotion similar to animals lacking EGL-8 (PLCbeta). Strains containing null mutations in both EGL-8 (PLCbeta) and UNC-73 (Trio RhoGEF) have strong synthetic phenotypes that phenocopy the arrested growth and near-complete paralysis of Galpha(q)-null mutants. Using cell-based and biochemical assays, we show that activated C. elegans Galpha(q) synergizes with Trio RhoGEF to activate RhoA. Activated Galpha(q) and Trio RhoGEF appear to be part of a signaling complex, because they coimmunoprecipitate when expressed together in cells. Our results show that Trio's Rho-specific GEF domain is a major Galpha(q) effector that, together with PLCbeta, mediates the Galpha(q) signaling that drives the locomotion, egg laying, and growth of the animal.",

The increase in the incidence of incontinence is not only dependent on age but also on the onset of concomitant ageing issues such as infection, polypharmacy, and decreased cognitive function. If incontinence is left untreated, a host of dermatological complications can occur, including incontinence dermatitis, dermatological infections, intertrigo, vulvar folliculitis, and pruritus ani. The presence of chronic incontinence can produce a vicious cycle of skin damage and inflammation because of the loss of cutaneous integrity. Minimizing skin damage caused by incontinence is dependent on successful control of excess hydration, maintenance of proper pH, minimization of interaction between urine and faeces, and prevention of secondary infection. Even though incontinence is common in the aged, it is not an inevitable consequence of ageing but a disorder that can and should be treated.

        "Title": "Effects of inhibitory gain and conductance fluctuations in a simple model for contrast-invariant orientation tuning in cat V1.",
        "Abstract": "The origin of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1) is a model problem for understanding cerebral cortical circuitry. A key constraint is that orientation tuning width is invariant under changes in stimulus contrast. We have previously shown that this can arise from the combination of feedforward lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input and an orientation-untuned component of feedforward inhibition that dominates excitation. However, these models did not include the large background voltage noise observed in vivo. Here, we include this noise and examine a simple model of cat V1 response. Constraining our simulations to fit physiological data, our single model parameter is the strength of feedforward inhibition relative to LGN excitation. With physiological noise, the contrast invariance of orientation tuning depends little on inhibition level, although very weak or very strong inhibition leads to weak broadening or sharpening, respectively, of tuning with contrast. For any inhibition level, an alternative measure of orientation tuning -- the circular variance -- decreases with contrast as observed experimentally. These results arise primarily because the voltage noise causes large inputs to be much more strongly amplified than small ones in evoking spiking responses, relatively suppressing responses to nonpreferred stimuli. However, inhibition comparable to or stronger than excitation appears necessary to suppress spiking responses to nonpreferred orientations to the extent seen in vivo and to allow the emergence of a tuned mean voltage response. These two response properties provide the strongest constraints on model details. Antiphase inhibition from inhibitory simple cells, and not just untuned inhibition from inhibitory complex cells, appears necessary to fully explain these aspects of cortical orientation tuning.",

A mixed-method design was used in Kabul, Afghanistan, to identify local indicators of distress and develop the 22-item Afghan Symptom Checklist (ASCL). The ASCL contains several indigenous items and items familiar to Western mental health professionals. The ASCL was pilot tested and subsequently administered to 324 adults in 8 districts of Kabul. It demonstrated excellent reliability (alpha=.93) and good construct validity, correlating strongly with a measure of exposure to war-related violence and loss (r=.70). Results of the survey indicate moderate levels of distress among Afghan men and markedly higher levels of distress and impaired functioning among women (and widows in particular).",

The authors question the utility of the dominant focus on posttraumatic stress disorder and other disorders of Western psychiatry, and they identify a set of critical research foci related to mental health work with communities affected by political violence. Core assumptions of TFPE and its roots in logical positivism and the biomedical model of contemporary psychiatry are explored. The authors suggest that an alternative framework--social constructivism--can serve as a bridge between researchers and practitioners by helping to refocus research efforts in ways that are conceptually and methodologically more attuned to the needs of war-affected communities and those working to address their mental health needs.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine how upper thoracic spinal neurons responded to activation and desensitization of cardiac transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1)-containing afferent fibers. Extracellular potentials of single T3 spinal neurons were recorded in pentobarbital-anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated male rats. To activate cardiac nociceptive receptors, a catheter was placed in the pericardial sac to administer various chemicals: bradykinin (BK; 10 microg/ml, 0.2 ml), capsaicin (CAP, 10 microg/ml, 0.2 ml), or a mixture of algesic chemicals (AC; 0.2 ml) containing adenosine 10(-3) M, BK, serotonin, histamine, and PGE(2), 10(-5) M for each. Spinal neurons that responded to intrapericardial BK and/or CAP were used in this study. Results showed that 81% (35/43) of the neurons had excitatory responses to both intrapericardial BK and CAP, and the remainder responded to either BK or CAP. Intrapericardial resiniferatoxin (RTX) (0.2 microg/ml, 0.2 ml, 1 min), which desensitizes TRPV1-containing nerve endings, abolished excitatory responses to both BK (n = 8) and CAP (n = 7), and to AC (n = 5) but not to somatic stimuli. Intrapericardial capsazepine (1 mg/ml, 0.2 ml, 3 min), a specific antagonist of TRPV1, sharply attenuated excitatory responses to CAP in 5/5 neurons, but responses to BK in 5/5 neurons was maintained. Additionally, intrapericardial capsazepine had no significant effect on excitatory responses to AC in 3/3 neurons. These data indicated that intrapericardial BK-initiated spinal neuronal responses were linked to cardiac TRPV1-containing afferent fibers, but were not dependent on TRPV1. Intraspinal signaling for cardiac nociception was mediated through CAP-sensitive afferent fibers innervating the heart.",

        "Abstract": "Between 2002 and 2012, the number of individuals > 55 years of age in the workforce is projected to climb by approximately 50%. Few studies have substantiated that severe occupational injury to older workers is a significant problem. To identify the variables related to traumatic injuries of older workers, data were abstracted retrospectively from a regional trauma center database, including demographic and injury characteristics, length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and cost. The results showed that older workers had higher fatality rates than younger workers. As age increased, the Injury Severity Score also increased. Most injuries were the result of falls, with orthopedic injuries being the most common type of injury. Patients spent an average of 6 days in the ICU at a cost of > 4920 US dollars/day. By identifying the characteristics associated with older workers' severe occupational injuries, further research and better industry programs targeting this group can be implemented.",

        "Abstract": "In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing products in the United States.",

        "Abstract": "Forward genetic screens for mutations that rescue the paralysis of ric-8 (Synembryn) reduction-of-function mutations frequently reveal mutations that cause hyperactivation of one or more components of the G alpha(s) pathway. Here, we report that one of these mutations strongly reduces the function of the Dunce cAMP phosphodiesterase PDE-4 by disrupting a conserved active site residue. Loss of function and neural overexpression of PDE-4 have profound and opposite effects on locomotion rate, but drug-response assays suggest that loss of PDE-4 function does not affect steady-state acetylcholine release or reception. Our genetic analysis suggests that PDE-4 regulates both G alpha(s)-dependent and G alpha(s)-independent cAMP pools in the neurons controlling locomotion rate. By immunostaining, PDE-4 is strongly expressed throughout the nervous system, where it localizes to small regions at the outside boundaries of synaptic vesicle clusters as well as intersynaptic regions. The synaptic subregions containing PDE-4 are distinct from those containing active zones, as indicated by costaining with an antibody against the long form of UNC-13. This highly focal subsynaptic localization suggests that PDE-4 may exert its effects by spatially regulating intrasynaptic cAMP pools.",

        "Abstract": "Sensory neuroscience seeks to understand how the brain encodes natural environments. However, neural coding has largely been studied using simplified stimuli. In order to assess whether the brain's coding strategy depends on the stimulus ensemble, we apply a new information-theoretic method that allows unbiased calculation of neural filters (receptive fields) from responses to natural scenes or other complex signals with strong multipoint correlations. In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments. Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously reported forms of adaptation.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a patient with acquired alpha-thalassemia myelodysplastic syndrome (ATMDS). A previously healthy 66-year-old man presented with hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 59 fL, and a bone marrow aspirate with increased erythroid precursors and hypolobulated megakaryocytes. Hemoglobin H inclusions were seen in most red cells after 1% brilliant cresyl blue supravital stain of the peripheral blood. At the molecular level, we identified of a novel mutation in the most 3' exon of the ATRX gene (CGA-->TGA substitution in codon 2407) resulting in a premature termination codon (p.R2407X). This case provides further evidence for a link between ATRX mutations and ATMDS, and suggests a possible role for the conserved Q-box element in ATRX function.",

        "Abstract": "We review Phanerozoic sea-level changes [543 million years ago (Ma) to the present] on various time scales and present a new sea-level record for the past 100 million years (My). Long-term sea level peaked at 100 +/- 50 meters during the Cretaceous, implying that ocean-crust production rates were much lower than previously inferred. Sea level mirrors oxygen isotope variations, reflecting ice-volume change on the 10(4)- to 10(6)-year scale, but a link between oxygen isotope and sea level on the 10(7)-year scale must be due to temperature changes that we attribute to tectonically controlled carbon dioxide variations. Sea-level change has influenced phytoplankton evolution, ocean chemistry, and the loci of carbonate, organic carbon, and siliciclastic sediment burial. Over the past 100 My, sea-level changes reflect global climate evolution from a time of ephemeral Antarctic ice sheets (100 to 33 Ma), through a time of large ice sheets primarily in Antarctica (33 to 2.5 Ma), to a world with large Antarctic and large, variable Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (2.5 Ma to the present).",

        "Abstract": "C. elegans mutants lacking the dense-core vesicle priming protein UNC-31 (CAPS) share highly similar phenotypes with mutants lacking a neuronal G alpha(s) pathway, including strong paralysis despite exhibiting near normal levels of steady-state acetylcholine release as indicated by drug sensitivity assays. Our genetic analysis shows that UNC-31 and neuronal G alpha(s) are different parts of the same pathway and that the UNC-31/G alpha(s) pathway is functionally distinct from the presynaptic G alpha(q) pathway with which it interacts. UNC-31 acts upstream of G alpha(s) because mutations that activate the G alpha(s) pathway confer similar levels of strongly hyperactive, coordinated locomotion in both unc-31 null and (+) backgrounds. Using cell-specific promoters, we show that both UNC-31 and the G alpha(s) pathway function in cholinergic motor neurons to regulate locomotion rate. Using immunostaining we show that UNC-31 is often concentrated at or near active zones of cholinergic motor neuron synapses. Our data suggest that presynaptic UNC-31 activity, likely acting via dense-core vesicle exocytosis, is required to locally activate the neuronal G alpha(s) pathway near synaptic active zones.",

        "Abstract": "Complications of diabetes mellitus within the nervous system are peripheral and central neuropathy. In peripheral neuropathy, defects in neurofilament and microtubules have been demonstrated. In this study, we examined the effects of insulin deficiency within the brain in insulin knockout mice (I-/-). The I-/- exhibited hyperphosphorylation of tau, at threonine 231, and neurofilament. In addition, we showed hyperphosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta) at serine 9. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK 1) showed decrease in phosphorylation, whereas ERK 2 showed no changes. Ultrastructural examination demonstrated swollen mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus, and dispersion of the nuclear chromatin. Microtubules showed decrease in the number of intermicrotubule bridges and neurofilament presented as bunches. Thus, lack of insulin brain stimulation induces JNK hyperphosphorylation followed by hyperphosphorylation of tau and neurofilament, and ultrastructural cellular damage, that over time may induce decrease in cognition and learning disabilities.",

In this study, we utilized these synergistic effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, sargramostim [Leukine]), hydroxyurea, and low-dose cytosine arabinoside to treat elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In a single-institution, retrospective study, we evaluated 94 treatments with concomitant hydroxyurea, cytosine arabinoside, and GM-CSF between the years of 1997 and 2003 in high-risk elderly patients with AML or MDS. A total of 80% of patients received all of the GM-CSF doses; 78% of patients received all of the cytosine arabinoside doses. Adverse events were minimal. No patient developed mucositis or alopecia. The most common adverse event was neutropenic fever, which was noted in 57% of patients. Twenty-one percent of patients remained neutropenic after treatment until death or relapse. Sixty-eight percent of patients reached an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 1000 microL in a median of 33.5 days. Our data show an overall response rate of 52%, with a complete response rate of 39% and a partial response rate of 13%. Overall, our study showed that low-dose cytosine arabinoside given by continuous infusion together with continuous infusion GM-CSF and hydroxyurea was well-tolerated and effective in treating elderly AML and MDS patients who were not eligible for standard induction therapy.",

        "Abstract": "A review of the operational health physics papers published in Health Physics and Operational Radiation Safety over the past fifteen years indicated seventeen general categories or areas into which the topics could be readily separated. These areas include academic research programs, use of computers in operational health physics, decontamination and decommissioning, dosimetry, emergency response, environmental health physics, industrial operations, medical health physics, new procedure development, non-ionizing radiation, radiation measurements, radioactive waste disposal, radon measurement and control, risk communication, shielding evaluation and specification, staffing levels for health physics programs, and unwanted or orphan sources. That is not to say that there are no operational papers dealing with specific areas of health physics, such as power reactor health physics, accelerator health physics, or governmental health physics. On the contrary, there have been a number of excellent operational papers from individuals in these specialty areas and they are included in the broader topics listed above. A listing and review of all the operational papers that have been published is beyond the scope of this discussion. However, a sampling of the excellent operational papers that have appeared in Health Physics and Operational Radiation Safety is presented to give the reader the flavor of the wide variety of concerns to the operational health physicist and the current areas of interest where procedures are being refined and solutions to problems are being developed.",

        "Title": "Determination of active ingredient within pharmaceutical preparations using flow injection mass spectrometry.",
        "Abstract": "Two separate pharmaceutical blends, one containing 2% caffeine by weight, the other containing 2% creatine by weight, and 200 mg caffeine tablets were examined in this study. The purpose of the analyses was to determine the feasibility of using flow injection mass spectrometry for the quantitative analysis of active ingredient within a drug product or other form of pharmaceutical preparation. For more precise and accurate measurements, it was necessary to incorporate an internal reference within the samples. Further, flow injection analysis showed to provide quicker, more facile method development than the application of chromatographic separation. Samples were analyzed over an analyte concentration range of 5.0-15.0 microg/mL. Analyte selectivity was obtained through the observance of the (M+H)(+) ions generated by positive electrospray ionization of each of the analytes (m/z 195 for caffeine and m/z 132 for creatine), and accurate quantitation was achieved by determining the ratio of the analyte response versus the response of the incorporated reference compound. Sample-to-sample precision in these measurements was less than 3%, recovery values were shown to be accurate to within +/-3% of the actual values, and both analytical methods proved to be linear over the assay range (R(2)> or =0.999). Due to the excellent selectivity and low detection limits available to mass spectrometric detection, flow injection mass spectrometric analysis could be particularly applicable for analysis of formulations that contain either low doses of active ingredient, active ingredient with low solubility, or active ingredient that does not possess a strong chromophore. Additionally, this type of methodology shows to be conducive for rapid method development.",

        "Abstract": "The authors used semistructured interviews to examine exile-related stressors affecting a sample of 28 adult Bosnian refugees in Chicago. The interviews covered 3 areas: life in prewar Bosnia, the journey of exile, and, most centrally, life in Chicago. Primary sources of exile-related distress included social isolation and the loss of community, separation from family members, the loss of important life projects, a lack of environmental mastery, poverty and related stressors such as inadequate housing, and the loss of valued social roles. The implications of these findings for mental health interventions with refugees are considered, and the value of narrative methods in research with refugee communities is discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Findings are presented from a narrative study that examined the use of interpreters in psychotherapy with refugees. Fifteen therapists and 15 interpreters were interviewed at 14 refugee mental health treatment centers in the United States. Core findings concerned the impact of interpreters on the therapeutic alliance, the complex emotional reactions that may arise within the therapy triad, the effects of interpreting on interpreters' own well-being, the multiple roles that interpreters play in addition to translating language, and the training and supervision needs of interpreters and of therapists who work with them. Implications of these findings for agencies that use interpreters in their clinical work with refugees are considered, and specific recommendations are made concerning the hiring, training, and support of interpreting staff.",

        "Abstract": "A review of the operational health physics papers published in Health Physics and Operational Radiation Safety over the past fifteen years indicated seventeen general categories or areas into which the topics could be readily separated. These areas include academic research programs, use of computers in operational health physics, decontamination and decommissioning, dosimetry, emergency response, environmental health physics, industrial operations, medical health physics, new procedure development, non-ionizing radiation, radiation measurements, radioactive waste disposal, radon measurement and control, risk communication, shielding evaluation and specification, staffing levels for health physics programs, and unwanted or orphan sources. That is not to say that there are no operational papers dealing with specific areas of health physics, such as power reactor health physics, accelerator health physics, or governmental health physics. On the contrary, there have been a number of excellent operational papers from individuals in these specialty areas and they are included in the broader topics listed above. A listing and review of all the operational papers that have been published is beyond the scope of this discussion. However, a sampling of the excellent operational papers that have appeared in Health Physics and Operational Radiation Safety is presented to give the reader the flavor of the wide variety of concerns to the operational health physicist and the current areas of interest where procedures are being refined and solutions to problems are being developed.",

        "Abstract": "We used gain-of-function and null synaptic signaling network mutants to investigate the relationship of the G alpha(q) and G alpha(s) pathways to synaptic vesicle priming and to each other. Genetic epistasis studies using G alpha(q) gain-of-function and null mutations, along with a mutation that blocks synaptic vesicle priming and the synaptic vesicle priming stimulator phorbol ester, suggest that the G alpha(q) pathway generates the core, obligatory signals for synaptic vesicle priming. In contrast, the G alpha(s) pathway is not required for the core priming function, because steady-state levels of neurotransmitter release are not significantly altered in animals lacking a neuronal G alpha(s) pathway, even though these animals are strongly paralyzed as a result of functional (nondevelopmental) defects. However, our genetic analysis indicates that these two functionally distinct pathways converge and that they do so downstream of DAG production. Further linking the two pathways, our epistasis analysis of a ric-8 null mutant suggests that RIC-8 (a receptor-independent G alpha guanine nucleotide exchange factor) is required to maintain both the G alpha(q) vesicle priming pathway and the neuronal G alpha(s) pathway in a functional state. We propose that the neuronal G alpha(s) pathway transduces critical positional information onto the core G alpha(q) pathway to stabilize the priming of selected synapses that are optimal for locomotion.",

        "Abstract": "To identify hypothesized missing components of the synaptic G alpha(o)-G alpha(q) signaling network, which tightly regulates neurotransmitter release, we undertook two large forward genetic screens in the model organism C. elegans and focused first on mutations that strongly rescue the paralysis of ric-8(md303) reduction-of-function mutants, previously shown to be defective in G alpha(q) pathway activation. Through high-resolution mapping followed by sequence analysis, we show that these mutations affect four genes. Two activate the G alpha(q) pathway through gain-of-function mutations in G alpha(q); however, all of the remaining mutations activate components of the G alpha(s) pathway, including G alpha(s), adenylyl cyclase, and protein kinase A. Pharmacological assays suggest that the G alpha(s) pathway-activating mutations increase steady-state neurotransmitter release, and the strongly impaired neurotransmitter release of ric-8(md303) mutants is rescued to greater than wild-type levels by the strongest G alpha(s) pathway activating mutations. Using transgene induction studies, we show that activating the G alpha(s) pathway in adult animals rapidly induces hyperactive locomotion and rapidly rescues the paralysis of the ric-8 mutant. Using cell-specific promoters we show that neuronal, but not muscle, G alpha(s) pathway activation is sufficient to rescue ric-8(md303)'s paralysis. Our results appear to link RIC-8 (synembryn) and a third major G alpha pathway, the G alpha(s) pathway, with the previously discovered G alpha(o) and G alpha(q) pathways of the synaptic signaling network.",

        "Abstract": "This paper examines the role of trust and the concept of access as they affect the relational context in which community research, and research with refugee communities in particular, is conducted. Sociologist Irving Goffman's metaphor of frontstage and backstage behavior is used to illustrate the complexity and importance of developing of relations of trust, and thereby gaining \"backstage\" access, in communities that are generally closed to outsiders. It is argued that gaining authentic (\"backstage\") access to refugee communities, as well as other communities that have developed a self-protective insularity, is essential if we are to gather data that accurately reflect the actual beliefs, feelings, and experiences of community members. The paper then examines the puzzling lack of discussion regarding issues of trust, access, and the relational context in the literature on refugee mental health. Explanations for this apparent inattention are sought in the influence of the prevailing scientific paradigm that guides most research with refugees, and that shapes the values of the field's \"gatekeepers,\" the editors and reviewers of scholarly journals. Throughout the paper, key points are illustrated with examples drawn from the author's research with refugees from Guatemala, Bosnia, and Afghanistan.",

The treatment paradigm focuses almost exclusively on preventing further loss or injury through employee education. There is a dearth of studies related to NIHL and hernias.

The key is that prevention is cheaper than treatment for these injuries.",

        "Abstract": "Auditory neurobiology has benefited significantly from ethological approaches using acoustic communication signals. Developing an ethological model in a genetically manipulable system such as the mouse would enhance the ability to investigate the processing, learning, and recognition of sounds. Characterizing the basic acoustic structure of mouse vocalizations would help lay a foundation for such a future study. Towards this goal, ultrasound vocalizations emitted by isolated mouse pups and pairs of adult males and females have been digitally recorded and examined. Previous work suggests that these calls may have communicative significance. An analysis of the natural variability in their spectral content, median frequency, duration, and repetition period reveals acoustic structure that could be used for recognizing the calls. Other parameters, like the rate of frequency modulation, may also be informative, but have not been examined. Pup isolation calls develop systematically between postnatal day 5 and 12 towards a more stereotyped vocalization--contracting from a wide range of values into narrower clusters of frequency and duration, and shifting from longer to shorter repetition periods. Most significantly, pup isolation and adult encounter calls fall into two distinct spectral and temporal categories, making it possible for a receiver to acoustically distinguish between them, and to potentially categorically perceive them along those dimensions.",

        "Abstract": "Reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantations for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients have been limited by significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), treatment-related mortality, and disease relapse. We treated 18 MDS patients ineligible for standard allogeneic transplantation with a preparative regimen of photopheresis day -7 and -6, pentostatin 4 mg/m(2) by continuous infusion day -5 and -4, and total body irradiation 600 cGy in 3 fractions day -3 and -2, followed by allogeneic stem cell infusion from 6/6 or 5/6 HLA-matched related donors or 6/6 HLA-matched unrelated donors. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin A and a short course of methotrexate. The median age was 54 years (range, 30-70 years). Diagnoses included refractory anemia (n = 2), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (n = 2), refractory anemia with excess blasts (n = 10), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (n = 3), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 1). Sixteen of 18 patients developed full donor chimerism with no day +100 transplant-related mortality. Grade II to IV acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD developed in 19% and 18% of patients, respectively. Disease relapse occurred in 2 patients. At a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 1-35 months), the 1-year failure-free and overall survival were 64% and 65%, respectively. Our photopheresis and pentostatin-based reduced-intensity preparative regimen for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in high-risk MDS patients achieves successful donor engraftment and disease remission with less transplant toxicity and grade II to IV acute GVHD.",

        "Abstract": "Previously, we proposed a model of the circuitry underlying simple-cell responses in cat primary visual cortex (V1) layer 4. We argued that the ordered arrangement of lateral geniculate nucleus inputs to a simple cell must be supplemented by a component of feedforward inhibition that is untuned for orientation and responds to high temporal frequencies to explain the sharp contrast-invariant orientation tuning and low-pass temporal frequency tuning of simple cells. The temporal tuning also requires a significant NMDA component in geniculocortical synapses. Recent experiments have revealed cat V1 layer 4 inhibitory neurons with two distinct types of receptive fields (RFs): complex RFs with mixed ON/OFF responses lacking in orientation tuning, and simple RFs with normal, sharp-orientation tuning (although, some respond to all orientations). We show that complex inhibitory neurons can provide the inhibition needed to explain simple-cell response properties. Given this complex cell inhibition, antiphase or \"push-pull\" inhibition from tuned simple inhibitory neurons acts to sharpen spatial frequency tuning, lower responses to low temporal frequency stimuli, and increase the stability of cortical activity.",

        "Abstract": "We model the effects of excitation and inhibition on the gain of cortical neurons. Previous theoretical work has concluded that excitation or inhibition alone will not cause a multiplicative gain change in the curve of firing rate versus input current. However, such gain changes in vivo are measured in the curve of firing rate versus stimulus parameter. We find that when this curve is considered, and when the nonlinear relationships between stimulus parameter and input current and between input current and firing rate in vivo are taken into account, then simple excitation or inhibition alone can induce a multiplicative gain change. In particular, the power-law relationship between voltage and firing rate that is induced by neuronal noise is critical to this result. This suggests an unexpectedly simple mechanism that may underlie the gain modulations commonly observed in cortex. More generally, it suggests that a smaller input will multiplicatively modulate the gain of a larger one when both converge on a common cortical target.",

        "Abstract": "beta-Arrestin-1 (betaArr1) plays a major role in the desensitization and internalization of G protein-coupled receptors. We previously localized betaArr1 in the sensory neurons of rat lumbar 4 and 5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and reported the predominant presence of betaArr1 in the small-diameter DRG neurons that are often implicated with nociception. Because of betaArr1's crucial role in regulating the initiation of cellular signaling, in the current study we evaluated the distribution of betaArr1 in the peripheral sensory terminals where various receptors are present. Western blotting confirmed the presence of betaArr1 immunoreactivity in the rat skin. Sciatic nerve ligation demonstrated that betaArr1 is transported peripherally from the DRG, and immunohistochemistry showed betaArr1 immunoreactivity in the glabrous skin of the rat hindpaw. In the glabrous skin, strong betaArr1 immunoreactivity was detected in nerve fibers in the dermal nerve plexus and dermal papillae. Fine varicose immunoreactive fibers were found in the epidermis. In addition, betaArr1 was observed in specialized sensory receptors such as Meissner corpuscles. Our observations thus indicate that betaArr1 may be involved in modulation of specific tactile stimulation from the skin in addition to nociception.",

        "Abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) causes significant morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation following either a conventional or reduced-intensity preparative regimen. In a murine model, inactivation of host dendritic cells (DCs) was associated with a significant reduction in acute GVHD, suggesting that host DCs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD. The role of host DCs in the development of GVHD following allogeneic stem cell transplantation in humans, however, is unclear. We examined DC chimerism in patients with various hematologic malignancies who underwent a reduced-intensity preparative regimen of extracorporeal photophoresis, pentostatin, and reduced-dose total body irradiation (n = 21) or a conventional preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (n = 3). Full donor hematopoietic reconstitution was demonstrated in 19 of 21 patients who underwent a reduced-intensity preparative regimen and in all patients who underwent a conventional preparative regimen. Grade 0 to I acute GVHD and limited or no chronic GVHD were observed in 18 patients who underwent a reduced-intensity regimen and 1 patient who underwent a conventional regimen who achieved full donor DC chimerism at day +100 posttransplantation. In contrast, grade II to IV acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD were observed in the 2 patients who underwent a conventional regimen and the 1 patient who underwent a reduced-intensity regimen who had host rather than donor DC chimerism. The persistence of host DCs at day +100 posttransplantation is correlated with the development of severe acute and chronic GVHD (P =.001). Host DCs may represent a therapeutic target for reducing GVHD in allogeneic bone marrow transplants.",

        "Abstract": "Some evidence shows that the upper cervical spinal cord might play an important role in propriospinal processing as a sensory filter and modulator for visceral afferents. The aims of this study were to determine (1). the responses of C(1)-C(2) spinal neurons to gastric distension and (2). the relative contribution of vagal and spinal visceral afferent pathways for transmission of gastric input to the upper cervical spinal cord. Extracellular potentials of single C(1)-C(2) spinal neurons were recorded in pentobarbital anesthetized male rats. Graded gastric distension (20-80 mm Hg) was produced by air inflation of a latex balloon surgically placed in the stomach. Sixteen percent of the neurons (32/198) responded to gastric distension; 17 neurons were excited and 15 neurons were inhibited by gastric distension. Spontaneous activity of neurons with inhibitory responses was higher than those neurons with excitatory responses (18.1+/-2.7 vs. 3.8+/-1.7 impulses s(-1), p<0.001). Twenty-eight of thirty-two (87.5%) neurons responded to mechanical stimulation of somatic fields on head, neck, ears or shoulder. Most lesion sites of neurons with excitatory responses were found in laminae V, VII; however, neurons with inhibitory responses were in laminae III, IV. Bilateral cervical vagotomy abolished responses of 4/8 neurons tested. Spinal transection at C(6)-C(7) abolished responses of the other four neurons that still responded to gastric distension after bilateral vagotomy. Results of these data supported the concept that a group of C(1)-C(2) spinal neurons might play a role in processing sensory information from the stomach that travels in vagal and spinal visceral afferent fibers.",

        "Abstract": "The purposes of this study were to examine responses of superficial (depth <300 microm) and deeper thoracic spinal neurons to chemical stimulation of cardiac afferents and effects of descending influences on these neurons. Extracellular potentials of single T(3)-T(4) neurons were recorded in pentobarbital anesthetized, paralyzed and ventilated male rats. A catheter was placed in the pericardial sac to administer 0.2 ml of a mixture of algogenic chemicals that contained adenosine (10(-3) M), bradykinin, histamine, serotonin, prostaglandin E(2) (10(-5) M). Fifteen of 55 (27%) superficial neurons responsive to intrapericardial chemicals were compared to 80/169 (47%) deeper neurons. All 15 superficial neurons that responded to cardiac afferents were excited (E), whereas 66 deeper neurons were excited, ten were inhibited and four showed excitation-inhibition. Spontaneous activity of superficial neurons with short-lasting excitatory responses was significantly lower than that of deeper neurons (P<0.05). Somatic receptive fields on chest, axilla, arm and upper back areas were found for 77/95 (81%) neurons that responded to intrapericardial chemicals. The proportion of somatic field properties and their sizes in superficial neurons were similar to deeper neurons. After cervical spinal transection, both spontaneous activity and responses to chemical stimulation of cardiac afferents significantly increased in six out of six neurons excited by intrapericardial injections. Results showed that chemical stimulation of cardiac afferents excited superficial T(3)-T(4) spinal neurons, whereas deeper neurons exhibited multiple patterns of responses. Some characteristics of subgroups of superficial neurons were quantitatively different from deeper neurons. Thoracic spinal neurons processing cardiac nociceptive information were under tonic descending inhibition.",

        "Title": "Understanding layer 4 of the cortical circuit: a model based on cat V1.",
        "Abstract": "This paper reviews theoretical and experimental results on the processing of layer 4, the input-recipient layer, of cat primary visual cortex (V1). A wide range of experimental data can be understood from a model in which response tuning of layer 4 cells is largely determined by a local interplay of feedforward excitation (from thalamus) and feedforward inhibition (from layer 4 inhibitory interneurons driven by thalamus). Feedforward inhibition dominates excitation, inherits its tuning from the thalamic input and sharpens the tuning of excitatory cells. At least a strong component of the feedforward inhibition received by a cell is spatially opponent to the excitation it receives, meaning that inhibition is driven by dark in regions of the visual field in which excitation is driven by light, and vice versa. The idea of opponent inhibition can be generalized to mean inhibition driven by input patterns that are strongly anti-correlated with the patterns that excite a cell. This paper argues that dominant feedforward opponent inhibition may be a general principle of cortical layer 4. This leads to the suggestion that the properties that show columnar organization--invariance across the vertical depth of cortex--may be properties that are shared by 'opposite' (anticorrelated) stimulus pairs. This contrasts with the more common idea that a column represents a set of cells that all share similar stimulus preferences.",

        "Abstract": "Thrombocytopenia is a poor prognostic indicator in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Treatment options for patients with symptomatic thrombocytopenia are limited. Danazol, an attenuated androgen, may have some efficacy in increasing the platelet count of patients with MDS. We retrospectively reviewed 33 patients with primary MDS who were treated with danazol for 6 or more weeks. After 6 weeks on danazol, the mean platelet count increased from 42 x 10(9)/L to 60 x 10(9)/L (P < 0.015), and 25 out of 33 patients (76%) had an increase in their platelet counts. Following 12 weeks of treatment, the mean platelet count increased to 67 x 10(9)/L (P < 0.005), and 21 out of 29 patients (72%) had an increase in their platelet counts. Seven out of nine patients no longer required platelet transfusions because bleeding stopped after 6 weeks on danazol. Mean duration of response was 10 months (range 2-68 months). Responses were seen in all French-American-British (FAB) subtypes and in all International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) scores. Therapy was well tolerated. Danazol may be effective in MDS patients who are thrombocytopenic.",

As hypothesized, exposure to war-related violence was highly predictive of PTSD symptoms in both groups; in addition, social isolation was significantly related to PTSD symptomatology in the community group. In contrast, depressive symptomatology was accounted for primarily by the exile-related stressors. For the clinical group, depressive symptoms were also accounted for by experiences of war-related loss.

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among Western nations, and is more common in the elderly than in younger individuals. With the general acceptance of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, the current consideration is that colorectal cancer is preventable if all adenomas are removed before they have the chance to progress to cancer. To that end, physicians should now advocate screening for colorectal cancer and through this effort a large number of patients with adenomatous polyps will be discovered. It is important to understand the strategy in dealing with this growing population of patients with adenomas. After an initial polypectomy, patients with adenomas should be entered into a surveillance program to detect and remove recurrent adenomas. Recommended surveillance intervals are shorter for patients with a family history of colorectal cancer, those with multiple adenomas (>2), large adenomas (> or = 1cm), or those whose adenomas have high-grade dysplasia, villous architecture, or that are cancerous. Effective chemoprevention would be a potential method of lengthening colonoscopic surveillance intervals. Unfortunately, no treatment has been found to be effective enough to alter our current surveillance practice. The only recommendation that can be made at this time for those patients with a history of colonic adenomas is to add 3 g/day of calcium carbonate to their diet, though its effect on adenoma recurrence is modest.",

        "Abstract": "Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) has been shown to be an effective therapy for patients with acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but its biologic mechanism is not understood. We reported that clinical response to ECP was associated not only with normalization of skewed CD4/CD8 ratios but also with an increase in CD3(-)/CD56(+) natural killer cells and a decrease in the number of CD80(+) and CD123(+) circulating dendritic cells (DCs). To further elucidate the effects of ECP on activated lymphocyte subpopulations and the interaction between effector lymphocytes and antigen-presenting DCs, we isolated and characterized DC populations from patients with chronic GVHD undergoing ECP therapy. Antigen-presenting activity of DCs was measured as proliferation of antigen-stimulated autologous and allogeneic T cells by mixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR). In MLR assays the proliferation of T cells was decreased in all 10 patients by a mean of 84% (range, 75%-95%; P < or =.002) after a 2-day cycle of ECP and longitudinally over the 12-month course of therapy. Immunophenotypic analysis of DC populations revealed a preponderance of DC1 monocytic dendritic cells in all patients before the initiation of ECP. Nine of 10 patients demonstrated a shift from DC1 to DC2 and as a concordant shift from a predominantly Th1 (interleukin-2 [IL-2], interferon-gamma) to Th2 (IL-4, IL-10) cytokine profile after ECP, and 8 of 10 had a clinical response to ECP. Our results suggest that ECP alters alloreactivity by affecting allo-targeted effector T cells and antigen-presenting DCs.",

        "Abstract": "Supporting glial cells of the peripheral nervous system include satellite cells of dorsal root ganglia and Schwann cells of peripheral nerves. In the central nervous system, glial cells contain enzymes related to the tricarboxylic acid and glutamine cycles: pyruvate carboxylase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and glutamine synthetase. The present study used immunohistochemistry in the rat peripheral nervous system to determine the cellular distribution of these enzymes along with glutamine. In dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves, glutamine and glutamine related enzymes were enriched in satellite and Schwann cells. In the dorsal root ganglia, immunoreactive satellite cells surrounded neurons of all sizes. In peripheral nerve, immunoreactive Schwann cells were most easily observed surrounding large diameter, myelinated axons. These Schwann cells contained immunoreactivity in their cell bodies, nodes of Ranvier, and the rim of cytoplasm outside the myelin sheath. Myelin sheaths were non-immunoreactive. The peripheral glial tricarboxylic and glutamine cycles may be used to produce glutamine for neuronal cell uptake and conversion to glutamate for synaptic transmission. Alternatively, these cycles may function in peripheral glia similar to central nervous system astrocytes for supporting the energy demands of neurons.",

        "Abstract": "We develop a new analysis of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input to a cortical simple cell, demonstrating that this input is the sum of two terms, a linear term and a nonlinear term. In response to a drifting grating, the linear term represents the temporal modulation of input, and the nonlinear term represents the mean input. The nonlinear term, which grows with stimulus contrast, has been neglected in many previous models of simple cell response. We then analyze two scenarios by which contrast-invariance of orientation tuning may arise. In the first scenario, at larger contrasts, the nonlinear part of the LGN input, in combination with strong push-pull inhibition, counteracts the nonlinear effects of cortical spike threshold, giving the result that orientation tuning scales with contrast. In the second scenario, at low contrasts, the nonlinear component of LGN input is negligible, and noise smooths the nonlinearity of spike threshold so that the input-output function approximates a power-law function. These scenarios can be combined to yield contrast-invariant tuning over the full range of stimulus contrast. The model clarifies the contribution of LGN nonlinearities to the orientation tuning of simple cells and demonstrates how these nonlinearities may impact different models of contrast-invariant tuning.",

        "Abstract": "Many phenomenological models of the responses of simple cells in primary visual cortex have concluded that a cell's firing rate should be given by its input raised to a power greater than one. This is known as an expansive power-law nonlinearity. However, intracellular recordings have shown that a different nonlinearity, a linear-threshold function, appears to give a good prediction of firing rate from a cell's low-pass-filtered voltage response. Using a model based on a linear-threshold function, Anderson et al. showed that voltage noise was critical to converting voltage responses with contrast-invariant orientation tuning into spiking responses with contrast-invariant tuning. We present two separate results clarifying the connection between noise-smoothed linear-threshold functions and power-law nonlinearities. First, we prove analytically that a power-law nonlinearity is the only input-output function that converts contrast-invariant input tuning into contrast-invariant spike tuning. Second, we examine simulations of a simple model that assumes instantaneous spike rate is given by a linear-threshold function of voltage and voltage responses include significant noise. We show that the resulting average spike rate is well described by an expansive power law of the average voltage (averaged over multiple trials), provided that average voltage remains less than about 1.5 SDs of the noise above threshold. Finally, we use this model to show that the noise levels recorded by Anderson et al. are consistent with the degree to which the orientation tuning of spiking responses is more sharply tuned relative to the orientation tuning of voltage responses. Thus neuronal noise can robustly generate power-law input-output functions of the form frequently postulated for simple cells.",

The observed thalamocortical and intracortical circuitry codevelop under Hebb-like synaptic plasticity. Hebbian development yields opponent inhibition: inhibition evoked by stimuli anticorrelated with those that excite a cell. Strong opponent inhibition enables recognition of stimulus orientation in a manner invariant to stimulus contrast. These principles may apply to cortex more generally: Hebb-like plasticity can guide layer 4 of any piece of cortex to create opposition between anticorrelated stimulus pairs, and this enables recognition of specific stimulus patterns in a manner invariant to stimulus magnitude. Properties that are invariant across a cortical column are predicted to be those shared by opponent stimulus pairs; this contrasts with the common idea that a column represents cells with similar response properties.",

        "Title": "The ultrastructure of Pyrsonympha and its associated microorganisms.",
        "Abstract": "The termite gut flagellates are of interest because of their unusual motile organelles, their ability to digest cellulose, and their symbiotic relationship with prokaryotes inhabiting the insect gut. This report provides a detailed ultrastructural description of Pyrsonympha from the hind-gut of Reticulitermes flavipes. The motile axostyle is composed of 2,000-4,000 microtubules connected by cross-bridges. At its anterior end, the axostyle is associated with a \"primary row\" of microtubules which is associated with a fibrous network. The \"primary row\" is embedded in a large mass of amorphous, electron-dense material occupying the furthest anterior end of the cell. The basal bodies of the eight flagella are also embedded in this presumptive microtubule-organizing center. The flagella are associated with the cell surface throughout their length. Isolation and reactivation of the axostyle has demonstrated that although ATP dependent motility is inherent in the structure of the axostyle, its proper control may be mediated by the attachment of the axostyle to structures at the anterior end of the cell. Pyrsonympha lacks morphologically distinguishable mitochondria and Golgi complexes. The cell surface is covered by unique, previously underscribed, tubular specializations. Symbiotic microorganisms are observed associated with the cell surface and within the cytoplasm. Wood particles are taken up from the gut fluid by large phagocytic vacuoles formed at the posterior end of the cell. Even during the process of breakdown, the wood is always enclosed within the membrane of the phagocytic vacuole. The Pyrsonympha from Reticulitermes flavipes are not attached to the lining of the hind-gut and do not contain an attachment organelle, unlike the Pyrsonympha from other species of Reticulitermes.",
