        "Abstract": "In this work, we propose methods to examine how the complex interrelationships between clinical symptoms and, separately, brain imaging biomarkers change over time leading up to the diagnosis of a disease in subjects with a known genetic near-certainty of disease. We propose a time-dependent undirected graphical model that ensures temporal and structural smoothness across time-specific networks to examine the trajectories of interactions between markers aligned at the time of disease onset. Specifically, we anchor subjects relative to the time of disease diagnosis (anchoring time) as in a revival process, and we estimate networks at each time point of interest relative to the anchoring time. To use all available data, we apply kernel weights to borrow information across observations that are close to the time of interest. Adaptive lasso weights are introduced to encourage temporal smoothness in edge strength, while a novel elastic fused- ",

        "Abstract": "This paper aims to present and discuss the issues, challenges, and strategies related to recruitment and retention in clinical trials involving participants with chronic pain. The randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) is widely regarded as the gold standard for evaluating clinical interventions. However, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the challenges associated with recruiting and retaining participants. To prioritize the experience of the study population, targeted outreach strategies and a patient-centric approach are necessary. Researchers should consider incorporating recruitment and retention strategies during the study design phase. Implementing multi-pronged recruitment methods, leveraging relationships with community providers, and involving representatives of the patient population are helpful approaches. Effective communication and maintaining a professional environment are vital for optimizing engagement and supporting the successful execution of clinical trials involving participants with chronic pain.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical Research Coordinators (CRCs) are vital collaborators in a clinical research project. They often are the primary liaisons between investigators and human participants in studies and are involved in every aspect of many protocols, including participant recruitment, care (both usual medical care and specific study-related monitoring and procedures), data collection, specimen processing, and follow-up. The Clinical Translational Science Award program, which was created by the National Institutes of Health in 2006, has significantly expanded the venues in which Clinical Research Resource (CRR) - based CRCs are embedded. CRCs functioning in these areas, outside of the research-focused in-patient environment of the CRR, are designated as \"off-site\" CRCs. Many of these locations, such as intensive care units and emergency departments, require that CRCs interact regularly with healthcare providers whose primary functions are focused on providing optimal patient care rather than research and often involving very complex patients. These off-site CRCs require additional training and support outside of the usual research-oriented environment of the CRR. They are required to function within the context of the patient-care team while fostering implementation of collaborative research. This is a description of such a program specifically geared to off-site CRCs with the goal of enhancing the quality of research and experiences of CRCs.",

        "Abstract": "Huntington disease is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, especially of the striatum, and the presence of polyglutamine huntingtin (HTT) inclusions. Although HTT inclusions are most abundant in the neocortex, their neocortical distribution and density in relation to the extent of CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene and striatal pathologic grade have yet to be formally established. We immunohistochemically studied 65 brains with a pathologic diagnosis of Huntington disease to investigate the cortical distributions and densities of HTT inclusions within the calcarine (BA17), precuneus (BA7), motor (BA4) and prefrontal (BA9) cortices; in 39 of these brains, a p62 immunostain was used for comparison. HTT inclusions predominate in the infragranular cortical layers (layers V-VI) and layer III, however, the densities of HTT inclusions across the human cerebral cortex are not uniform but are instead regionally contingent. The density of HTT and p62 inclusions (intranuclear and extranuclear) in layers V-VI increases caudally to rostrally (BA17‚Äâ<‚ÄâBA7‚Äâ<‚ÄâBA4‚Äâ<‚ÄâBA9) with the median burden of HTT inclusions being 38-fold greater in the prefrontal cortex (BA9) than in the calcarine cortex (BA17). Conversely, intranuclear HTT inclusions prevail in the calcarine cortex irrespective of HTT CAG length. Neocortical HTT inclusion density correlates with CAG repeat expansion, but not with the neuropathologic grade of striatal degeneration (Vonsattel grade) or with the duration of clinical disease since motor onset. Extrapolation of these findings suggest that HTT inclusions are at a regionally-contingent, CAG-dependent, density during the advanced stages of HD. The distribution and density of HTT inclusions in HD therefore does not provide a measure of pathologic disease stage but rather infers the degree of pathogenic HTT expansion.",

Assessing cognitive impairment is important for diagnostic, clinical management, and research purposes. The Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most common screening measure of cognitive function, yet this score is not consistently available in the electronic health records. We conducted a pilot study to extract frequently used concepts characterizing cognitive function from the clinical notes of AD patients in an Aging and Dementia clinical practice. Then we developed a model to infer the severity of cognitive impairment and created a subspecialized taxonomy for concepts associated with MMSE scores. We evaluated the taxonomy and the severity prediction model and presented example use cases of this model.",

        "Abstract": "The availability and cost of next-generation sequencing (NSG) now allow testing large numbers of genes simultaneously. However, the gold standard for predictive testing has been to test only for a known family mutation or confirmed family disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the psychological impact of predictive testing for autosomal dominant neurodegenerative diseases without a known family mutation using next-generation sequencing panels compared to single-gene testing of a known family mutation. Fourteen individuals from families with a known mutation and 10 individuals with unknown family mutations participated. Participants completed questionnaires on demographics, genetic knowledge, and psychological measures of anxiety, depression, perceived personal control, rumination, and intolerance to uncertainty at baseline and 1 and 6¬†months after receiving results. Decision regret was measured 1 and 6¬†months after receiving results. Participants completed a modified Huntington disease genetic testing protocol with genetic counseling and neurological and psychological evaluation. Genetic testing of either the known family mutation or an NGS panel of neurodegenerative disease genes was performed. Semi-structured interviews were performed at 6¬†months post-results about their experience. Two-sample t tests were performed on data collected at each time point to identify significant between-group differences in demographic variables, baseline psychological scores, and baseline genetic knowledge scores. Within-group change over time was assessed by a mixed-effects model. Results of this study indicate that NGS panels for predictive testing for neurodegenerative disease are safe and beneficial to participants when performed within a modified HD protocol. Though significant differences in psychological outcomes were found, these differences may have been driven by genetic results and baseline psychological differences between individuals within the groups. Participants did not regret their decision to test and were largely pleased with the testing protocol.",

        "Abstract": "Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease without clearly identified biomarkers for when motor-onset occurs. Current standards to determine motor-onset rely on a clinician's subjective judgment that a patient's extrapyramidal signs are unequivocally associated with Huntington disease. This subjectivity can lead to error which could be overcome using an objective, data-driven metric that determines motor-onset. Recent studies of motor-sign decline-the longitudinal degeneration of motor-ability in patients-have revealed that motor-onset is closely related to an inflection point in its longitudinal trajectory. We propose a nonlinear location-shift marker model that captures this motor-sign decline and assesses how its inflection point is linked to other markers of Huntington disease progression. We propose two estimating procedures to estimate this model and its inflection point: one is a parametric method using nonlinear mixed effects model and the other one is a multi-stage nonparametric approach, which we developed. In an empirical study, the parametric approach was sensitive to correct specification of the mean structure of the longitudinal data. In contrast, our multi-stage nonparametric procedure consistently produced unbiased estimates regardless of the true mean structure. Applying our multi-stage nonparametric estimator to Neurobiological Predictors of Huntington Disease, a large observational study of Huntington disease, leads to earlier prediction of motor-onset compared to the clinician's subjective judgment.",

        "Abstract": "Rates of genetic testing in Huntington disease (HD) are lower than was predicted before direct DNA testing became available. Clinicians often do not have in-depth conversations with people at risk who chose not to test. We queried 733 research subjects who chose not to learn their HD gene status when enrolling in the Prospective Huntington At-Risk Observational Study, carried out between 1999 and 2008. Lack of an effective cure or treatment (66% of subjects) and inability to undo knowledge (66%) were the major reasons cited for choosing not to undergo HD DNA testing. Most subjects were not concerned about the length or burden of the testing process (61% and 59%, respectively). Subjects were optimistic that a treatment to improve symptoms or postpone onset would be developed within the next 10‚Äâyears (56% and 53%, respectively), but they had less certainty about the prospects to prevent HD onset (36%). This is the first large, systematic study of why people at risk for HD choose not to undergo genetic testing. Attitudes about how people at risk for HD approach this life-altering choice should be reassessed as new treatments develop, and as clinical trials now require genetic testing at entry.",

        "Abstract": "Potential disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative disorders need to be introduced prior to the symptomatic stage in order to be effective. However, current diagnosis of neurological disorders mostly rely on measurements of clinical symptoms and thus only identify symptomatic subjects in their late disease course. Thus, it is of interest to select and integrate biomarkers that may reflect early disease-related pathological changes for earlier diagnosis and recruiting pre-sypmtomatic subjects in a prevention clinical trial. Two sources of biological information are relevant to the construction of biomarker signatures for time to disease onset that is subject to right censoring. First, biomarkers' effects on disease onset may vary with a subject's baseline disease stage indicated by a particular marker. Second, biomarkers may be connected through networks, and their effects on disease may be informed by this network structure. To leverage these information, we propose a varying-coefficient hazards model to induce double smoothness over the dimension of the disease stage and over the space of network-structured biomarkers. The distinctive feature of the model is a non-parametric effect that captures non-linear change according to the disease stage and similarity among the effects of linked biomarkers. For estimation and feature selection, we use kernel smoothing of a regularized local partial likelihood and derive an efficient algorithm. Numeric simulations demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in performance and computational efficiency. Finally, the methods are applied to our motivating study, a recently completed study of Huntington's disease (HD), where structural brain imaging measures are used to inform age-at-onset of HD and assist clinical trial design. The analysis offers new insights on the structural network signatures for premanifest HD subjects.",

        "Abstract": "An important goal in clinical and statistical research is properly modeling the distribution for clustered failure times which have a natural intraclass dependency and are subject to censoring. We handle these challenges with a novel approach that does not impose restrictive modeling or distributional assumptions. Using a logit transformation, we relate the distribution for clustered failure times to covariates and a random, subject-specific effect. The covariates are modeled with unknown functional forms, and the random effect may depend on the covariates and have an unknown and unspecified distribution. We introduce pseudovalues to handle censoring and splines for functional covariate effects, and frame the problem into fitting an additive logistic mixed effects model. Unlike existing approaches for fitting such models, we develop semiparametric techniques that estimate the functional model parameters without specifying or estimating the random effect distribution. We show both theoretically and empirically that the resulting estimators are consistent for any choice of random effect distribution and any dependency structure between the random effect and covariates. Last, we illustrate the method's utility in an application to a Huntington's disease study where our method provides new insights into differences between motor and cognitive impairment event times in at-risk subjects.",

A challenge in mega-analysis is estimating the distribution for clustered, potentially censored event times where the dependency structure can introduce bias if ignored. We propose a new proportional odds model with unknown, time-varying coefficients, and random effects. The model directly captures event dependencies, handles censoring using pseudo-values, and permits a simple estimation by transforming the model into an easily estimable additive logistic mixed effect model. Our method consistently estimates the distribution for clustered event times even under covariate-dependent censoring. Applied to three observational studies of Huntington's disease, our method provides, for the first time in the literature, evidence of similar conclusions about motor and cognitive impairments in all studies despite different recruitment criteria.",

We now have the power to predict age-at-onset from subject-specific features like motor and neuroimaging measures. In clinical trials, properly modeling onset age is important, because it improves power calculations and directs clinicians to recruit subjects with certain features. The history of modeling onset, from simple linear and logistic regression to advanced survival models, is discussed. We highlight their advantages and disadvantages, emphasizing the methodological challenges when genetic mutation status is unavailable. We also discuss the potential bias and higher variability incurred from the uncertainty associated with subjective definitions for onset. Methods to adjust for the uncertainty in survival models are still in their infancy, but would be beneficial for HD and neurodegenerative diseases with long prodromal periods like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "In genetic epidemiological studies, family history data are collected on relatives of study participants and used to estimate the age-specific risk of disease for individuals who carry a causal mutation. However, a family member's genotype data may not be collected because of the high cost of in-person interview to obtain blood sample or death of a relative. Previously, efficient nonparametric genotype-specific risk estimation in censored mixture data has been proposed without considering covariates. With multiple predictive risk factors available, risk estimation requires a multivariate model to account for additional covariates that may affect disease risk simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to consider the role of covariates in genotype-specific distribution estimation using family history data. We propose an estimation method that permits more precise risk prediction by controlling for individual characteristics and incorporating interaction effects with missing genotypes in relatives, and thus, gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions can be handled within the framework of a single model. We examine performance of the proposed methods by simulations and apply them to estimate the age-specific cumulative risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in carriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation using first-degree relatives who are at genetic risk for PD. The utility of estimated carrier risk is demonstrated through designing a future clinical trial under various assumptions. Such sample size estimation is seen in the Huntington's disease literature using the length of abnormal expansion of a CAG repeat in the HTT gene but is less common in the PD literature.

        "Title": "Statistical Approaches to Longitudinal Data Analysis in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Huntington's Disease as a Model.",
        "Abstract": "Understanding the overall progression of neurodegenerative diseases is critical to the timing of therapeutic interventions and design of effective clinical trials. Disease progression can be assessed with longitudinal study designs in which outcomes are measured repeatedly over time and are assessed with respect to risk factors, either measured repeatedly or at baseline. Longitudinal data allows researchers to assess temporal disease aspects, but the analysis is complicated by complex correlation structures, irregularly spaced visits, missing data, and mixtures of time-varying and static covariate effects. We review modern statistical methods designed for these challenges. Among all methods, the mixed effect model most flexibly accommodates the challenges and is preferred by the FDA for observational and clinical studies. Examples from Huntington's disease studies are used for clarification, but the methods apply to neurodegenerative diseases in general, particularly as the identification of prodromal forms of neurodegenerative disease through sensitive biomarkers is increasing.",

        "Abstract": "Low CSF Œ≤-amyloid 1-42 has been associated with cognitive decline in advanced Parkinson's disease; data from a single cohort suggest Œ≤-amyloid 1-42 may be an early marker of cognitive impairment. Newly diagnosed Parkinson's participants (mean duration, 6.9 months) in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (n = 341) were assessed at baseline (untreated state) and followed for 2 years. CSF Œ≤-amyloid 1-42, Œ±-synuclein, total tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 were collected at baseline. Participants were classified as having cognitive impairment (CI) if scores on two of six cognitive tests were 1.5 standard deviations below the standardized mean based on published norms in healthy controls. Multivariable regression analyses were used to determine the association between baseline CSF markers with cognitive impairment, defined by neuropsychological testing performance at 2-year follow-up. Fifty-five participants (16.1 %) had CI at baseline and were not included in further analyses. Thirty-seven of the 286 participants without CI at baseline (12.9 %) developed CI at 2 years. Participants with CI at 2 years had significantly lower mean baseline CSF Œ≤-amyloid 1-42 levels than non-CI participants (343.8 vs. 380.4 pg/mL, p < 0.01); no significant difference was seen for Œ±-synuclein, T-tau, or P-tau 181. In a regression model of 286 participants without baseline CI adjusted for age, gender, disease duration, education, motor severity, and depression status, lower baseline Œ≤-amyloid 1-42 levels were associated with higher odds of CI at 2 years. (OR(10pg/mL) = 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.08, p < 0.05). CSF Œ≤-amyloid 1-42 level at disease onset is an independent predictor of cognitive impairment in early Parkinson's disease.",

        "Title": "Variability in interval production is due to timing-dependent deficits in Huntington's disease.",
        "Abstract": "In Huntington's disease (HD), increased variability is seen in performance of motor tasks that require implicit control of timing. We examined whether timing variability was also evident in an explicit interval-timing task. Sixty subjects (21 controls, 19 manifest HD, and 20 pre-manifest HD) performed a single-interval production task with three target intervals (1.1 s, 2.2 s, 3.3 s). We analyzed accuracy (proportional error) and precision (standard deviation) across groups and intervals. No differences were seen in accuracy across groups or intervals. Precision was significantly lower in manifest (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0001) and pre-manifest HD (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04) compared with controls. This was particularly true for pre-manifest subjects close to diagnosis (based on probability of diagnosis in 5 years). Precision was correlated with proximity to diagnosis (r2 ‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.3, P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). To examine the source of reduced precision, we conducted linear regression of standard deviation with interval duration. Slope of the regression was significantly higher in manifest HD (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02) and in pre-manifest HD close to diagnosis (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04) compared with controls and pre-manifest participants far from diagnosis. Timing precision is impaired before clinical diagnosis in Huntington's disease. Slope analysis suggests that timing variability (decreased precision) was attributable to deficits in timing-dependent processes. Our results provide additional support for the proposal that the basal ganglia are implicated in central timekeeping functions. Because the single interval production task was sensitive to deficits in pre-manifest HD, temporal precision may be a useful outcome measure in future clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "Our objective was to explore interest in genetic testing among Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) Parkinson's Disease (PD) cases and first-degree relatives, as genetic testing for LRRK2 G2019S is widely available. Approximately 18¬†% of AJ PD cases carry G2019S mutations; penetrance estimations vary between 24 and 100¬†% by age 80. A Genetic Attitude Questionnaire (GAQ) was administered at two New York sites to PD families unaware of LRRK2 G2019S mutation status. The association of G2019S, age, education, gender and family history of PD with desire for genetic testing (outcome) was modeled using logistic regression. One-hundred eleven PD cases and 77 relatives completed the GAQ. Both PD cases and relatives had excellent PD-specific genetic knowledge. Among PD, 32.6¬†% \"definitely\" and 41.1¬†% \"probably\" wanted testing, if offered \"now.\" Among relatives, 23.6¬†% \"definitely\" and 36.1¬†% \"probably\" wanted testing \"now.\" Desire for testing in relatives increased incrementally based on hypothetical risk of PD. The most important reasons for testing in probands and relatives were: if it influenced medication response, identifying no mutation, and early prevention and treatment. In logistic regression, older age was associated with less desire for testing in probands OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.921 95%CI 0.868-0.977, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.009. Both probands and relatives express interest in genetic testing, despite no link to current treatment or prevention.",

        "Title": "Parkinson disease phenotype in Ashkenazi Jews with and without LRRK2 G2019S mutations.",
        "Abstract": "The phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients with and without leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S mutations reportedly is similar; however, large, uniformly evaluated series are lacking. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical phenotype of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) PD carriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. We studied 553 AJ PD patients, including 65 patients who were previously reported, from three sites (two in New York and one in Tel-Aviv). Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutation carriers were excluded. Evaluations included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS) questionnaire. Regression models were constructed to test the association between clinical and demographic features and LRRK2 status (outcome) in 488 newly recruited participants. LRRK2 G2019S carriers (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ97) and non-carriers (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ391) were similar in age and age at onset of PD. Carriers had longer disease duration (8.6 years vs. 6.1 years; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), were more likely to be women (51.5% vs. 37.9%; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.015), and more often reported first symptoms in the lower extremities (40.0% vs. 19.2%; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). In logistic models that were adjusted for age, disease duration, sex, education, and site, carriers were more likely to have lower extremity onset (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.043), and a persistent levodopa response for >5 years (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.042). Performance on the UPDRS, MoCA, GDS, and NMS did not differ by mutation status. PD in AJ LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers is similar to idiopathic PD but is characterized by more frequent lower extremity involvement at onset and PIGD without the associated cognitive impairment.",

        "Abstract": "The Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale is used to characterize motor impairments and establish motor diagnosis. Little is known about the timing of diagnostic confidence level categories and the trajectory of motor impairments during the prodromal phase. Goals of this study were to estimate the timing of categories, model the prodromal trajectory of motor impairments, estimate the rate of motor impairment change by category, and provide required sample size estimates for a test of efficacy in clinical trials. In total, 1010 gene-expanded participants from the Neurobiological Predictors of Huntington's Disease (PREDICT-HD) trial were analyzed. Accelerated failure time models were used to predict the timing of categories. Linear mixed effects regression was used to model the longitudinal motor trajectories. Age and length of gene expansion were incorporated into all models. The timing of categories varied significantly by gene expansion, with faster progression associated with greater expansion. For the median expansion, the third diagnostic confidence level category was estimated to have a first occurrence 1.5 years before diagnosis, and the second and first categories were estimated to occur 6.75 years and 19.75 years before diagnosis, respectively. Motor impairments displayed a nonlinear prodromal course. The motor impairment rate of change increased as the diagnostic confidence level increased, with added acceleration for higher progression scores. Motor items can detect changes in motor impairments before diagnosis. Given a sufficiently high progression score, there is evidence that the diagnostic confidence level can be used for prodromal staging. Implications for Huntington's disease research and the planning of clinical trials of efficacy are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is increasingly available, but how physicians view it is unclear. Internists are gatekeepers and sources of information, often treating disorders for which PGD is possible. This quantitative study surveyed 220 US internists, who were found to be divided. Many would recommend PGD for cystic fibrosis (CF; 33.7%), breast cancer (BRCA; 23.4%), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; 20.6%) and familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (19.9%), but few for social sex selection (5.2%); however, in each case, >50% were unsure. Of those surveyed, 4.9% have suggested PGD to patients. Only 7.1% felt qualified to answer patient questions about it. Internists who would refer for PGD had completed medical training less recently and, for CF, were more likely to have privately insured patients (P<0.033) and patients who reported genetic discrimination (P<0.013). Physicians more likely to refer for BRCA and FAP were less likely to have patients ask about genetic testing. This study suggests that internists often feel they have insufficient knowledge about it and may refer for PGD based on limited understanding. They view possible uses of PGD differently, partly reflecting varying ages of onset and disease treatability. These data have critical implications for training, research and practice. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) allows embryos to be screened prior to transfer to a woman's womb for various genetic markers. This procedure raises complex medical, social, psychological and ethical issues, but how physicians view it is unclear. Internists are gatekeepers and sources of information, often treating disorders for which PGD use is possible. We surveyed 220 US internists, who were found to be divided: many would recommend PGD for cystic fibrosis (CF; 33.7%), breast cancer (BRCA; 23.4%), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; 20.6%), and familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC; 19.9%) and a few for sex selection (5.2%); but in each case, >50% were unsure.

This quantitative study suggests that internists often feel they have insufficient knowledge and may refer for PGD based on limited understanding. They view possible uses of PGD differently, partly reflecting varying ages of onset and disease treatability. Internists should be made aware of the potential benefit of PGD, but also be taught to refer patients, when appropriate, to clinical geneticists who could then refer the patient to an IVF/PGD team. These data thus have critical implications for training, research and practice.",

        "Abstract": "A number of publications have attributed a tumor suppressive (TS) function to PARKIN, a gene associated with recessive familial early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). Discoveries of PARKIN deletions and point mutations in tumors, functional studies, and data from mouse models have been presented to support the hypothesis. We have asked whether PARKIN mutations are associated with history of cancer in humans. We interviewed 431 participants who were screened for PARKIN mutations, including 149 EOPD cases and their family members, who were unaware of mutation status. We found no significant difference in self-reported history of cancer among carriers of one or two PARKIN mutations and noncarriers, odds ratio 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.27-1.83). In particular, no increase in cancer history was seen among homozygous and compound heterozygous mutation carriers compared to noncarriers. Therefore, we hypothesize that published studies attributing TS capability to PARKIN merit further exploration and we present a reevaluation of these data with respect to patterns of mutation frequencies in normal and cancer cells. We conclude that although Parkin may exert a suppressive effect in mice, further studies are required prior to assigning a TS function to PARKIN in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Many questions remain concerning whether, when, and how physicians order genetic tests, and what factors are involved in their decisions. We surveyed 220 internists from two academic medical centers about their utilization of genetic testing. Rates of genetic utilizations varied widely by disease. Respondents were most likely to have ordered tests for Factor V Leiden (16.8 %), followed by Breast/Ovarian Cancer (15.0 %). In the past 6 months, 65 % had counseled patients on genetic issues, 44 % had ordered genetic tests, 38.5 % had referred patients to a genetic counselor or geneticist, and 27.5 % had received ads from commercial labs for genetic testing. Only 4.5 % had tried to hide or disguise genetic information, and <2 % have had patients report genetic discrimination. Only 53.4 % knew of a geneticist/genetic counselor to whom to refer patients. Most rated their knowledge as very/somewhat poor concerning genetics (73.7 %) and guidelines for genetic testing (87.1 %). Most felt needs for more training on when to order tests (79 %), and how to counsel patients (82 %), interpret results (77.3 %), and maintain privacy (80.6 %). Physicians were more likely to have ordered a genetic test if patients inquired about genetic testing (p <‚Äâ.001), and if physicians had a geneticist/genetic counselor to whom to refer patients (p <‚Äâ.002), had referred patients to a geneticist/genetic counselor in the past 6 months, had more comfort counseling patients about testing (p <‚Äâ.019), counseled patients about genetics, larger practices (p <‚Äâ.032), fewer African-American patients (p <‚Äâ.027), and patients who had reported genetic discrimination (p <‚Äâ.044). In a multiple logistic regression, ordering a genetic test was associated with patients inquiring about testing, having referred patients to a geneticist/genetic counselor and knowing how to order tests. These data suggest that physicians recognize their knowledge deficits, and are interested in training. These findings have important implications for future medical practice, research, and education.",

        "Abstract": "CCL3L1 copy number variation has been implicated as a marker for susceptibility and immunity to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection and its pathogenic sequelae. Some of these findings have been confirmed in several, but not all, subsequent independent cohort studies. A three-fold risk for the development of HIV-associated dementia was reported in individuals possessing a CCL3L1 copy number below the ethnic group median combined with a detrimental CCR5 genotype. With the availability of antiretroviral therapy since 1996, there has been a significant decline in HIV-associated dementia, and milder forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HAND) are now most prevalent. Moreover, patients are living longer with HIV-1 infection and it is recognized that aging may be a contributory factor to the development of cognitive disorder. Thus, the need for biomarkers that can be used in clinical practice to identify and provide optimal treatment for those at increased risk for HAND is great. HAND affects 20%-30% of HIV-infected individuals, and several genetic loci which have been shown to confer susceptibility to HIV infection may also modulate the development of neurocognitive disorder. The aim of this study was to determine whether CCL3L1 chemokine gene copy number in self-defined ethnic groups could differentiate HIV-infected individuals with and without HAND.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine longitudinal change in gait and motor function in pre-manifest Huntington's disease (HD).We examined ten pre-manifest subjects at baseline, one and five years. Quantitative gait data were collected with an electronic mat (GAITRite¬Æ). We analyzed measures related to speed (velocity, step length, cadence), asymmetry (step length difference), dynamic balance (percent time in double support, support base) and variability in stride length and swing time. Motor function was assessed with the motor component of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale.Gait velocity decreased (p=0.001), whereas step length difference (p=0.006), stride length variability (p=0.0001) and swing time variability increased (p=0.0001) from baseline to year five. Step length difference (p<0.05) and swing time variability (p<0.05) increased marginally in one year from baseline. UHDRS Total motor score increased over five years (p=0.003), though the increase in one year was not significant (p=0.053). Of the individual motor domain scores (eye, hand movements, gait and balance, chorea) only dystonia worsened over five years (p=0.02). Total motor score (r2= 0.49, p<0.001) and swing time variability (r2= 0.22, p<0.009) were correlated with estimated years to diagnosis.Our results present the longest longitudinal follow up of gait in pre-manifest HD thus far. Despite the small sample size, quantitative gait analysis was able to detect changes in gait speed, symmetry and variability. Swing time variability was particularly important because it increased in one year from baseline and was correlated with estimated time to diagnosis. Our results highlight the importance of predictive outcomes such as gait variability using quantitative analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Precision grip control is important for accurate object manipulation and requires coordination between horizontal (grip) and vertical (load) fingertip forces. Manifest Huntington's disease (HD) subjects demonstrate excessive and highly variable grip force and delayed coordination between grip and load forces. Because the onset of these impairments is unknown, we examined precision grip control in premanifest HD (pre-HD) subjects. Fifteen pre-HD and 15 age- and sex-matched controls performed the precision grip task in a seated position. Subjects grasped and lifted an object instrumented with a force transducer that measured horizontal grip and vertical load forces. Outcomes were preload time, loading time, maximum grip force, mean static grip force, and variability for all measures. We compared outcomes across groups and correlated grip measures with the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale and predicted age of onset. Variability of maximum grip force (P < .0001) and variability of static grip force (P < .00001) were higher for pre-HD subjects. Preload time (P < .007) and variability of preload time (P < .006) were higher in pre-HD subjects. No differences were seen in loading time across groups. Variability of static grip force (r(2) = 0.23) and variability of preload time (r(2) = 0.59) increased with predicted onset and were correlated with tests of cognitive function. Our results indicate that pre-HD patients have poor regulation of the transition between reach and grasp and higher variability in force application and temporal coordination during the precision grip task. Force and temporal variability may be good markers of disease severity because they were correlated with predicted onset of disease.",

Performance was compared between EOPD probands with (N = 43) and without (N = 52) parkin mutations. The same neuropsychological battery was administered to 217 first-degree relatives to assess neuropsychological function in individuals who carry parkin mutations but do not have PD. No significant differences in neuropsychological test performance were found between parkin carrier and noncarrier probands. Performance also did not differ between EOPD noncarriers and carrier subgroups (i.e., heterozygotes, compound heterozygotes/homozygotes). Similarly, no differences were found among unaffected family members across genotypes. Mean neuropsychological test performance was within normal range in all probands and relatives. Carriers of parkin mutations, whether or not they have PD, do not perform differently on neuropsychological measures as compared to noncarriers. The cognitive functioning of parkin carriers over time warrants further study.",

        "Abstract": "Although current reports document a high rate of obsessive and compulsive symptoms (O/Cs) in Huntington's disease (HD), there have been no studies published that have made an attempt to identify comorbidities of O/Cs in HD. We examined O/Cs in 1642 individuals with a diagnosis of HD. Of those endorsing significant O/Cs (27.2%), nearly one-quarter reported obtaining treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder. Individuals with HD and O/Cs were older, had poorer functioning, and a longer duration of illness than those without O/Cs. Individuals with HD and O/Cs endorsed significantly higher psychiatric comorbidities of depression, suicidal ideation, aggression, delusions, and hallucinations. Participants with the most severe O/Cs and worse performance on the Stroop task, a measure of executive function. Clinicians should be aware that patients with HD and O/Cs might have a somewhat different clinical picture from those without, and may require a specialized treatment plan.",

Investigators have proposed criteria for PD dementia, and mild cognitive impairment. Risk profiles associated with the development of dementia based on demographic, neurological, neuropsychological, imaging, and genetic investigations have been delineated. The FDA has approved a treatment for PDD, and efforts now are directed toward intervention at earlier stages of cognitive impairment.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a genetically complex disorder. Mutations in 3 genes, presenilin 1, amyloid precursor protein, and presenilin 2, lead to early-onset familial AD in rare families with onset of disease occurring prior to age 65. Specific polymorphisms in apolipoprotein E are associated with the more common, late-onset AD occurring after age 65. In this review, we discuss current advances in AD genetics, the implications of the known AD genes, presenilin 1, presenilin 2, amyloid precursor protein, and apolipoprotein E, and other possible genes on the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling of patients and families with early- and late-onset AD.",

        "Abstract": "Depression is one of the most common nonmotor complications of Parkinson's disease (PD) and has a major impact on quality of life. Although several clinical factors have been associated with depression in PD, the relationship between depression and stage of illness as well as between depression and degree of disability remains controversial. We have collected clinical data on 1,378 PD cases from 632 families, using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts II (activities of daily living) & III (motor), the Mini-Mental State Exam, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Blessed Functional Activity Scale (Blessed). Analyses were performed using the 840 individuals with verified PD and without evidence of cognitive decline. Logistic regression was used to identify study variables that individually and collectively best predicted the presence of depressive symptoms (GDS >or= 10). After correcting for multiple tests, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with Hoehn and Yahr stage and other clinical measures but not with any genetic variant (parkin, LRRK2, APOE). The Blessed score, education, presence of a first degree relative with signs of depression, and UPDRS Part II were found to best predict depressive symptomatology (R(2) = 0.33; P = 4 x 10(-48)). Contrary to several reports, the results from this large study indicate that stage of illness, motor impairment, and functional disability are strongly correlated with depressive symptoms.",

        "Abstract": "Weight loss and energy metabolism are important clinical research areas in understanding the disease mechanisms in Huntington's disease. Having an accurate method to estimate expected total energy expenditure would likely facilitate the development of studies about these features of the disease. The Harris-Benedict equation is a formula commonly used to estimate basal energy expenditure of individuals, adjusted for height, weight, age and gender. This estimate is then multiplied by a physical activity factor to estimate total daily energy needs to maintain the given weight. Data from 24-h indirect calorimetry was utilized to derive an adjustment formula for the physical activity factor of the Harris-Benedict equation for 13 early to mid-stage Huntington's disease patients. The adjusted activity factor provided the most accurate estimate of energy needs. This adjusted formula can be used in clinical assessments of Huntington's disease patients, as well as in research studies when indirect calorimetry has not been performed.",

Participants were requested to walk at their preferred speed on a computerized walkway that recorded spatiotemporal variables. We administered the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) for PMC and SHD. PMC demonstrated decreased gait velocity (P < 0.01), stride length (P < 0.008), and increased time in double support (P < 0.001); and demonstrated higher variability in stride length (P < 0.01) and step time (P < 0.004) compared with controls. These impairments worsened with increasing disease severity for SHD. Gait impairments were correlated with predicted years to onset in PMC (velocity = -0.65; cadence = -0.70, step time = 0.71) and demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between controls and mutation carriers. In contrast, UHDRS scores did not reveal impairments in gait and balance. Gait bradykinesia and dynamic balance impairments begin in the presymptomatic stage of HD and continue to worsen in the symptomatic stages. Gait measures are sensitive in differentiating between mutation positive and negative individuals even when impairments were not detected by clinical neurological examination.

        "Abstract": "Mild Parkinsonian signs (MPS, impaired gait, rigidity, bradykinesia, rest tremor) are commonly found during the clinical examination of older people and may be a precursor to Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Marked deficits in olfaction occur in PD and AD. The objective of this study was to determine whether University of Pennsylvania Smell Test (UPSIT) scores were lower in nondemented community-dwelling elderly with versus without MPS. Nondemented persons age >or=65 years without PD in Washington Heights-Inwood, NY were evaluated with an abbreviated motor Unified PD Rating Scale and a 40-item UPSIT. Lower UPSIT and higher transformed UPSIT score (square root [UPSIT - 41]) indicated greater olfactory dysfunction. One-hundred-seventy-seven (16.4%) of 1,078 participants had MPS. Mean UPSIT scores (MPS vs. without MPS) were 24.3 +/- 7.1 versus 26.4 +/- 6.8, P < 0.001. In a logistic regression analysis adjusting for age and education, transformed UPSIT score was associated with MPS (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04-1.52, P = 0.02). In an adjusted logistic regression analysis, participants with higher transformed UPSIT scores (based on a median split) were 1.55 times more likely to have MPS than were those with lower scores (P = 0.01). Within transformed UPSIT score quartiles, the odds of having MPS were 1.0 (reference), 1.35, 2.02, and 2.20 (P < 0.05). The association with transformed UPSIT scores was similar across MPS subtypes (axial dysfunction, rigidity, tremor).MPS were associated with a mild reduction in olfactory function. These observations further support the view of MPS as a marker of emerging degenerative brain pathologies.",

        "Title": "A screening assessment of cognitive impairment in patients with ALS.",
        "Abstract": "We wished to determine whether a screening test battery for cognitive impairment can be given practicably in a busy multidisciplinary ALS clinic, and to assess initial test performance in a sequentially drawn ALS population. We administered a word generation task (letter fluency), the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to 49 ALS patients and their caregivers during a visit to our ALS clinic. We also computed Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale and ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) scores for patients. Pearson correlation coefficients and regression analyses assessed associations between outcome measures. The test battery took 30 min to administer. Word generation was associated with the FBI score (r = -0.36, p = 0.01), and time to ALS diagnosis (p = 0.01). Caregiver depressive symptoms (BDI) correlated with the FBI (r = 0.40, p = 0.005) and motor severity (r = -0.47, p<0.01) in patients. CDR scores were associated with behavioral abnormalities and lower ALSFRS-R scores. We concluded that a screen of cognition could be administered during multidisciplinary ALS clinics. Frontostriatal cognitive impairment may be associated with behavioral syndromes and more rapid forms of ALS. Behavioral and motor impairment is associated with depressive symptoms in caregivers. Studies with formal neuropsychological tests are needed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the screen in ALS.",

        "Abstract": "Patterns of disclosure of Huntington disease risk and genetic test results among family members are important, but have been underexplored. We interviewed 21 individuals in-depth - eight mutation-positive for HD, four mutation-negative, and nine not tested - for 2 hr each. Within families, critical questions arose of what, when, and to whom to disclose, and what to do post-disclosure. Interviewees wrestled with dilemmas of what to tell (e.g., suspicions vs. confirmed symptoms; initiation vs. completion of testing; partial vs. indirect information), how to disclose (e.g., planning in advance vs. \"blurting out\" information in arguments), and whether and how to tell extended family members. Questions arose of when to tell (i.e., to avoid disclosing \"too early\" or \"too late\"). Similarities and differences emerged related to types of relationships (e.g., parents telling offspring vs. offspring telling parents vs. siblings telling each other). Individuals often disclosed because of perceived duty to foster the health of their family members, enabling these others to pursue appropriate medical evaluation, if desired. Yet tensions arose because the information could burden these members, who also have rights to remain \"in denial\" if they wish and not discuss the topic or pursue testing. Post-disclosure, dilemmas emerged of whether and how much to encourage family members to pursue testing. These data shed important light on critical issues that have received little, if any, attention concerning what, how, and when disclosure occurs, and have key implications for at-risk individuals, genetic counselors, and other health care workers (HCWs), and for future research. At-risk individuals would benefit from considering these issues in advance. HCWs need to realize that these decisions are multi-faceted. Future research can explore whether, when, how, and how often HCWs raise these issues with individuals.",

These individuals weighed competing desires and concerns: their own desires vs. those of spouses vs. broader moral concerns (e.g., to end the disease; and/or follow dictates against abortion) vs. perceptions of the interests of current or future offspring. Quandaries arose of how much and to whom to feel responsible. Some changed their perspectives over time (e.g., first \"gambling,\" then being more cautious).

        "Abstract": "Parkin mutations account for the majority of familial and sporadic early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) cases with a known genetic association. More than 100 mutations have been described in the Parkin gene that includes homozygous, compound heterozygous, and single heterozygous mutations. We have designed a Parkin mutation genotyping array (gene chip) that includes published Parkin sequence variants and allows their simultaneous detection. The chip was validated by screening 85 PD cases and 47 controls previously tested for Parkin mutations. Similar genotyping microarrays have been developed for other genetically heterogeneous diseases including age-related macular degeneration. Here, we show the utility of a genotyping array for Parkinson's disease by analysis of 60 subjects from the Genetic Epidemiology of Parkinson Disease (GEPD) study that includes 15 early-onset PD case probands and 45 relatives.",

        "Abstract": "There are no standardized diagnostic criteria for psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease (PDPsy). As part of an NIH sponsored workshop, we reviewed the existing literature on PDPsy to provide criteria that distinguish PDPsy from other causes of psychosis. Based on these data, we propose provisional criteria for PDPsy in the style of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV-TR. PDPsy has a well-characterized temporal and clinical profile of hallucinations and delusions, which is different than the pattern seen in other psychotic disorders such as substance induced psychosis or schizophrenia. PDPsy is associated with a poor prognosis of chronic psychosis, nursing home placement, and death. Medications used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) contribute to PDPsy but may not be sufficient or necessary contributors to PDPsy. PDPsy is associated with Lewy bodies pathology, imbalances of monoaminergic neurotransmitters, and visuospatial processing deficits. These findings suggest that PDPsy may result from progression of the disease process underlying PD, rather than a comorbid psychiatric disorder or drug intoxication. PDPsy is not adequately described by existing criteria for psychotic disorders. We established provisional diagnostic criteria that define a constellation of clinical features not shared by other psychotic syndromes. The criteria are inclusive and contain descriptions of the full range of characteristic symptoms, chronology of onset, duration of symptoms, exclusionary diagnoses, and associated features such as dementia. These criteria require validation and may be refined, but form a starting point for studies of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of PDPsy, and are a potential indication for therapy development.",

The pathophysiology of the disorder is likely a multifactorial process that encompasses derangement of multiple neuronal populations of both subcortical and cortical origin. This process results in a cognitive profile that largely reflects a dysexecutive syndrome. Currently, treatment of PDD is symptomatic. Further research is needed to elucidate the relationship of PDD to DLB and AD in hopes of developing and using appropriate therapeutic measures designed to address the underlying disease process.",

        "Title": "Functional correlates of mild parkinsonian signs in the community-dwelling elderly: poor balance and inability to ambulate independently.",
        "Abstract": "Mild tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (mild parkinsonian signs, MPS) are commonly detected during the clinical examination of elderly people without known neurological disease. The functional correlates of these incidental findings are not well understood. Balance and ability to ambulate independently are important functions in the elderly. The objective of this study is to examine whether MPS were associated with impaired balance. Balance was assessed using a subjective measure (complaint of poor balance) and a functional measure (the need to use a walker, cane, or wheelchair). Our methods included the neurological evaluation of nondemented older people in Washington Heights-Inwood, NY. Of 2,251 participants, 527 (23.4%) complained of poor balance; 538 (23.9%) required a cane, walker, or wheelchair; and 363 (16.1%) had MPS. In adjusted logistic regression analyses, MPS were associated with a complaint of poor balance (OR=1.5, 95% CI=1.1-2.0) and the need to use a cane, walker, or wheelchair (OR=1.9, 95% CI=1.4-2.6). The need to use a cane, walker, or wheelchair was associated with changes in axial function (OR=5.5, 95% CI=2.6-11.6) as well as rigidity (OR=1.5, 95% CI=1.07-2.2). Although they are incidental and subtle, signs of bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor are associated with impaired function. The elderly in whom these signs have been detected are 50% more likely to complain of poor balance and 90% more likely to require a cane, walker, or wheelchair than are their counterparts without these signs.",

        "Abstract": "The natural history of psychiatric syndromes associated with Huntington's disease (HD) remains unclear, and longitudinal studies of symptoms such as depression, apathy, and irritability are required to better understand the progression and role of these syndromes and their effect on disability. Self-administered scales such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) may be useful to document changes in symptoms over time, but the validity of self-report may be questionable with the inevitable progression of cognitive deficits. An alternative to the patient's self-report would be assessments by the caregiver. The authors assessed interrater agreement between patient self-assessment and caregiver assessment of patients status for the presence of depressed mood using the BDI and apathy and irritability using an apathy and irritability scale. Agreement between these scales across strata of cognitive status was also examined. Interrater agreement varied from moderate to good for the BDI, depending on patient cognitive status. Agreement for the apathy scores was low for patients with poor cognition and fair in patients with better cognition. Irritability scale agreement was fair at best and was the worst in patients with the most intact cognition. Caregiver assessment of patients' moods and apathy may be an acceptable alternative to patient self-report as patients' cognitive status worsens.",

        "Abstract": "Gait impairments are very important in Huntington's disease (HD), because loss of independence in gait is an important predictor of nursing home placement. Given this importance, it is imperative to test reliable and sensitive outcome measures that can be tested easily in various clinical environments. Here, we examined the test-retest reliability of gait outcome measures using the GAITRite instrumented carpet. We tested 12 subjects with HD and 12 age-matched controls in two separate sessions. At each session, subjects walked across the GAITRite carpet at a comfortable speed. We used the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CoV) to measure test-retest reliability. Reliability was very high for all outcome measures (velocity, cycle time, stride length, cadence, and base of support), as seen by high ICC scores (0.86 to 0.95) and low CoV scores (0.042-0.102). In addition, the performance across the two subject groups was very different, indicating that the GAITRite is sensitive enough to distinguish between populations. Given that the GAITRite is a relatively inexpensive and portable piece of equipment, it can be used in a wide variety of clinical settings and clinical trials. Our data on high test-retest reliability and sensitivity extends the utility of the GAITRite to the HD population.",

        "Abstract": "Although little is known regarding potential socioeconomic or racial bias in the recording of Parkinson's disease (PD) on death certificates, studies of incidence, prevalence, and the etiology of PD frequently rely on this type of data. A national population-based survey was linked to death certificate data to investigate the concordance of PD reported on death certificates for persons reporting PD during life. Logistic regression was used to identify independent factors associated with differential reporting of PD at death. Among decedents with PD reported during life, 54.8% had PD recorded on the death certificate. Nearly 70% of persons in higher income categories had PD recorded at death compared to 35.4% for those earning $10,000 or less. Age and gender adjusted odds of having PD recorded at death was 2.3 (1.1-3.9), for those with an annual income of $35,000 or more. Income differences remain significant in multivariable models after controlling for age, gender, race, census region, family size, rural residence, and number of chronic medical conditions. In conclusion, this study found socioeconomic bias in the reporting of PD at death. This bias is large enough to confound death certificate-based investigations of incidence, prevalence, and risk factors that differ across socioeconomic strata.",

We analyzed a cohort of 89 EOPD patients (mean age at onset of PD +/- SD, 41.5 +/- 7.2 years), ascertained independent of family history, who participated in a study of the genetic epidemiology of PD. This study includes sequence analysis of the DJ-1 gene in addition to assaying the 14,082-bp deletion spanning exons 1 to 5, previously identified in a Dutch kindred, in 89 EOPD cases. A heterozygous missense mutation in exon 5 (A104T) was identified in an EOPD case of Asian ethnicity; this sequence variant was absent in 308 control chromosomes. We identified additional sequence variation in the DJ-1 gene, including a polymorphism in the coding region in exon 5 (R98Q), three polymorphisms in the 5' untranslated region (exon 1A/1B), and two polymorphisms in intronic regions (IVS1 and IVS5). Mutations in the DJ-1 gene are rare in EOPD in both sporadic and familial cases.",

        "Abstract": "We compared the clinical and neuropsychological pattern of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PD-d). Sixteen patients clinically diagnosed with DLB were compared with two groups of patients with PD-d (n = 15) and AD (n = 16) matched for level of dementia. Isolated cognitive impairment was the most common form of presentation in AD (93.8%) and DLB (31.3%) groups, while parkinsonism was in 100% of PD-d subjects. Psychoses associated with cognitive impairment at the beginning of the disease were more frequent in DLB patients (31.3%) than in AD (6.3%) and PD-d (0%) groups. There were no significant differences in Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor-subscale scores between DLB and PD-d patients. DLB and PD-d patients performed significantly worse on attentional functions and better on memory tests than AD. DLB patients also showed lower scores than AD subjects on visual memory, visuoperceptive, and visuoconstructive tests. No significant differences were found between PD-d group and DLB subjects on any neuropsychological test. We were unable to find any differences in cognitive tasks between PD-d and DLB subjects. Clinical features and neuropsychological deficiencies of DLB (attentional, visuoperceptive, and visuoconstructive deficits) and PD (attentional deficits) compared to AD (amnesic syndrome) can contribute to accurate identification of these entities and to the understanding of the neuropathological and neurochemical substrate underlying these diseases.",

HD is a rare neurodegenerative disease. Like other movement disorders involving the basal ganglia, HD affects motor, cognitive, and psychiatric functioning. The disease follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, with onset of symptoms most commonly occurring in the late 30s or early 40s, as in this patient. HD is caused by an unstable expansion of the trinucleotide CAG, coding for glutamine, on chromosome 4. Despite knowledge of the gene mutation responsible for HD, no definitive treatment is currently available to slow or halt progression of the disease. However, symptomatic treatment can significantly improve the quality of life for patients with HD.",

        "Abstract": "The role of heredity in early- versus late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD) is controversial. We estimated the degree of increased risk of PD in first-degree relatives of 221 PD probands with age of onset 50 years or younger and 266 PD probands with age of onset older than 50 years compared with the first-degree relatives of 409 control probands. Risk of PD was similar among first-degree relatives of early-onset PD probands (risk ratio [RR], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-5.0; p = 0.0002) and late-onset PD probands (RR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.4; p = 0.0002) when each was compared with first-degree relatives of controls. However, siblings of early-onset PD probands were at markedly increased risk of PD compared with siblings of controls (RR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.5-25.5; p = 0.0005), whereas parents of early-onset PD probands were not at significantly increased risk compared with parents of controls (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9-3.3; p = 0.2). In late-onset families, both siblings (RR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.3-10.3; p = 0.02) and parents (RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.6; p = 0.003) were at increased risk compared with control relatives. This pattern is consistent with an autosomal recessive contribution to the inheritance of early but not late-onset PD. Genetic factors are important in both early- and late-onset PD, but specific genes and mode of inheritance may differ between the two groups.",

        "Abstract": "RB, a patient with probable Alzheimer's disease, makes continuous perseverations of single letters when writing (e.g. fruit-->fruuit), particularly on high frequency letters. An analysis of her errors reveals that her perseverations do not reflect letter substitutions or transpositions, nor do they suggest difficulty with geminates. No continuous perseverations were found in oral production, in graphic and simple motor tasks, and in oral spelling. RB's data do not support an attention deficit as the basis of her continuous perseverations. It is proposed that a deficit at the level of abstract letter representations is the source of RB's perseverations. The implications of this conclusion for accounts of perseveration and of spelling models are discussed.",

We found no significant differences in genotype or allele frequencies when LOAD or PD cases were compared to controls. Ethnic differences in STH genotype frequencies for cases and controls were observed and these were statistically significant (cases n=344, P<0.03; controls n=458, P<0.001). We also observed a trend in non-Hispanic white PDD cases with the STH 'QQ' (Tau H1/H1) genotype increased (76%) compared to PD cases without dementia (61.7%) and controls (56.6%); however, this difference was not statistically significant (PDD vs. controls OR 2.1; 95% CI: 0.8-5.8, P=0.2).",

        "Abstract": "We analyzed the association of neuropsychological test impairment at baseline with the development of dementia in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. A cohort of nondemented PD patients from northern Manhattan, NY was followed annually with neurological and neuropsychological evaluations. The neuropsychological battery included tests of verbal and nonverbal memory, orientation, visuospatial ability, language, and abstract reasoning. The association of baseline neuropsychological tests scores with incident dementia was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. The analysis controlled for age, gender, education, duration of PD, and the total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score at baseline. Forty-five out of 164 patients (27%) became demented during a mean follow-up of 3.7 +/- 2.3 years. Four neuropsychological test scores were significantly associated with incident dementia in the Cox model: total immediate recall (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87-0.97, P = 0.001) and delayed recall (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59-0.91, P = 0.005) of the Selective Reminding Test (SRT), letter fluency (RR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.99, P = 0.03), and Identities and Oddities of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73-0.98, P = 0.03). When the analysis was performed excluding patients with a clinical dementia rating of 0.5 (questionable dementia) at baseline evaluation, total immediate recall and delayed recall were still predictive of dementia in PD. Our results indicate that impairment in verbal memory and executive function are associated with the development of dementia in patients with PD.",

        "Title": "Diagnosing Parkinson's disease using videotaped neurological examinations: validity and factors that contribute to incorrect diagnoses.",
        "Abstract": "Field work is commonly required in movement disorders research. Sending neurologists into the field can be logistically challenging and costly. Alternatively, neurological examinations may be videotaped and reviewed later. There is little knowledge of the validity of the videotaped neurological examination in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). We examined the validity of the videotaped Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor examination in the diagnosis of PD, and sought to determine which factors are associated with incorrect diagnoses. PD patients and controls were enrolled in a familial aggregation study between August of 1998 and June of 2000, and as part of that study each was examined by a physician who performed an in-person UPDRS motor examination. Each also underwent a second, videotaped UPDRS motor examination. Based on the review of this videotape, a neurologist, who was blinded to the previous clinical diagnosis, assigned a diagnosis of PD or normal. A total of 211 of 231 PD patients (sensitivity = 91.3%), and 170 of 172 controls (specificity = 98.8%) were correctly identified based on the videotape. True positives had a higher mean rest tremor score (1.7 vs. 0.3; P < 0.001), action tremor score (0.9 vs. 0.3; P < 0.001), bradykinesia score (11.2 vs. 7.4; P = 0.02), and disease of longer mean duration (8.9 vs. 5.8 years; P = 0.001) than false negatives. False negatives did not differ from true positives in terms of age, total dose of levodopa, Hoehn and Yahr score, or rigidity, gait and posture, or facial masking scores (each assessed during the in-person examination). The videotaped UPDRS motor examination is a useful means of diagnosing PD and provides an alternative approach for the diagnosis of PD in field studies. A limitation is that patients with milder PD of shorter duration may not be recognized as PD.",

        "Title": "Combined effect of age and severity on the risk of dementia in Parkinson's disease.",
        "Abstract": "Age and severity of extrapyramidal signs have been consistently associated with incident dementia in Parkinson's disease. We evaluated the separate and combined effects of age and severity of extrapyramidal signs on the risk of incident dementia in Parkinson's disease in the setting of a population-based prospective cohort study. Age and the total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score at baseline evaluation were dichotomized at the median. Four groups of Parkinson's disease patients were defined: younger age/low severity (reference), younger age/high severity, older age/low severity, and older age/high severity. Risk ratios for incident dementia were calculated with Cox proportional hazards models controlling for gender, education, ethnicity, and duration of Parkinson's disease. Of 180 patients, 52 (28.9%) became demented during a mean follow-up period of 3.6 +/- 2.2 years. The median age at baseline of the Parkinson's disease patients was 71.8 years (range, 38.5-95.9 years), and the median total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score was 24 (range, 2-65). The group with older age/high severity had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia (relative risk, 9.7; 95% confidence interval, 3.9-24.4) compared with the group with younger age/low severity (reference), whereas the groups with older age/low severity (relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-4.8) and younger age/high severity (relative risk, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-3.2) did not. These findings suggest that the increased risk of incident dementia in Parkinson's disease associated with age and severity of extrapyramidal signs is related primarily to their combined effect rather than separate effects.",

HAART has been associated with improvements in cognitive performance in some HIV-infected patients. However, it is uncertain whether HAART has changed the frequency of specific neurocognitive abnormalities. Baseline data from 272 HIV-seropositive subjects in the Dana cohort recruited from January, 1994, to December, 1995, and 251 HIV-seropositive subjects in the Northeastern AIDS Dementia Consortium (NEAD) cohort recruited from April, 1998, to August, 1999, were compared. Participants in both cohorts received nearly identical assessments. After adjusting for differences in age, education, gender, race, and CD4 count between the two cohorts, there were no differences in the occurrence of HIV dementia or abnormalities either 1 SD or 2 SDs below established norms for any of the neuropsychological tests. Even though HAART has reduced the incidence of HIV dementia, HIV-associated cognitive impairment continues to be a major clinical problem among individuals with advanced infection.",

        "Abstract": "The extent to which concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) is etiologically related to the development of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains controversial. We explored the association of four risk factors associated with AD, including head injury, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, with incident dementia in PD. A cohort of 180 nondemented PD patients from the Washington Heights community in northern Manhattan, New York, completed a risk factor questionnaire at baseline and was followed annually with neurological and neuropsychological evaluations. The association of baseline variables with incident dementia was analyzed by using Cox proportional hazards models. All analyses controlled for age at baseline, gender, years of education, duration of PD, and total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score at baseline. Of 180 patients (mean age, 71.0 +/- 10.3 years), 52 (29%) became demented during a mean follow-up period of 3.6 +/- 2.2 years. Head injury risk ratio ([RR] 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-2.2; P = 0.9), hypertension (RR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.4-1.4, P = 0.3), and diabetes mellitus (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.3-2.3; P = 0.7) were not significantly associated with incident dementia in the Cox models. Patients who reported having ever smoked were at increased risk for the development of dementia compared with nonsmokers (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0-3.9; P = 0.05). Current smoking was significantly associated with incident dementia (RR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.2-16.4; P = 0.02), whereas past smoking approached significance (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.9-3.7; P = 0.07). Although an inverse association between smoking and PD has been reported in several studies, our study showed a positive association between smoking and dementia in the setting of PD. The association of smoking with incident dementia in PD deserves further study.",
