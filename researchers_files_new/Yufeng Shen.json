        "Abstract": "Accurate prediction of the functional impact of missense variants is important for disease gene discovery, clinical genetic diagnostics, therapeutic strategies, and protein engineering. Previous efforts have focused on predicting a binary pathogenicity classification, but the functional impact of missense variants is multi-dimensional. Pathogenic missense variants in the same gene may act through different modes of action (i.e., gain/loss-of-function) by affecting different aspects of protein function. They may result in distinct clinical conditions that require different treatments. We developed a new method, PreMode, to perform gene-specific mode-of-action predictions. PreMode models effects of coding sequence variants using SE(3)-equivariant graph neural networks on protein sequences and structures. Using the largest-to-date set of missense variants with known modes of action, we showed that PreMode reached state-of-the-art performance in multiple types of mode-of-action predictions by efficient transfer-learning. Additionally, PreMode's prediction of G/LoF variants in a kinase is consistent with inactive-active conformation transition energy changes. Finally, we show that PreMode enables efficient study design of deep mutational scans and optimization in protein engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Rare or de novo variants have substantial contribution to human diseases, but the statistical power to identify risk genes by rare variants is generally low due to rarity of genotype data. Previous studies have shown that risk genes usually have high expression in relevant cell types, although for many conditions the identity of these cell types are largely unknown. Recent efforts in single cell atlas in human and model organisms produced large amount of gene expression data. Here we present VBASS, a Bayesian method that integrates single-cell expression and de novo variant (DNV) data to improve power of disease risk gene discovery. VBASS models disease risk prior as a function of expression profiles, approximated by deep neural networks. It learns the weights of neural networks and parameters of Gamma-Poisson likelihood models of DNV counts jointly from expression and genetics data. On simulated data, VBASS shows proper error rate control and better power than state-of-the-art methods. We applied VBASS to published datasets and identified more candidate risk genes with supports from literature or data from independent cohorts. VBASS can be generalized to integrate other types of functional genomics data in statistical genetics analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become a serious threat to human health. Bone regeneration deficiency and nonunion caused by DM is perceived as a worldwide epidemic, with a very high socioeconomic impact on public health. Here, we find that targeted activation of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor Î± (RORÎ±) by SR1078 in the early stage of bone defect repair can significantly promote in situ bone regeneration of DM rats. Bone regeneration relies on the activation of macrophage RORÎ± in the early bone repair, but RORÎ± of DM rats fails to upregulation as hyperglycemic inflammatory microenvironment induced IGF1-AMPK signalling deficiency. Mechanistic investigations suggest that RORÎ± is vital for macrophage-induced migration and proliferation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) via a CCL3/IL-6 depending manner. In summary, our study identifies RORÎ± expressed in macrophages during the early stage of bone defect repair is crucial for in situ bone regeneration, and offers a novel strategy for bone regeneration therapy and fracture repair in DM patients.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate variant pathogenicity predictions are important in genetic studies of human diseases. Inframe insertion and deletion variants (indels) alter protein sequence and length, but not as deleterious as frameshift indels. Inframe indel Interpretation is challenging due to limitations in the available number of known pathogenic variants for training. Existing prediction methods largely use manually encoded features including conservation, protein structure and function, and allele frequency to infer variant pathogenicity. Recent advances in deep learning modeling of protein sequences and structures provide an opportunity to improve the representation of salient features based on large numbers of protein sequences. We developed a new pathogenicity predictor for SHort Inframe iNsertion and dEletion (SHINE). SHINE uses pretrained protein language models to construct a latent representation of an indel and its protein context from protein sequences and multiple protein sequence alignments, and feeds the latent representation into supervised machine learning models for pathogenicity prediction. We curated training data from ClinVar and gnomAD, and created two test datasets from different sources. SHINE achieved better prediction performance than existing methods for both deletion and insertion variants in these two test datasets. Our work suggests that unsupervised protein language models can provide valuable information about proteins, and new methods based on these models can improve variant interpretation in genetic analyses.",

        "Abstract": "Insufficient bone matrix formation caused by diabetic chronic inflammation can result in bone nonunion, which is perceived as a worldwide epidemic, with a substantial socioeconomic and public health burden. Macrophages in microenvironment orchestrate the inflammation and launch the process of bone remodeling and repair, but aberrant activation of macrophages can drive drastic inflammatory responses during diabetic bone regeneration. In diabetes mellitus, the proliferation of resident macrophages in bone microenvironment is limited, while enhanced myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to increased and constant monocyte recruitment and thus macrophages shift toward the classic pro-inflammatory phenotype, which leads to the deficiency of bone regeneration. In this review, we systematically summarized the anomalous origin of macrophages under diabetic conditions. Moreover, we evaluated the deficit of pro-regeneration macrophages in the diabetic inflammatory microenvironment. Finally, we further discussed the latest developments on strategies based on targeting macrophages to promote diabetic bone regeneration. Briefly, this review aimed to provide a basis for modulating the biological functions of macrophages to accelerate bone regeneration and rescue diabetic fracture healing in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Exome sequencing is widely used in genetic studies of human diseases and clinical genetic diagnosis. Accurate detection of copy number variants (CNVs) is important to fully utilize exome sequencing data. However, exome data are noisy. None of the existing methods alone can achieve both high precision and recall rate. A common practice is to perform heuristic filtration followed by manual inspection of read depth of putative CNVs. This approach does not scale in large studies. To address this issue, we developed a transfer learning method, CNV-espresso, for in silico confirming rare CNVs from exome sequencing data. CNV-espresso encodes candidate CNVs from exome data as images and uses pretrained convolutional neural network models to classify copy number states. We trained CNV-espresso using an offspring-parents trio exome sequencing dataset, with inherited CNVs as positives and CNVs with Mendelian errors as negatives. We evaluated the performance using additional samples that have both exome and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Assuming the CNVs detected from WGS data as a proxy of ground truth, CNV-espresso significantly improves precision while keeping recall almost intact, especially for CNVs that span a small number of exons. CNV-espresso can effectively replace manual inspection of CNVs in large-scale exome sequencing studies.",

Finding genetic causes of CHD can not only shed light on developmental biology of heart, but also provide basis for improving clinical care and interventions. The optimal study design and analytical approaches to identify genetic causes depend on the underlying genetic architecture. A few well-known syndromes with CHD as core conditions, such as Noonan and CHARGE, have known monogenic causes. The genetic causes of most of CHD patients, however, are unknown and likely to be complex. In this review, we highlight recent studies that assume a complex genetic architecture of CHD with two main approaches. One is genomic sequencing studies aiming for identifying rare or de novo risk variants with large genetic effect. The other is genome-wide association studies optimized for common variants with moderate genetic effect.",

        "Abstract": "Pathogenic variants in the CACNA1A gene have been associated with episodic ataxia type 2, familial hemiplegic migraine, and spinocerebellar ataxia 6. With increasing use of clinical genetic testing, associations have expanded to include developmental delay, epilepsy, paroxysmal dystonia, and neuropsychiatric disorders. We report 47 individuals with 33 unique likely pathogenic or pathogenic CACNA1A variants. A machine learning method, funNCion, was used to predict loss-of-function (LoF)/gain-of-function (GoF) impact of genetic variants, and a heuristic severity score was designed to analyze genotype/phenotype correlations. Commonly reported phenotypes include developmental delay/intellectual disability (96%), hemiplegic migraines (36%), episodic ataxia type 2 (32%), epilepsy (55%), autism spectrum disorder (23%), and paroxysmal tonic upward gaze (36%). Severity score was significantly higher for predicted GoF variants, variants in the S5/S6 helices, and the recurrent p.Val1392Met variant. Seizures/status epilepticus were correlated with GoF and were more frequent in those with the p.Val1392Met variant. Our findings demonstrate a breadth of disease severity in CACNA1A-related disease and suggest that the clinical phenotypic heterogeneity likely reflects diverse molecular phenotypes. A better understanding of the natural history of CACNA1A-related disease and genotype/phenotype correlations will help inform prognosis and prepare for future clinical trials.",

        "Title": "Imputing cognitive impairment in SPARK, a large autism cohort.",
        "Abstract": "Diverse large cohorts are necessary for dissecting subtypes of autism, and intellectual disability is one of the most robust endophenotypes for analysis. However, current cognitive assessment methods are not feasible at scale. We developed five commonly used machine learning models to predict cognitive impairment (FSIQ<80 and FSIQ<70) and FSIQ scores among 521 children with autism using parent-reported online surveys in SPARK, and evaluated them in an independent set (nÂ =Â 1346) with a missing data rate up to 70%. We assessed accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity by comparing predicted cognitive levels against clinical IQ data. The elastic-net model has good performance (AUCÂ =Â 0.876, sensitivityÂ =Â 0.772, specificityÂ =Â 0.803) using 129 predictive features to impute cognitive impairment (FSIQ<80). Top-ranked predictive features included parent-reported language and cognitive levels, age at autism diagnosis, and history of services. Prediction of FSIQ<70 and FSIQ scores also showed good performance. We show cognitive levels can be imputed with high accuracy for children with autism, using commonly collected parent-reported data and standardized surveys. The current model offers a method for large-scale autism studies seeking estimates of cognitive ability when standardized psychometric testing is not feasible. LAY SUMMARY: Children with autism who have more severe learning challenges or cognitive impairment have different needs that are important to consider in research studies. When children in our study were missing standardized cognitive testing scores, we were able to use machine learning with other information to correctly \"guess\" when they have cognitive impairment about 80% of the time. We can use this information in research in the future to develop more appropriate treatments for children with autism and cognitive impairment.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate pathogenicity prediction of missense variants is critically important in genetic studies and clinical diagnosis. Previously published prediction methods have facilitated the interpretation of missense variants but have limited performance. Here, we describe MVP (Missense Variant Pathogenicity prediction), a new prediction method that uses deep residual network to leverage large training data sets and many correlated predictors. We train the model separately in genes that are intolerant of loss of function variants and the ones that are tolerant in order to take account of potentially different genetic effect size and mode of action. We compile cancer mutation hotspots and de novo variants from developmental disorders for benchmarking. Overall, MVP achieves better performance in prioritizing pathogenic missense variants than previous methods, especially in genes tolerant of loss of function variants. Finally, using MVP, we estimate that de novo coding variants contribute to 7.8% of isolated congenital heart disease, nearly doubling previous estimates.",

Producing zeolite crystals with sizes less than 100ânm, however, is non-trivial, often requires the use of complex organics and typically results in a small product yield. Here we present an alternative, facile approach to enhance the mass-transport properties of zeolites by the epitaxial growth of fin-like protrusions on seed crystals. We validate this generalizable methodology on two common zeolites and confirm that fins are in crystallographic registry with the underlying seeds, and that secondary growth does not impede access to the micropores. Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin. This approach could be extended to the rational synthesis of other zeolite and aluminosilicate materials.",

In this paper, we evaluate the use of genomic test reports ordered for cancer patients in order to derive cancer subtypes and to identify biological pathways predictive of poor survival outcomes. A novel method is proposed to calculate patient similarity based on affected biological pathways rather than gene mutations. We demonstrate that this approach identifies subtypes of prognostic value and biological pathways linked to survival, with implications for precision treatment selection and a better understanding of the underlying disease. We also share lessons learned regarding the opportunities and challenges of secondary use of observational genomic data to conduct such research.",

        "Abstract": "We report a novel technical approach for subcritical fluid extraction (SFE) for organic matter characterization in complex matrices such as soil. The custom platform combines on-line SFE with micro-solid phase extraction, nano liquid chromatography (LC), electrospray ionization and Fourier transform mass spectrometry (SFE-LC-FTMS). We demonstrated the utility of SFE-LC-FTMS, including results from both Orbitrap and FTICR MS, for analysis of complex mixtures of organic compounds in a solid matrix by characterizing soil organic matter in peat, a high-carbon soil. For example, in a single experiment, >6000 molecular formulas can be assigned based upon FTICR MS data from 1-50 Î¼L of soil samples (roughly 1-50 mg of soil, dependent on soil density), nearly twice that typically obtained from direct infusion liquid solvent extraction (LSE) from an order of magnitude larger volume of the same soil. The detected species consisted predominately of lipid-like, lignin-like and protein-like compounds, based on their O/C and H/C ratios, with predominantly CHO and CHONP molecular compositions. These results clearly demonstrate that SFE has the potential to effectively extract a variety of molecular species and could become an important member of a suite of extraction methods for studying SOM and other natural organic matter. This is especially true when comprehensive coverage, minimal sample volumes, and high sensitivity are required, or when the presence of organic solvent residue in residual soil is problematic. The SFE based extraction protocol could potentially enable spatially resolved characterization of organic matter in soil with a resolution of â¼1 mm3 to facilitate studies probing the spatial heterogeneity of soil.",

        "Title": "De novo variants in congenital diaphragmatic hernia identify MYRF as a new syndrome and reveal genetic overlaps with other developmental disorders.",
        "Abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a severe birth defect that is often accompanied by other congenital anomalies. Previous exome sequencing studies for CDH have supported a role of de novo damaging variants but did not identify any recurrently mutated genes. To investigate further the genetics of CDH, we analyzed de novo coding variants in 362 proband-parent trios including 271 new trios reported in this study. We identified four unrelated individuals with damaging de novo variants in MYRF (P = 5.3x10(-8)), including one likely gene-disrupting (LGD) and three deleterious missense (D-mis) variants. Eight additional individuals with de novo LGD or missense variants were identified from our other genetic studies or from the literature. Common phenotypes of MYRF de novo variant carriers include CDH, congenital heart disease and genitourinary abnormalities, suggesting that it represents a novel syndrome. MYRF is a membrane associated transcriptional factor highly expressed in developing diaphragm and is depleted of LGD variants in the general population. All de novo missense variants aggregated in two functional protein domains. Analyzing the transcriptome of patient-derived diaphragm fibroblast cells suggest that disease associated variants abolish the transcription factor activity. Furthermore, we showed that the remaining genes with damaging variants in CDH significantly overlap with genes implicated in other developmental disorders. Gene expression patterns and patient phenotypes support pleiotropic effects of damaging variants in these genes on CDH and other developmental disorders. Finally, functional enrichment analysis implicates the disruption of regulation of gene expression, kinase activities, intra-cellular signaling, and cytoskeleton organization as pathogenic mechanisms in CDH.",

        "Abstract": "Alloreactive T lymphocytes are the primary mediators of immune responses in transplantation, both in the graft-versus-host and host-versus-graft directions. While essentially all clones comprising the human T cell repertoire have been selected on self-peptide presented by self-human leukocyte antigens (self-HLAs), much remains to be understood about the nature of clones capable of responding to allo-HLA molecules. Quantitative tools to study these cells are critical to understand fundamental features of this important response; however, the large size and diversity of the alloreactive T cell repertoire in humans presents a great technical challenge. We have developed a high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing approach to characterize the human alloresponse. We present a statistical method to model T cell clonal frequency distribution and quantify repertoire diversity. Using these approaches, we measured the diversity and frequency of distinct alloreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in HLA-mismatched responder-stimulator pairs. Our findings indicate that the alloimmune repertoire is highly specific for a given pair of individuals, that most alloreactive clones circulate at low frequencies, and that a high proportion of TCRs is likely able to recognize alloantigens.",

        "Abstract": "Haploinsufficiency is a major mechanism of genetic risk in developmental disorders. Accurate prediction of haploinsufficient genes is essential for prioritizing and interpreting deleterious variants in genetic studies. Current methods based on mutation intolerance in population data suffer from inadequate power for genes with short transcripts. Here we show haploinsufficiency is strongly associated with epigenomic patterns, and develop a computational method (Episcore) to predict haploinsufficiency leveraging epigenomic data from a broad range of tissue and cell types by machine learning methods. Based on data from recent exome sequencing studies on developmental disorders, Episcore achieves better performance in prioritizing likely-gene-disrupting (LGD) de novo variants than current methods. We further show that Episcore is less-biased by gene size, and complementary to mutation intolerance metrics for prioritizing LGD variants. Our approach enables new applications of epigenomic data and facilitates discovery and interpretation of novel risk variants implicated in developmental disorders.",

Here, we report on the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of thirty-nine coumarin derivatives in order to solve the antibacterial resistance by targeting at the inhibition of biosynthesis pathway of fatty acids. Their antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Flavobacterium cloumnare are tested and action mechanism against the key enzyme in bacterial fatty acid synthesis pathway are studied. The results show that compounds 13 and 18 have potent and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. In addition, 9, 14 and 19 show eminent antimicrobial efficacy toward S.Â aureus, S.Â agalactiae, and F.Â cloumnare. Mechanistically, coumarin derivatives display the antibacterial activity via the control of FabI and FabK function. The structure-activity relationship analysis indicate that the length of linker and imidazole substitute group could significantly influence the antimicrobial activity, as well as the inhibitory activity against FabI and FabK. The structural optimization analysis of coumarin suggest that derivatives 9, 13, 14, 18 and 19 could be a viable way of preventing and controlling bacteria and considered as promising lead compounds for the development of commercial drugs.",

        "Title": "Optimized Synthesis of ZSM-11 Catalysts using 1,8-Diaminooctane as a Structure-Directing Agent.",
        "Abstract": "Developing new zeolite catalysts for (petro)chemical applications is nontrivial owing to challenges that include the identification of commercially-viable syntheses. The vast majority of syntheses require the use of an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA), which has economic and environmental shortcomings. In the search for alternative zeolites to common industrial catalysts, such as ZSM-5 (MFI), a promising candidate is ZSM-11 (MEL), a close structural analogue of MFI. ZSM-11 is comprised of 3-dimensional straight channels that have less diffusion limitations than MFI. Side-by-side comparisons of ZSM-11 and ZSM-5 catalysts reveal the former exhibits significantly longer time-on-stream lifetime in many reactions; however, there are several difficulties associated with the preparation of ZSM-11, which include the ability to identify inexpensive OSDAs that produce small crystals in high yield. Here, we examine ZSM-11 synthesis using 1,8-diaminooctane (DAO), which produces ZSM-11 crystals with sizes of ca. 300ânm. We demonstrate that the use of MEL seeds allows for an order of magnitude reduction in the quantity of DAO without sacrificing crystal purity or yield (>80â%). Catalytic tests using methanol to hydrocarbons as a representative reaction show that H-ZSM-11 lifetime and selectivity are similar for samples prepared with and without seeds. Collectively our findings highlight an efficient method to produce ZSM-11 as a potential alternative to ZSM-5 for catalytic applications.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies of somatic and germline mutations have led to the identification of a number of factors that influence point mutation rates, including CpG methylation, expression levels, replication timing, and GC content. Intriguingly, some of the effects appear to differ between soma and germline: in particular, whereas mutation rates have been reported to decrease with expression levels in tumors, no clear effect has been detected in the germline. Distinct approaches were taken to analyze the data, however, so it is hard to know whether these apparent differences are real. To enable a cleaner comparison, we considered a statistical model in which the mutation rate of a coding region is predicted by GC content, expression levels, replication timing, and two histone repressive marks. We applied this model to both a set of germline mutations identified in exomes and to exonic somatic mutations in four types of tumors. Most determinants of mutations are shared: notably, we detected an effect of expression levels on both germline and somatic mutation rates. Moreover, in all tissues considered, higher expression levels are associated with greater strand asymmetry of mutations. However, mutation rates increase with expression levels in testis (and, more tentatively, in ovary), whereas they decrease with expression levels in somatic tissues. This contrast points to differences in damage or repair rates during transcription in soma and germline.",

        "Abstract": "Separation of proteoforms for global intact protein analysis (i.e. top-down proteomics) has lagged well behind what is achievable for peptides in traditional bottom-up proteomic approach and is becoming a true bottle neck for top-down proteomics. Herein, we report use of long (â¥1M) columns containing short alkyl (C1-C4) bonded phases to achieve high-resolution RPLC for separation of proteoforms. At a specific operation pressure limit (i.e., 96.5MPa or 14Kpsi used in this work), column length was found to be the most important factor for achieving maximal resolution separation of proteins when 1.5-5Î¼m particles were used as packings and long columns provided peak capacities greater than 400 for proteoforms derived from a global cell lysate with molecular weights below 50kDa. Larger proteoforms (50-110kDa) were chromatographed on long RPLC columns and detected by MS; however, they cannot be identified yet by tandem mass spectrometry. Our experimental data further demonstrated that long alkyl (e.g., C8 and C18) bonded particles provided high-resolution RPLC for <10kDa proteoforms, not efficient for separation of global proteoforms. Reversed-phase particles with porous, nonporous, and superficially porous surfaces were systematically investigated for high-resolution RPLC. Pore size (200-400Ã) and the surface structure (porous and superficially porous) of particles was found to have minor influences on high-resolution RPLC of proteoforms. RPLC presented herein enabled confident identification of â¼900 proteoforms (1% FDR) for a low-microgram quantity of proteomic samples using a single RPLC-MS/MS analysis. The level of RPLC performance attained in this work is close to that typically realized in bottom-up proteomics, and broadly useful when applying e.g., the single-stage MS accurate mass tag approach, but less effective when combined with current tandem MS. Our initial data indicate that MS detection and fragmentation inefficiencies provided by current high-resolution mass spectrometers are key challenges for characterization of larger proteoforms.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have identified many genes with rare de novo mutations in autism, but a limited number of these have been conclusively established as disease-susceptibility genes due to the lack of recurrence and confounding background mutations. Such extreme genetic heterogeneity severely limits recurrence-based statistical power even in studies with a large sample size. Here, we use cell-type specific expression profiles to differentiate mutations in autism patients from those in unaffected siblings. We report a gene expression signature in different neuronal cell types shared by genes with likely gene-disrupting (LGD) mutations in autism cases. This signature reflects haploinsufficiency of risk genes enriched in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators, with the strongest positive associations with specific types of neurons in different brain regions, including cortical neurons, cerebellar granule cells, and striatal medium spiny neurons. When used to prioritize genes with a single LGD mutation in cases, a D-score derived from the signature achieved a precision of 40% as compared with the 15% baseline with a minimal loss in sensitivity. An ensemble model combining D-score with mutation intolerance metrics from Exome Aggregation Consortium further improved the precision to 60%, resulting in 117 high-priority candidates. These prioritized lists can facilitate identification of additional autism-susceptibility genes.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer and developmental disorders (DDs) share dysregulated cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. There are well-known genes implicated in both in cancer and DDs. In this study, we aim to quantify this genetic connection using publicly available data. We found that among DD patients, germline damaging de novo variants are more enriched in cancer driver genes than non-drivers. We estimate that cancer driver genes comprise about a third of DD risk genes. Additionally, de novo likely-gene-disrupting variants are more enriched in tumor suppressors, and about 40% of implicated de novo damaging missense variants are located in cancer somatic mutation hotspots, indicating that many genes have a similar mode of action in cancer and DDs. Our results suggest that we can view tumors as natural laboratories for assessing the deleterious effects of mutations that are applicable to germline variants and identification of causal genes and variants in DDs.",

Exome sequencing of 1213 CHD parent-offspring trios identified an excess of protein-damaging de novo mutations, especially in genes highly expressed in the developing heart and brain. These mutations accounted for 20% of patients with CHD, NDD, and CA but only 2% of patients with isolated CHD. Mutations altered genes involved in morphogenesis, chromatin modification, and transcriptional regulation, including multiple mutations in RBFOX2, a regulator of mRNA splicing. Genes mutated in other cohorts examined for NDD were enriched in CHD cases, particularly those with coexisting NDD. These findings reveal shared genetic contributions to CHD, NDD, and CA and provide opportunities for improved prognostic assessment and early therapeutic intervention in CHD patients.",

        "Abstract": "Alloreactive T lymphocytes are the primary mediators of allograft rejection. The size and diversity of the HLA-alloreactive T cell repertoire has thus far precluded the ability to follow these T cells and thereby to understand their fate in human transplant recipients. This review summarizes the history, challenges, and recent advances in the study of alloreactive T cells. We highlight the historical development of assays to measure alloreactivity and discuss how high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing-based assays can provide a new window into the fate of alloreactive T cells in human transplant recipients. A specific approach combining a classical in vitro assay, the mixed lymphocyte reaction, with deep T cell receptor sequencing is described as a tool to track the donor-reactive T cell repertoire for any specific HLA-mismatched donor-recipient pair. This assay can provide mechanistic insights and has potential as a noninvasive, highly specific biomarker for rejection and tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has greatly helped us identify disease-contributory variants for Mendelian diseases. However, users are often faced with issues such as software compatibility, complicated configuration, and no access to high-performance computing facility. Discrepancies exist among aligners and variant callers. We developed a computational pipeline, SeqMule, to perform automated variant calling from NGS data on human genomes and exomes. SeqMule integrates computational-cluster-free parallelization capability built on top of the variant callers, and facilitates normalization/intersection of variant calls to generate consensus set with high confidence. SeqMule integrates 5 alignment tools, 5 variant calling algorithms and accepts various combinations all by one-line command, therefore allowing highly flexible yet fully automated variant calling. In a modern machine (2 Intel Xeon X5650 CPUs, 48 GB memory), when fast turn-around is needed, SeqMule generates annotated VCF files in a day from a 30X whole-genome sequencing data set; when more accurate calling is needed, SeqMule generates consensus call set that improves over single callers, as measured by both Mendelian error rate and consistency. SeqMule supports Sun Grid Engine for parallel processing, offers turn-key solution for deployment on Amazon Web Services, allows quality check, Mendelian error check, consistency evaluation, HTML-based reports. SeqMule is available at http://seqmule.openbioinformatics.org.",

        "Abstract": "Cooperative systems are susceptible to invasion byÂ selfish individuals that profit from receiving the social benefits but fail to contribute. These so-called \"cheaters\" can have a fitness advantage in the laboratory, but it is unclear whether cheating provides an important selective advantage in nature. We used a population genomic approach to examine the history of genes involved in cheating behaviors in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, testing whether these genes experience rapid evolutionary change as a result of conflict over spore-stalk fate. Candidate genes and surrounding regions showed elevated polymorphism, unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and lower levels of population differentiation, but they did not show greater between-species divergence. The signatures were most consistent with frequency-dependent selection acting to maintain multiple alleles, suggesting that conflict may lead to stalemate rather than an escalating arms race. Our results reveal the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation and cheating and underscore how sequence-based approaches can be used to elucidate the history of conflicts that are difficult to observe directly.",

        "Abstract": "Recent genome-wide association studies identified certain human leukocyote antigen (HLA) alleles as the major risk factors of drug-induced liver injuries (DILI). While these alleles often cause large relative risk, their predictive values are quite low due to low prevalence of idiosyncratic DILI. Finding additional risk factors is important for precision medicine. However, optimal design of further genetic studies is hindered by uncertain overall heritability of DILI. This is a common problem for low-prevalence pharmacological traits, since it is difficult to obtain clinical outcome data in families. Here we estimated the heritability (h(2)) of DILI from case-control genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data using a method based on random effect models. We estimated the proportion of h(2) captured by common SNPs for DILI to be between 0.3 and 0.5. For co-amoxiclav induced DILI, chromosome 6 explained part of the heritability, indicating additional contributions from common variants yet to be found. We performed simulations to assess the robustness of the h(2) estimate with limited sample size under low prevelance, a condition typical to studies on idiosyncratic pharmacological traits. Our findings suggest that common variants outside of HLA contribute to DILI susceptability; therefore, it is valuable to conduct further GWAS with expanded case collection.",

        "Abstract": "We present CANOES, an algorithm for the detection of rare copy number variants from exome sequencing data. CANOES models read counts using a negative binomial distribution and estimates variance of the read counts using a regression-based approach based on selected reference samples in a given dataset. We test CANOES on a family-based exome sequencing dataset, and show that its sensitivity and specificity is comparable to that of XHMM. Moreover, the method is complementary to Gaussian approximation-based methods (e.g. XHMM or CoNIFER). When CANOES is used in combination with these methods, it will be possible to produce high accuracy calls, as demonstrated by a much reduced and more realistic de novo rate in results from trio data.",

High-pH reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), followed by fraction concatenation, affords better peptide analysis than conventional strong cation-exchange chromatography applied for 2D proteomic analysis. For example, concatenated high-pH RPLC increased identification of peptides (by 1.8-fold) and proteins (by 1.6-fold) in shotgun proteomics analyses of a digested human protein sample. Additional advantages of high-pH RPLC with fraction concatenation include improved protein sequence coverage, simplified sample processing and reduced sample losses, making this an attractive alternative to strong cation-exchange chromatography in conjunction with second-dimension low-pH RPLC for 2D proteomics analyses.",

        "Abstract": "MS dissociation methods, including collision induced dissociation (CID), high energy collision dissociation (HCD), and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), can each contribute distinct peptidome identifications using conventional peptide identification methods (Shen et al. J. Proteome Res. 2011), but such samples still pose significant informatics challenges. In this work, we explored utilization of high accuracy fragment ion mass measurements, in this case provided by Fourier transform MS/MS, to improve peptidome peptide data set size and consistency relative to conventional descriptive and probabilistic scoring methods. For example, we identified 20-40% more peptides than SEQUEST, Mascot, and MS_GF scoring methods using high accuracy fragment ion information and the same false discovery rate (FDR) from CID, HCD, and ETD spectra. Identified species covered >90% of the collective identifications obtained using various conventional peptide identification methods, which significantly addresses the common issue of different data analysis methods generating different peptide data sets. Choice of peptide dissociation and high-precision measurement-based identification methods presently available for degradomic-peptidomic analyses needs to be based on the coverage and confidence (or specificity) afforded by the method, as well as practical issues (e.g., throughput). By using accurate fragment information, >1000 peptidome components can be identified from a single human blood plasma analysis with low peptide-level FDRs (e.g., 0.6%), providing an improved basis for investigating potential disease-related peptidome components.",

        "Abstract": "In the last two years, because of advances in protein separation and mass spectrometry, top-down mass spectrometry moved from analyzing single proteins to analyzing complex samples and identifying hundreds and even thousands of proteins. However, computational tools for database search of top-down spectra against protein databases are still in their infancy. We describe MS-Align+, a fast algorithm for top-down protein identification based on spectral alignment that enables searches for unexpected post-translational modifications. We also propose a method for evaluating statistical significance of top-down protein identifications and further benchmark various software tools on two top-down data sets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium. We demonstrate that MS-Align+ significantly increases the number of identified spectra as compared with MASCOT and OMSSA on both data sets. Although MS-Align+ and ProSightPC have similar performance on the Salmonella typhimurium data set, MS-Align+ outperforms ProSightPC on the (more complex) Saccharomyces cerevisiae data set.",

        "Title": "Effectiveness of CID, HCD, and ETD with FT MS/MS for degradomic-peptidomic analysis: comparison of peptide identification methods.",
        "Abstract": "We report on the effectiveness of CID, HCD, and ETD for LC-FT MS/MS analysis of peptides using a tandem linear ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. A range of software tools and analysis parameters were employed to explore the use of CID, HCD, and ETD to identify peptides (isolated from human blood plasma) without the use of specific \"enzyme rules\". In the evaluation of an FDR-controlled SEQUEST scoring method, the use of accurate masses for fragments increased the number of identified peptides (by ~50%) compared to the use of conventional low accuracy fragment mass information, and CID provided the largest contribution to the identified peptide data sets compared to HCD and ETD. The FDR-controlled Mascot scoring method provided significantly fewer peptide identifications than SEQUEST (by 1.3-2.3 fold) and CID, HCD, and ETD provided similar contributions to identified peptides. Evaluation of de novo sequencing and the UStags method for more intense fragment ions revealed that HCD afforded more contiguous residues (e.g., â¥ 7 amino acids) than either CID or ETD. Both the FDR-controlled SEQUEST and Mascot scoring methods provided peptide data sets that were affected by the decoy database used and mass tolerances applied (e.g., identical peptides between data sets could be limited to ~70%), while the UStags method provided the most consistent peptide data sets (>90% overlap). The m/z ranges in which CID, HCD, and ETD contributed the largest number of peptide identifications were substantially overlapping. This work suggests that the three peptide ion fragmentation methods are complementary and that maximizing the number of peptide identifications benefits significantly from a careful match with the informatics tools and methods applied. These results also suggest that the decoy strategy may inaccurately estimate identification FDRs.",

        "Abstract": "Disulfide bonds are a form of post-translational modification that often determines protein structure(s) and function(s). In this work, we report a mass spectrometry method for identification of disulfides in degradation products of proteins, specifically endogenous peptides in the human blood plasma peptidome. LC-Fourier transform tandem mass spectrometry (FT MS/MS) was used for acquiring mass spectra that were de novo sequenced and then searched against the IPI human protein database. Through the use of unique sequence tags (UStags), we unambiguously correlated the spectra to specific database proteins. Examination of the UStags' prefix and/or suffix sequences that contain cysteine(s) in conjunction with sequences of the UStags-specified database proteins is shown to enable the unambigious determination of disulfide bonds. Using this method, we identified the intermolecular and intramolecular disulfides in human blood plasma peptidome peptides that have molecular weights of up to approximately 10 kDa.",

        "Abstract": "Herein we describe a strategy for degradomic-peptidomic analyses. The human blood peptidome was isolated through application of AC/SEC, which enriched its components by >300-fold. The isolated peptidome components were separated by long column HRLC providing a peak capacity of approximately 300 for species having MWs of up to 20 kDa. The separated species were identified by the FT MS/MS-UStags sequencing method. We identified >200 peptidome components that originated from 29 protein substrates from the blood plasma of a single healthy person. The peptidome peptides identified had MWs range of 0.5-14 kDa and identifications were achieved with extremely low (near zero) false discovery rates through searching the IPI human protein database (approximately 70,000 entries). Some of the peptidome peptides identified have mutations and modifications such as acetylation, acetylhexosamine, amidation, cysteinylation, didehydro, oxidation, and pyro-glu. The capabilities described enable the global analysis of the peptidome peptides to identify degradome targets such as degradome proteases, proteases inhibitors, and other relevant substrates, the cleavage specificities for the degradation of individual substrates, as well as a potential basis for using the various extents of substrate degradation for diagnostic purposes.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate identification of genetic variants from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is essential for immediate large-scale genomic endeavors such as the 1000 Genomes Project, and is crucial for further genetic analysis based on the discoveries. The key challenge in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery is to distinguish true individual variants (occurring at a low frequency) from sequencing errors (often occurring at frequencies orders of magnitude higher). Therefore, knowledge of the error probabilities of base calls is essential. We have developed Atlas-SNP2, a computational tool that detects and accounts for systematic sequencing errors caused by context-related variables in a logistic regression model learned from training data sets. Subsequently, it estimates the posterior error probability for each substitution through a Bayesian formula that integrates prior knowledge of the overall sequencing error probability and the estimated SNP rate with the results from the logistic regression model for the given substitutions. The estimated posterior SNP probability can be used to distinguish true SNPs from sequencing errors. Validation results show that Atlas-SNP2 achieves a false-positive rate of lower than 10%, with an approximately 5% or lower false-negative rate.",

The system employs a multiple-column capillary LC fluidic design developed for high-throughput analysis of peptides (Anal. Chem. 2001, 73, 3011-3021), incorporating modifications to achieve broad and sensitive analysis of phosphopeptides. The integrated nanoLC columns (50 microm i.d. x 30 cm containing 5 microm C18 particles) and the on-line solid phase extraction columns (150 microm i.d. x 4 cm containing 5 microm C18 particles) were connected to automatic switching valves with non-metal chromatographic accessories, and other modifications to avoid the exposure of the analyte to any metal surfaces during handling, separation, and electrospray ionization. The nanoLC developed provided a separation peak capacity of approximately 250 for phosphopeptides (and approximately 400 for normal peptides). A detection limit of 0.4 fmol was obtained when a linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometer (Finnegan LTQ) was coupled to a 50-microm i.d. column of the nanoLC. The separation power and sensitivity provided by the nanoLC-LTQ enabled identification of approximately 4600 phosphopeptide candidates from approximately 60 microg COS-7 cell tryptic digest followed by IMAC enrichment and approximately 520 tyrosine phosphopeptides from approximately 2mg of human T cells digests followed by phosphotyrosine peptide immunoprecipitation.",

        "Abstract": "De novo sequencing is a spectrum analysis approach for mass spectrometry data to discover post-translational modifications in proteins; however, such an approach is still in its infancy and is still not widely applied to proteomic practices due to its limited reliability. In this work, we describe a de novo sequencing approach for the discovery of protein modifications based on identification of the proteome UStags (Shen, Y.; ToliÄ, N.; Hixson, K. K.; Purvine, S. O.; Pasa-ToliÄ, L.; Qian, W. J.; Adkins, J. N.; Moore, R. J.; Smith, R. D. Anal. Chem. 2008, 80, 1871-1882). The de novo information was obtained from Fourier-transform tandem mass spectrometry data for peptides and polypeptides from a yeast lysate, and the de novo sequences obtained were selected based on filter levels designed to provide a limited yet high quality subset of UStags. The DNA-predicted database protein sequences were then compared to the UStags, and the differences observed across or in the UStags (i.e., the UStags' prefix and suffix sequences and the UStags themselves) were used to infer possible sequence modifications. With this de novo-UStag approach, we uncovered some unexpected variances within several yeast protein sequences due to amino acid mutations and/or multiple modifications to the predicted protein sequences. To determine false discovery rates, two random (false) databases were independently used for sequence matching, and ~3% false discovery rates were estimated for the de novo-UStag approach. The factors affecting the reliability (e.g., existence of de novo sequencing noise residues and redundant sequences) and the sensitivity of the approach were investigated and described. The combined de novo-UStag approach complements the UStag method previously reported by enabling the discovery of new protein modifications.",

Based on a simple computational model, this study describes a high-throughput percentage-of-binding strategy to measure the binding energy in DNA-protein interactions between the Shewanella oneidensis ArcA two-component transcription factor protein and a systematic set of mutants in an ArcA-P (phosphorylated ArcA) binding site. The binding energies corresponding to each of the 4 nt at each position in the 15-bp binding site were used to construct a position-specific energy matrix (PEM) that allowed a reliable prediction of ArcA-P binding sites not only in Shewanella but also in related bacterial genomes.",

Here, we study the protein degradation in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells on a proteome-wide scale by detection of the intermediate peptides produced from the intracellular degradation of proteins using sequencing-based tandem mass spectrometry. By tracing the detected approximately 1100 peptides and their approximately 200 protein-substrate origins we obtain evidence for new insights into the proteome-wide protein-selective degradation in yeast cells. This evidence shows that the yeast cytoplasm is the largest pool for the degradation of proteins with both biochemical and geometric specificities, whereas the yeast nucleus seems to be a proteolysis-inert organelle under the condition studied. Yeast V-ATPase subunits appear to be degraded during their disassembly, and yeast mitochondrial proteins functioning as precursors, transport carriers, and gates are preferentially degraded. Ubiquitylation may be unnecessary for the proteasomal degradation of yeast cytoplasmic regulatory and enzyme proteins according to our observations. This study shows that the intracellular peptides are informational targets for directly probing the protein degradation-involved molecular mechanisms and cell biology processes.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying proteins and their modification states and with known levels of confidence remains as a significant challenge for proteomics. Random or decoy peptide databases are increasingly being used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR), e.g., from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses of tryptic digests. We show that this approach can significantly underestimate the FDR and describe an approach for more confident protein identifications that uses unique partial sequences derived from a combination of database searching and amino acid residue sequencing using high-accuracy MS/MS data. Applied to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae tryptic digest, the approach provided 3 132 confident peptide identifications ( approximately 5% modified in some fashion), covering 575 proteins with an estimated zero FDR. The conventional approach provided 3 359 peptide identifications and 656 proteins with 0.3% FDR based upon a decoy database analysis. However, the present approach revealed approximately 5% of the 3 359 identifications to be incorrect and many more as potentially ambiguous (e.g., due to not considering certain amino acid substitutions and modifications). In addition, 677 peptides and 39 proteins were identified that had been missed by conventional analysis, including nontryptic peptides, peptides with a variety of expected/unexpected chemical modifications, known/unknown post-translational modifications, single nucleotide polymorphisms or gene encoding errors, and multiple modifications of individual peptides.",

Observed peptide elution time shifts for a single phosphorylation ranged from -5.28 min (for pYVPML) to +0.59 min (for HRDpSGLLDSLGR). Peptides containing a phosphotyrosine residue displayed a significant decrease in elution time following phosphorylation compared to their similar-sized peptides with phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues. While peptide phosphorylation generally led to a decrease in the observed elution time, five peptides displayed increased elution times as a result of phosphorylation. For large peptides (> or =18 amino acids), the elution time shifts due to single phosphorylation were limited (ranging between -0.48 and +0.03 min), while the elution time shifts for small peptides (<18 amino acids) were characterized by a larger deviation (ranging between -5.28 and +0.59 min). The predictive capability for the observed RPLC elution time change due to phosphorylation has been suggested, which will aid in assigning confident phosphopeptide identifications and their subsequent confirmation.",

        "Abstract": "Sea urchins have proved fascinating to biologists since the time of Aristotle who compared the appearance of their bony mouth structure to a lantern in The History of Animals. Throughout modern times it has been a model system for research in developmental biology. Now, the genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus is the first echinoderm genome to be sequenced. A high quality draft sequence assembly was produced using the Atlas assembler to combine whole genome shotgun sequences with sequences from a collection of BACs selected to form a minimal tiling path along the genome. A formidable challenge was presented by the high degree of heterozygosity between the two haplotypes of the selected male representative of this marine organism. This was overcome by use of the BAC tiling path backbone, in which each BAC represents a single haplotype, as well as by improvements in the Atlas software. Another innovation introduced in this project was the sequencing of pools of tiling path BACs rather than individual BAC sequencing. The Clone-Array Pooled Shotgun Strategy greatly reduced the cost and time devoted to preparing shotgun libraries from BAC clones. The genome sequence was analyzed with several gene prediction methods to produce a comprehensive gene list that was then manually refined and annotated by a volunteer team of sea urchin experts. This latter annotation community edited over 9000 gene models and uncovered many unexpected aspects of the sea urchin genetic content impacting transcriptional regulation, immunology, sensory perception, and an organism's development. Analysis of the basic deuterostome genetic complement supports the sea urchin's role as a model system for deuterostome and, by extension, chordate development.",

        "Title": "Making broad proteome protein measurements in 1-5 min using high-speed RPLC separations and high-accuracy mass measurements.",
        "Abstract": "The throughput of proteomics measurements that provide broad protein coverage is limited by the quality and speed of both the separations as well as the subsequent mass spectrometric analysis; at present, analysis times can range anywhere from hours (high throughput) to days or longer (low throughput). We have explored the basis for proteomics analyses conducted on the order of minutes using high-speed capillary RPLC combined through on-line electrospray ionization interface with high-accuracy mass spectrometry (MS) measurements. Short 0.8-microm porous C18 particle-packed 50-microm-i.d. capillaries were used to speed the RPLC separations while still providing high-quality separations. Both time-of-flight (TOF) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS were applied for identifying peptides using the accurate mass and time (AMT) tag approach. Peptide RPLC relative retention (elution) times that were generated by solvent gradients that differed by at least 25-fold were found to provide relative elution times that agreed to within 5%, which provides the basis for using peptide AMT tags for higher throughput proteomics measurements. For fast MS acquisition speeds (e.g., 0.2 s for TOF and either approximately 0.3 or approximately 0.6 s for FTICR), peptide mass measurement accuracies of better than +/-15 ppm were obtained with the high-speed RPLC separations. The ability to identify peptides and the overall proteome coverage was determined by factors that include the separation peak capacity, the sensitivity of the MS (with fast scanning), and the accuracy of both the mass measurements and the relative RPLC peptide elution times. The experimental RPLC relative elution time accuracies of 5% (using high-speed capillary RPLC) and mass measurement accuracies of better than +/-15 ppm allowed for the confident identification of >2800 peptides and >760 proteins from >13,000 different putative peptides detected from a Shewanellaoneidensis tryptic digest. Initial results for both RPLC-ESI-TOF and RPLC-ESI-FTICR MS were similar, with approximately 2000 different peptides from approximately 600 different proteins identified within 2-3 min. For <120-s proteomic analysis, TOF MS analyses were more effective, while FTICR MS was more effective for the >150-s analysis due to the improved mass accuracies attained using longer spectrum acquisition times.",

        "Abstract": "We describe approaches for proteomics analysis using electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry coupled with fast reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) separations. The RPLC separations used 50-microm-i.d. fused-silica capillaries packed with submicrometer-sized C18-bonded porous silica particles and achieved peak capacities of 130-420 for analytes from proteome tryptic digests. When these separations were combined with linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry measurements, approximately 1000 proteins could be identified in 50 min from approximately 4000 identified tryptic peptides; approximately 550 proteins in 20 min from approximately 1800 peptides; and approximately 250 proteins in 8 min from approximately 700 peptides for a S. oneidensis tryptic digest. The dynamic range for protein identification with the fast separations was determined to be approximately 3-4 orders of magnitude of relative protein abundance on the basis of known proteins in human blood plasma analyses. We found that 55% of the MS/MS spectra acquired during the entire analysis (and up to 100% of the MS/MS spectra acquired from the most data-rich zone) provided sufficient quality for identifying peptides. The results confirm that such analyses using very fast (minutes) RPLC separations based on columns packed with microsized porous particles are primarily limited by the MS/MS analysis speed.",

        "Abstract": "We describe methods for broad characterization of the human plasma proteome. The combination of stepwise immunoglobulin G (IgG) and albumin protein depletion by affinity chromatography and ultrahigh-efficiency capillary liquid chromatography separations coupled to ion trap-tandem mass spectrometry enabled identification of 2392 proteins from a single plasma sample with an estimated confidence level of > 94%, and an additional 2198 proteins with an estimated confidence level of 80%. The relative abundances of the identified proteins span a range of over eight orders of magnitude in concentration (< 30 pg/mL to approximately 30 mg/mL), facilitated by the attomole-level sensitivity of the analysis methods. More than 80% of the observed proteins demonstrate interactions with IgG and/or albumin, and the human plasma protein loss in the affinity chromatography/strong cation exchange/reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methodology was investigated in detail. The results of this study provide a basis for a wide range of plasma proteomics studies, including broad quantitation of relative abundances in comparative studies of the identification of novel protein disease markers, as well as further studies of protein-protein interactions.",

The monolithic columns at a mobile-phase pressure of 5000 psi provide flow rates of approximately 40 nL/min at a linear velocity of approximately 0.24 cm/s. The columns provide a separation peak capacity of approximately 420 in conjunction with both on-line coupling with microsolid-phase extraction and nanoelectrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Performance was evaluated using a Shewanella oneidensis tryptic digest, and approximately 15-amol detection limits for peptides were obtained using a conventional ion trap and MS/MS for peptide identification. The sensitivity and separation efficiency enabled the identification of 2367 different peptides covering 855 distinct S. oneidensis proteins from a 2.5-microg tryptic digest sample in a single 10-h analysis. The number of identified peptides and proteins approximately doubled when the effective separation time was extended from 200 to 600 min. The number of identified peptides increased from 32 to 390 as the injection amount was increased from 0.5 to 100 ng. Both the run-to-run and column-to-column reproducibility for proteomic analyses were also evaluated.",

        "Abstract": "Recent developments in combined separations with mass spectrometry for sensitive and high-throughput proteomic analyses are reviewed herein. These developments primarily involve high-efficiency (separation peak capacities of approximately 10(3)) nanoscale liquid chromatography (flow rates extending down to approximately 20 nl/min at optimal liquid mobile-phase separation linear velocities through narrow packed capillaries) in combination with advanced mass spectrometry and in particular, high-sensitivity and high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Such approaches enable analysis of low nanogram level proteomic samples (i.e., nanoscale proteomics) with individual protein identification sensitivity at the low zeptomole level. The resultant protein measurement dynamic range can approach 10(6) for nanogram-sized proteomic samples, while more abundant proteins can be detected from subpicogram-sized (total) proteome samples. These qualities provide the foundation for proteomics studies of single or small populations of cells. The instrumental robustness required for automation and providing high-quality routine performance nanoscale proteomic analyses is also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Proteomics analysis based-on reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is widely practiced; however, variations providing cutting-edge RPLC performance have generally not been adopted even though their benefits are well established. Here, we describe an automated format 20 kpsi RPLC system for proteomics and metabolomics that includes on-line coupling of micro-solid phase extraction for sample loading and allows electrospray ionization emitters to be readily replaced. The system uses 50 microm i.d. x 40-200 cm fused-silica capillaries packed with 1.4-3-microm porous C18-bonded silica particles to obtain chromatographic peak capacities of 1000-1500 for complex peptide and metabolite mixtures. This separation quality provided high-confidence identifications of >12 000 different tryptic peptides from >2000 distinct Shewanella oneidensis proteins (approximately 40% of the proteins predicted for the S. oneidensis proteome) in a single 12-h ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. The protein identification reproducibility approached 90% between replicate experiments. The average protein MS/MS identification rate exceeded 10 proteins/min, and 1207 proteins were identified in 120 min through assignment of 5944 different peptides. The proteomic analysis dynamic range of the 20 kpsi RPLC-ion trap MS/MS was approximately 10(6) based on analyses of a human blood plasma sample, for which 835 distinct proteins were identified with high confidence in a single 12-h run. A single run of the 20 kpsi RPLC-accurate mass MS detected >5000 different compounds from a metabolomics sample.",

Using conservative SEQUEST peptide identification criteria (i.e., without considering chymotryptic or elastic peptides) and peptide LC normalized elution time constraints, the separation quality enabled the identification of proteins over a dynamic range of greater than 8 orders of magnitude in relative abundance using ion trap MS/MS instrumentation. Between 800 and 1682 human proteins were identified, depending on the criteria used for identification, from a total of 365 microg of human plasma.

        "Abstract": "Ultrasensitive nanoscale proteomics approaches for characterizing proteins from complex proteomic samples of <50 ng of total mass are described. Protein identifications from 0.5 pg of whole proteome extracts were enabled by ultrahigh sensitivity (<75 zmol for individual proteins) achieved using high-efficiency (peak capacities of approximately 10(3)) 15-microm-i.d. capillary liquid chromatography separations (i.e., using nanoLC, approximately 20 nL/min mobile-phase flow rate at the optimal linear velocity of approximately 0.2 cm/s) coupled on-line with a micro-solid-phase sample extraction and a nanoscale electrospray ionization interface to a 11.4-T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer (MS). Proteome measurement coverage improved as sample size was increased from as little as 0.5 pg of sample. It was found that a 2.5-ng sample provided 14% coverage of all annotated open reading frames for the microorganism Deinococcus radiodurans, consistent with previous results for a specific culture condition. The estimated detection dynamic range for detected proteins was 10(5)-10(6). An improved accurate mass and LC elution time two-dimensional data analysis methodology, used to both speed and increase the confidence of peptide/protein identifications, enabled identification of 872 proteins/run from a single 3-h nanoLC/FTICR MS analysis. The low-zeptomole-level sensitivity provides a basis for extending proteomics studies to smaller cell populations and potentially to a single mammalian cell. Application with ion trap MS/MS instrumentation allowed protein identification from 50 pg (total mass) of proteomic samples (i.e., approximately 100 times larger than FTICR MS), corresponding to a sensitivity of approximately 7 amol for individual proteins. Compared with single-stage FTICR measurements, ion trap MS/MS provided a much lower proteome measurement coverage and dynamic range for a given analysis time and sample quantity.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to manipulate and effectively utilize small proteomic samples is important for analyses using liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) and becomes more challenging for very low flow rates due to extra column volume effects on separation quality. Here we report on the use of commercial switching valves (150-microm channels) for implementing the on-line coupling of capillary LC columns operated at 10,000 psi with relatively large solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns. With the use of optimized column connections, switching modes, and SPE column dimensions, high-efficiency on-line SPE-capillary and nanoscale LC separations were obtained demonstrating peak capacities of approximately 1000 for capillaries having inner diameters between 15 and 150 microm. The on-line coupled SPE columns increased the sample processing capacity by approximately 400-fold for sample solution volume and approximately 10-fold for sample mass. The proteomic applications of this on-line SPE-capillary LC system were evaluated for analysis of both soluble and membrane protein tryptic digests. Using an ion trap tandem MS it was typically feasible to identify 1100-1500 unique peptides in a 5-h analysis. Peptides extracted from the SPE column and then eluted from the LC column covered a hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity range that included an estimated approximately 98% of all tryptic peptides. The SPE-capillary LC implementation also facilitates automation and enables use of both disposable SPE columns and electrospray emitters, providing a robust basis for automated proteomic analyses.",

        "Abstract": "On-line combination of capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) with capillary reversed-phase liquid chromatography (CRPLC) is developed using a microinjector as the interface for performing two-dimensional (2-D) protein/peptide separations of complex protein mixtures. The focusing effect of CIEF not only contributes to a high-resolution protein/peptide separation, but also may permit the analysis of low-abundance proteins with a typical concentration factor of 50-100 times. The preparative capabilities of CIEF are much larger than most of capillary-based electrokinetic separation techniques since the entire capillary is initially filled with a solution containing proteins/peptides and carrier ampholytes for the creation of a pH gradient inside the capillary. The focused peptides which have a similar pI are coinjected into the second separation dimension and further resolved by their differences in hydrophobicity. The resolving power of combined CIEF-CRPLC system is demonstrated using the soluble fraction of Drosophila salivary glands taken from a period beginning before steroid-triggered programmed cell death and extending to its completion. The separation mechanisms of CIEF and CRPLC are completely orthogonal and the overall peak capacity is estimated to be around approximately 1800 over a run time of less than 8 h. Significant enhancement in the separation peak capacity can be realized by further increasing the number of CIEF fractions and/or slowing the solvent gradient in CRPLC, however, at the expense of overall analysis time. The results of our preliminary studies display significant differences in the separation profiles of peptide samples obtained from salivary glands of animals staged at the 6 and 12 h following puparium formation.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying and quantifying in a high throughput manner the proteins expressed by cells, tissues or an organism provides the basis for understanding the functions of its constituents at a \"systems\" level. As a result, proteome analysis has increasingly become the focus of significant interest and research over the past decade. This is especially true following the recent stunning achievements in genomics analyses. However, unlike the static genome, the complexities and dynamism of the proteome present significant analytical challenges and demand highly efficient separations and detection technologies. A number of recent technological advancements have been in direct response to these challenges. Currently, strategically mated combinations of sophisticated separations techniques and advanced mass spectrometric detection represent the best approach to addressing the intricacies of the proteome. Liquid-phase separations, often within capillaries, are increasingly recognized as the best separations technique for this approach. In combination on-line with mass spectrometry, liquid-phase separations provide the improved analytical sensitivity, sample throughput, and quantitation capabilities necessitated by the multifaceted problems within proteomics analyses. This review focuses primarily on current high-efficiency capillary separations techniques, including both capillary liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis, applied to the analysis of complex proteomic samples. We emphasize developments at our laboratory and illustrate technical advances that attempt to review the role of separations within the broader context of a state-of-the-art integrated proteomics effort.",

        "Title": "High-efficiency nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled on-line with mass spectrometry using nanoelectrospray ionization for proteomics.",
        "Abstract": "We describe high-efficiency (peak capacities of approximately 10(3)) nanoscale (using column inner diameters down to 15 microm) liquid chromatography (nanoLC)/low flow rate electrospray (nanoESI) mass spectrometry (MS) for the sensitive analysis of complex global cellular protein enzymatic digests (i.e., proteomics). Using a liquid slurry packing method with carefully selected packing solvents, 87-cm-length capillaries having inner diameters of 14.9-74.5 microm were successfully packed with 3-microm C18-bonded porous (300-A pores) silica particles at a pressure of 18,000 psi. With a mobile-phase delivery pressure of 10,000 psi, these packed capillaries provided mobile-phase flow rates as low as approximately 20 nL/min at LC linear velocities of approximately 0.2 cm/s, which is near optimal for separation efficiency. To maintain chromatographic efficiency, unions with internal channel diameters as small as 10 microm were specially produced for connecting packed capillaries to replaceable nanoESI emitters having orifice diameters of 2-10 microm (depending on the packed capillary dimensions). Coupled on-line with a hybrid-quadrupole time-of-flight MS through the nanoESI interface, the nanoLC separations provided peak capacities of approximately 10(3) for proteome proteolytic polypeptide mixtures when a positive feedback switching valve was used for quantitatively introducing samples. Over a relatively large range of sample loadings (e.g., 5-100 ng, and 50-500 ng of cellular proteolytic peptides for 14.9- and 29.7-microm-i.d. packed capillaries, respectively), the nanoLC/nanoESI MS response for low-abundance components of the complex mixtures was found to increase linearly with sample loading. The nanoLC/nanoESI-MS sensitivity also increased linearly with decreasing flow rate (or approximately inversely proportional to the square of the capillary inner diameter) in the flow range of 20-400 nL/min. Thus, except at the lower loadings, decreasing the separation capillary inner diameter has an effect equivalent to increasing sample loading, which is important for sample-limited proteomic applications. No significant effects on recovery of eluting polypeptides were observed using porous C18 particles with surface pores of 300-A versus nonporous particles. Tandem MS analyses were also demonstrated using the high-efficiency nanoLC separations. Chromatographic elution time, MS response intensity, and mass measurement accuracy was examined between runs with a single column (with a single nanoESI emitter), between different columns (same and different inner diameters with different nanoESI emitters), and for different samples (various concentrations of cellular proteolytic peptides) and demonstrated robust and reproducible sensitive analyses for complex proteomic samples.",

        "Abstract": "The pathway of the gating conformational transition of Escherichia coli mechanosensitive channel was simulated, using the recently modeled open and closed structures, by targeted molecular dynamics method. The transition can be roughly viewed as a four-stage process. The initial motion under a lower tension load is predominantly elastic deformation. The opening of the inner hydrophobic pore on a higher tension load takes place after the major expansion of the outer channel dimension. The hypothetical N-terminal S1 helical bundle has been confirmed to form the hydrophobic gate, together with the M1 helices. The sequential breaking of the tandem hydrophobic constrictions on the M1 and S1 helices makes the two parts of the gate strictly coupled, acting as a single gate. The simulation also revealed that there is no significant energetic coupling between the inner S1 bundle and the outer M2 transmembrane helices. The molten-globular-like structural features of the S1 bundle in its intermediate open states may account for the observed multiple subconductance states. Moreover, the intermediate open states of mechanosensitive channels are not symmetric, i.e., the opening does not follow iris-like motion, which sharply contrasts to the potassium channel KcsA.",

        "Abstract": "The gating mechanism of the potassium channel KcsA was studied by normal mode analysis. The results provided an atomic description of the locations of the pivot points and the motional features of key structural elements in the gating process. Two pivot points were found in the motions of the inner TM2 helical bundle that directly modulate the size of the central channel pore. One point is an intrasubunit hinge point that sharply divides the structural flexibility between the more rigid selectivity filter and the more mobile peripheral transmembrane helices. Such a division is vital for KcsA because it permits the large-scale motions of transmembrane helices required for the gating and, in the meantime, maintains the rigidity of the filter region essential for the selectivity. The other pivot point is an intersubunit one at which all four TM2 helices are bundled together. During the gating process, each TM2 helix undergoes a lever-like swinging motion pivoting on the intrasubunit hinge, and the entire TM2 bundle undergoes a concerted rotational motion around the central channel axis constrained around the intersubunit bundle point. This series of motions leads to a dramatic enlargement of the intracellular gate without loosening up the structural integrity.",
