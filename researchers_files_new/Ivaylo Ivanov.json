Whereas translation of uORFs generally represses translation of the mORFs, a subset of uORFs serves as a nexus for regulating translation of the mORF. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms by which uORFs can repress or stimulate mRNA translation, highlight uORF-mediated translational repression involving ribosome queuing, and critically evaluate recently described alternatives to the delayed reinitiation model for uORF-mediated regulation of the ",

Since inflammation and oxidative stress are recognized as triggering factors for cancer, anti-cancer activity has also been documented and the possible mechanisms of this activity are under investigation. Important components of C. coggygria extracts are shown to be hydrolysable gallotannins of which pentagalloyl-O-glucose has been studied in details. This compound inhibits various enzymes including prolyl oligopeptidase which is involved in tumorigenesis and tumour growth. According to our pilot studies, oligo-O-galloylglucoses with more than five galloyl residues are also presented in the herb of Bulgarian origin, but their activities have not been examined.",

        "Abstract": "Diphthamide (DPH), a conserved amino acid modification on eukaryotic translation elongation factor eEF2, is synthesized via a complex, multi-enzyme pathway. While DPH is non-essential for cell viability and its function has not been resolved, diphtheria and other bacterial toxins ADP-ribosylate DPH to inhibit translation. Characterizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants that lack DPH or show synthetic growth defects in the absence of DPH, we show that loss of DPH increases resistance to the fungal translation inhibitor sordarin and increases -1 ribosomal frameshifting at non-programmed sites during normal translation elongation and at viral programmed frameshifting sites. Ribosome profiling of yeast and mammalian cells lacking DPH reveals increased ribosomal drop-off during elongation, and removal of out-of-frame stop codons restores ribosomal processivity on the ultralong yeast MDN1 mRNA. Finally, we show that ADP-ribosylation of DPH impairs the productive binding of eEF2 to elongating ribosomes. Our results reveal that loss of DPH impairs the fidelity of translocation during translation elongation resulting in increased rates of ribosomal frameshifting throughout elongation and leading to premature termination at out-of-frame stop codons. We propose that the costly, yet non-essential, DPH modification has been conserved through evolution to maintain translational fidelity despite being a target for inactivation by bacterial toxins.",

        "Abstract": "Transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is a protein assembly essential for transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER). Yet, understanding of the conformational switching underpinning these diverse TFIIH functions remains fragmentary. TFIIH mechanisms critically depend on two translocase subunits, XPB and XPD. To unravel their functions and regulation, we build cryo-EM based TFIIH models in transcription- and NER-competent states. Using simulations and graph-theoretical analysis methods, we reveal TFIIH's global motions, define TFIIH partitioning into dynamic communities and show how TFIIH reshapes itself and self-regulates depending on functional context. Our study uncovers an internal regulatory mechanism that switches XPB and XPD activities making them mutually exclusive between NER and transcription initiation.

        "Abstract": "How intestinal microbes regulate metabolic syndrome is incompletely understood. We show that intestinal microbiota protects against development of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and pre-diabetic phenotypes by inducing commensal-specific Th17 cells. High-fat, high-sugar diet promoted metabolic disease by depleting Th17-inducing microbes, and recovery of commensal Th17 cells restored protection. Microbiota-induced Th17 cells afforded protection by regulating lipid absorption across intestinal epithelium in an IL-17-dependent manner. Diet-induced loss of protective Th17 cells was mediated by the presence of sugar. Eliminating sugar from high-fat diets protected mice from obesity and metabolic syndrome in a manner dependent on commensal-specific Th17 cells. Sugar and ILC3 promoted outgrowth of Faecalibaculum rodentium that displaced Th17-inducing microbiota. These results define dietary and microbiota factors posing risk for metabolic syndrome. They also define a microbiota-dependent mechanism for immuno-pathogenicity of dietary sugar and highlight an elaborate interaction between diet, microbiota, and intestinal immunity in regulation of metabolic disorders.",

        "Abstract": "The immune system employs recognition tools to communicate with its microbial evolutionary partner. Among all the methods of microbial perception, T cells enable the widest spectrum of microbial recognition resolution, ranging from the crudest detection of whole groups of microbes to the finest detection of specific antigens. The application of this recognition capability to the crucial task of combatting infections has been the focus of classical immunology. We now appreciate that the coevolution of the immune system and the microbiota has led to development of a lush immunological decision tree downstream of microbial recognition, of which an inflammatory response is but one branch. In this review we discuss known T cell-microbe interactions in the gut and place them in the context of an algorithmic framework of recognition, context-dependent interpretation, and response circuits across multiple levels of microbial recognition resolution. The malleability of T cells in response to the microbiota presents an opportunity to edit immune response cellularity, identity, and functionality by utilizing microbiota-controlled pathways to promote human health.",

        "Abstract": "Transcription-coupled repair is essential for the removal of DNA lesions from the transcribed genome. The pathway is initiated by CSB protein binding to stalled RNA polymerase II. Mutations impairing CSB function cause severe genetic disease. Yet, the ATP-dependent mechanism by which CSB powers RNA polymerase to bypass certain lesions while triggering excision of others is incompletely understood. Here we build structural models of RNA polymerase II bound to the yeast CSB ortholog Rad26 in nucleotide-free and bound states. This enables simulations and graph-theoretical analyses to define partitioning of this complex into dynamic communities and delineate how its structural elements function together to remodel DNA. We identify an allosteric pathway coupling motions of the Rad26 ATPase modules to changes in RNA polymerase and DNA to unveil a structural mechanism for CSB-assisted progression past less bulky lesions. Our models allow functional interpretation of the effects of Cockayne syndrome disease mutations.",

        "Abstract": "Proofreading by replicative DNA polymerases is a fundamental mechanism ensuring DNA replication fidelity. In proofreading, mis-incorporated nucleotides are excised through the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme. The exonuclease site is distal from the polymerization site, imposing stringent structural and kinetic requirements for efficient primer strand transfer. Yet, the molecular mechanism of this transfer is not known. Here we employ molecular simulations using recent cryo-EM structures and biochemical analyses to delineate an optimal free energy path connecting the polymerization and exonuclease states of E. coli replicative DNA polymerase Pol III. We identify structures for all intermediates, in which the transitioning primer strand is stabilized by conserved Pol III residues along the fingers, thumb and exonuclease domains. We demonstrate switching kinetics on a tens of milliseconds timescale and unveil a complete pol-to-exo switching mechanism, validated by targeted mutational experiments.",

        "Abstract": "Cells utilize transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms to alter gene expression in response to environmental cues. Gene-specific controls, including changing the translation of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), provide a rapid means to respond precisely to different conditions. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are known to control the translation of mRNAs. Recent studies in bacteria and eukaryotes have revealed the functions of evolutionarily conserved uORF-encoded peptides. Some of these uORF-encoded nascent peptides enable responses to specific metabolites to modulate the translation of their mRNAs by stalling ribosomes and through ribosome stalling may also modulate the level of their mRNAs. In this review, we highlight several examples of conserved uORF nascent peptides that stall ribosomes to regulate gene expression in response to specific metabolites in bacteria, fungi, mammals, and plants.",

In this review, we first provide a broad overview of modeling methods used for flexible fitting of molecular models into cryo-EM density maps. We give special attention to approaches rooted in molecular simulations-atomistic molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo. Concise descriptions of the methods are given along with discussion of their advantages, limitations, and most popular alternatives. We also describe recent extensions of the widely used molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) method and discuss how different model-building techniques could be incorporated into new hybrid modeling schemes and simulation workflows. Finally, we provide two illustrative examples of model-building and refinement strategies employing MDFF, cascade MDFF, and RosettaCM. These examples come from recent cryo-EM studies that elucidated transcription preinitiation complexes and shed light on the functional roles of these assemblies in gene expression and gene regulation.",

Cryo-EM advances have begun to uncover their structural organization. Nevertheless, functional analyses are hindered by incompletely modeled regions. Here we integrate all available cryo-EM data to build a practically complete human PIC structural model. This enables simulations that reveal the assembly's global motions, define PIC partitioning into dynamic communities and delineate how structural modules function together to remodel DNA. We identify key TFIIE-p62 interactions that link core-PIC to TFIIH. p62 rigging interlaces p34, p44 and XPD while capping the DNA-binding and ATP-binding sites of XPD. PIC kinks and locks substrate DNA, creating negative supercoiling within the Pol II cleft to facilitate promoter opening. Mapping disease mutations associated with xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy and Cockayne syndrome onto defined communities reveals clustering into three mechanistic classes that affect TFIIH helicase functions, protein interactions and interface dynamics.",

        "Abstract": "Regulation of gene-expression by specific targeting of protein-nucleic acid interactions has been a long-standing goal in medicinal chemistry. Transcription factors are considered \"undruggable\" because they lack binding sites well suited for binding small-molecules. In order to overcome this obstacle, we are interested in designing small molecules that bind to the corresponding promoter sequences and either prevent or modulate transcription factor association via an allosteric mechanism. To achieve this, we must design small molecules that are both sequence-specific and able to target G/C base pair sites. A thorough understanding of the relationship between binding affinity and the structural aspects of the small molecule-DNA complex would greatly aid in rational design of such compounds. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of sequence-specific DNA association of a synthetic minor groove binder using long timescale molecular dynamics. We show how binding selectivity arises from a combination of structural factors. Our results provide a framework for the rational design and optimization of synthetic small molecules in order to improve site-specific targeting of DNA for therapeutic uses in the design of selective DNA binders targeting transcription regulation.",

Within cells, polyamines contribute to both the efficiency and fidelity of protein synthesis. In addition to directly acting on the translation apparatus to stimulate protein synthesis, the polyamine spermidine serves as a precursor for the essential post-translational modification of the eukaryotic translation factor 5A (eIF5A), which is required for synthesis of proteins containing problematic amino acid sequence motifs, including polyproline tracts, and for termination of translation. The impact of polyamines on translation is highlighted by autoregulation of the translation of mRNAs encoding key metabolic and regulatory proteins in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, including ",

        "Abstract": "Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a pivotal enzyme with dual roles in both genome maintenance and epigenetic regulation. TDG is involved in cytosine demethylation at CpG sites in DNA. Here we have used molecular modeling to delineate the lesion search and DNA base interrogation mechanisms of TDG. First, we examined the capacity of TDG to interrogate not only DNA substrates with 5-carboxyl cytosine modifications but also G:T mismatches and nonmismatched (A:T) base pairs using classical and accelerated molecular dynamics. To determine the kinetics, we constructed Markov state models. Base interrogation was found to be highly stochastic and proceeded through insertion of an arginine-containing loop into the DNA minor groove to transiently disrupt Watson-Crick pairing. Next, we employed chain-of-replicas path-sampling methodologies to compute minimum free energy paths for TDG base extrusion. We identified the key intermediates imparting selectivity and determined effective free energy profiles for the lesion search and base extrusion into the TDG active site. Our results show that DNA sculpting, dynamic glycosylase interactions, and stabilizing contacts collectively provide a powerful mechanism for the detection and discrimination of modified bases and epigenetic marks in DNA.",

        "Abstract": "Translation initiation is typically restricted to AUG codons, and scanning eukaryotic ribosomes inefficiently recognize near-cognate codons. We show that queuing of scanning ribosomes behind a paused elongating ribosome promotes initiation at upstream weak start sites. Ribosomal profiling reveals polyamine-dependent pausing of elongating ribosomes on a conserved Pro-Pro-Trp (PPW) motif in an inhibitory non-AUG-initiated upstream conserved coding region (uCC) of the antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) mRNA, encoding a regulator of cellular polyamine synthesis. Mutation of the PPW motif impairs initiation at the uCC's upstream near-cognate AUU start site and derepresses AZIN1 synthesis, whereas substitution of alternate elongation pause sequences restores uCC translation. Impairing ribosome loading reduces uCC translation and paradoxically derepresses AZIN1 synthesis. Finally, we identify the translation factor eIF5A as a sensor and effector for polyamine control of uCC translation. We propose that stalling of elongating ribosomes triggers queuing of scanning ribosomes and promotes initiation by positioning a ribosome near the start codon.",

        "Abstract": "The efficiency of start codon selection during ribosomal scanning in eukaryotic translation initiation is influenced by the context or flanking nucleotides surrounding the AUG codon. The levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factors 1 (eIF1) and 5 (eIF5) play critical roles in controlling the stringency of translation start site selection. The basic leucine zipper and W2 domain-containing proteins 1 and 2 (BZW1 and BZW2), also known as eIF5-mimic proteins, are paralogous human proteins containing C-terminal HEAT domains that resemble the HEAT domain of eIF5. We show that translation of mRNAs encoding BZW1 and BZW2 homologs in fungi, plants and metazoans is initiated by AUG codons in conserved unfavorable initiation contexts. This conservation is reminiscent of the conserved unfavorable initiation context that enables autoregulation of EIF1. We show that overexpression of BZW1 and BZW2 proteins enhances the stringency of start site selection, and that their poor initiation codons confer autoregulation on BZW1 and BZW2 mRNA translation. We also show that overexpression of these two proteins significantly diminishes the effect of overexpressing eIF5 on stringency of start codon selection, suggesting they antagonize this function of eIF5. These results reveal a surprising role for BZW1 and BZW2 in maintaining homeostatic stringency of start codon selection, and taking into account recent biochemical, genetic and structural insights into eukaryotic initiation, suggest a model for BZW1 and BZW2 function.",

However, effective and practical methods for analyzing this emerging class of markers are lacking. Analysis of ctNAs using a sensor-based approach has notable challenges, as it is vital to differentiate nucleic acids from normal cells from mutation-bearing sequences emerging from tumours. Moreover, many genes related to cancer have dozens of different mutations. Herein, we report an electrochemical approach that directly detects genes with mutations in patient serum by using combinatorial probes (CPs). The CPs enable detection of all of the mutant alleles derived from the same part of the gene. As a proof of concept, we analyze mutations of the EGFR gene, which has more than 40 clinically relevant alterations that include deletions, insertions, and point mutations. Our CP-based approach accurately detects mutant sequences directly in patient serum.",

        "Abstract": "Specific targeting of protein–nucleic acid interactions is an area of current interest, for example, in the regulation of gene-expression. Most transcription factor proteins bind in the DNA major groove; however, we are interested in an approach using small molecules to target the minor groove to control expression by an allosteric mechanism. In an effort to broaden sequence recognition of DNA-targeted-small-molecules to include both A·T and G·C base pairs, we recently discovered that the heterocyclic diamidine, DB2277, forms a strong monomer complex with a DNA sequence containing 5΄-AAAGTTT-3΄. Competition mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance identified new monomer complexes, as well as unexpected binding of two DB2277 with certain sequences. Inherent microstructural differences within the experimental DNAs were identified through computational analyses to understand the molecular basis for recognition. These findings emphasize the critical nature of the DNA minor groove microstructure for sequence-specific recognition and offer new avenues to design synthetic small molecules for effective regulation of gene-expression.",

        "Abstract": "Progress toward the development of minimally invasive liquid biopsies of disease is being bolstered by breakthroughs in the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA): DNA released from cancer cells into the bloodstream. However, robust, sensitive, and specific methods of detecting this emerging analyte are lacking. ctDNA analysis has unique challenges, since it is imperative to distinguish circulating DNA from normal cells vs mutation-bearing sequences originating from tumors. Here we report the electrochemical detection of mutated ctDNA in samples collected from cancer patients. By developing a strategy relying on the use of DNA clutch probes (DCPs) that render specific sequences of ctDNA accessible, we were able to readout the presence of mutated ctDNA. DCPs prevent reassociation of denatured DNA strands: they make one of the two strands of a dsDNA accessible for hybridization to a probe, and they also deactivate other closely related sequences in solution. DCPs ensure thereby that only mutated sequences associate with chip-based sensors detecting hybridization events. The assay exhibits excellent sensitivity and specificity in the detection of mutated ctDNA: it detects 1 fg/μL of a target mutation in the presence of 100 pg/μL of wild-type DNA, corresponding to detecting mutations at a level of 0.01% relative to wild type. This approach allows accurate analysis of samples collected from lung cancer and melanoma patients. This work represents the first detection of ctDNA without enzymatic amplification.",

We describe various mechanisms controlling ribosome scanning and initiation codon selection by 5' upstream open reading frames, translation initiation factors, and primary and secondary structures of the 5'UTR, including particular sequence motifs. We also discuss translational control via phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, which is implicated in learning and memory, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.",

Recent studies show that tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPPI) activity in fish is altered after a hypoxic stress pointing out at a possible enzyme involvement in response to hypoxia. Similar studies are not performed in mammals. In this work, the effect of sodium nitrite-induced acute hypoxic shock on the rat brain was studied at different post-treatment periods. Morphological changes in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, thalamus, mesencephalon and pons were assessed using silver-copper impregnation for neurodegeneration. TPPI activity was biochemically assayed and localized by enzyme histochemistry. Although less vulnerable to oxidative stress, the studied brain areas showed different histopathological changes, such as neuronal loss and tissue vacuolization, dilatation of the smallest capillaries and impairment of neuronal processes. TPPI activity was strictly regulated following the hypoxic stress. It was found to increase 12-24h post-treatment, then decreased followed by a slow process of recovery. The enzyme histochemistry revealed a temporary enzyme deficiency in all types of neurons. These findings indicate a possible involvement of the enzyme in rat brain response to hypoxic stress.",

        "Abstract": "Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) processes protein/DNA adducts resulting from abortive DNA topoisomerase II (Top2) activity. TDP2 inhibition could provide synergism with the Top2 poison class of chemotherapeutics. By virtual screening of the NCI diversity small molecule database, we identified selective TDP2 inhibitors and experimentally verified their selective inhibitory activity. Three inhibitors exhibited low-micromolar IC50 values. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a common binding mode for these inhibitors, involving association to the TDP2 DNA-binding cleft. MM-PBSA per-residue energy decomposition identified important interactions of the compounds with specific TDP2 residues. These interactions could provide new avenues for synthetic optimization of these scaffolds.",

        "Abstract": "Abundant evidence for translation within the 5' leaders of many human genes is rapidly emerging, especially, because of the advent of ribosome profiling. In most cases, it is believed that the act of translation rather than the encoded peptide is important. However, the wealth of available sequencing data in recent years allows phylogenetic detection of sequences within 5' leaders that have emerged under coding constraint and therefore allow for the prediction of functional 5' leader translation. Using this approach, we previously predicted a CUG-initiated, 173 amino acid N-terminal extension to the human tumour suppressor PTEN. Here, a systematic experimental analysis of translation events in the PTEN 5' leader identifies at least two additional non-AUG-initiated PTEN proteoforms that are expressed in most human cell lines tested. The most abundant extended PTEN proteoform initiates at a conserved AUU codon and extends the canonical AUG-initiated PTEN by 146 amino acids. All N-terminally extended PTEN proteoforms tested retain the ability to downregulate the PI3K pathway. We also provide evidence for the translation of two conserved AUG-initiated upstream open reading frames within the PTEN 5' leader that control the ratio of PTEN proteoforms.",

        "Title": "Secondary Interaction Interfaces with PCNA Control Conformational Switching of DNA Polymerase PolB from Polymerization to Editing.",
        "Abstract": "Replicative DNA polymerases (Pols) frequently possess two distinct DNA processing activities: DNA synthesis (polymerization) and proofreading (3'-5' exonuclease activity). The polymerase and exonuclease reactions are performed alternately and are spatially separated in different protein domains. Thus, the growing DNA primer terminus has to undergo dynamic conformational switching between two distinct functional sites on the polymerase. Furthermore, the transition from polymerization (pol) mode to exonuclease (exo) mode must occur in the context of a DNA Pol holoenzyme, wherein the polymerase is physically associated with processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and primer-template DNA. The mechanism of this conformational switching and the role that PCNA plays in it have remained obscure, largely due to the dynamic nature of ternary Pol/PCNA/DNA assemblies. Here, we present computational models of ternary assemblies for archaeal polymerase PolB. We have combined all available structural information for the binary complexes with electron microscopy data and have refined atomistic models for ternary PolB/PCNA/DNA assemblies in pol and exo modes using molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to the canonical PIP-box/interdomain connector loop (IDCL) interface of PolB with PCNA, contact analysis of the simulation trajectories revealed new secondary binding interfaces, distinct between the pol and exo states. Using targeted molecular dynamics, we explored the conformational transition from pol to exo mode. We identified a hinge region between the thumb and palm domains of PolB that is critical for conformational switching. With the thumb domain anchored onto the PCNA surface, the neighboring palm domain executed rotational motion around the hinge, bringing the core of PolB down toward PCNA to form a new interface with the clamp. A helix from PolB containing a patch of arginine residues was involved in the binding, locking the complex in the exo mode conformation. Together, these results provide a structural view of how the transition between the pol and exo states of PolB is coordinated through PCNA to achieve efficient proofreading.",

        "Abstract": "While conventional high-resolution techniques in structural biology are challenged by the size and flexibility of many biological assemblies, recent advances in low-resolution techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) have opened up new avenues to define the structures of such assemblies. By systematically combining various sources of structural, biochemical and biophysical information, integrative modeling approaches aim to provide a unified structural description of such assemblies, starting from high-resolution structures of the individual components and integrating all available information from low-resolution experimental methods. In this review, we describe integrative modeling approaches, which use complementary data from either cryo-EM or SAXS. Specifically, we focus on the popular molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) method, which has been widely used for flexible fitting into cryo-EM maps. Second, we describe hybrid molecular dynamics, Rosetta Monte-Carlo and minimum ensemble search (MES) methods that can be used to incorporate SAXS into pseudoatomic structural models. We present concise descriptions of the two methods and their most popular alternatives, along with select illustrative applications to protein/nucleic acid assemblies involved in DNA replication and repair.",

Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (Mfs) integrate microbial signals and direct adaptive immunity. Although the role of DCs in initiating T cell responses is well appreciated, how Mfs contribute to the generation of CD4 T cell responses to intestinal microbes is unclear. Th17 cells are critical for mucosal immune protection and at steady state are induced by commensal bacteria, such as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB). Here, we examined the roles of mucosal DCs and Mfs in Th17 induction by SFB in vivo. We show that Mfs, and not conventional CD103(+) DCs, are essential for the generation of SFB-specific Th17 responses. Thus, Mfs drive mucosal T cell responses to certain commensal bacteria.",

        "Abstract": "The analysis of cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs), which are present at significant levels in the blood of cancer patients, can reveal the mutational spectrum of a tumour without the need for invasive sampling of the tissue. However, this requires differentiation between the nucleic acids that originate from healthy cells and the mutated sequences shed by tumour cells. Here we report an electrochemical clamp assay that directly detects mutated sequences in patient serum. This is the first successful detection of cfNAs without the need for enzymatic amplification, a step that normally requires extensive sample processing and is prone to interference. The new chip-based assay reads out the presence of mutations within 15 minutes using a collection of oligonucleotides that sequester closely related sequences in solution, and thus allow only the mutated sequence to bind to a chip-based sensor. We demonstrate excellent levels of sensitivity and specificity and show that the clamp assay accurately detects mutated sequences in a collection of samples taken from lung cancer and melanoma patients.",

        "Abstract": "The isolation and rapid molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a liquid biopsy could enable the convenient and effective characterization of the state and aggressiveness of cancerous tumors. Existing technologies enumerate CTCs using immunostaining; however, these approaches are slow, labor-intensive, and often fail to enable further genetic characterization of CTCs. Here, we report on an integrated circuit that combines the capture of CTCs with the profiling of their gene expression signatures. Specifically, we use a velocity valley chip to efficiently capture magnetic nanoparticle-bound CTCs, which are then directly analyzed for their gene expression profiles using nanostructured microelectrode biosensors. CTCs are captured with 97% efficiency from 2 mL of whole blood, yielding a 500-fold concentration within 1 h. We show efficient capture of as few as 2 cancer cells/(mL of blood) and demonstrate that the gene expression module accurately profiles the expression of prostate-specific genes in CTCs captured from whole blood. This advance provides the first sample-to-answer solution for gene-based testing of CTCs. The approach was successfully validated using samples collected from prostate cancer patients: both CTCs and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA sequences were detected in all cancer patient samples and not in the healthy controls.",

        "Abstract": "Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming commensals that reside in the gut of many animal species. Described more than forty years ago, SFB have recently gained interest due to their unique ability to modulate the host immune system through induction of IgA and Th17 cells. Here, we describe a collection of methods to detect and quantify SFB and SFB adhesion in intestinal mucosa, as well as SFB-specific CD4 T cells in the lamina propria. In addition, we describe methods for purification of SFB from fecal material of SFB-monoassociated gnotobiotic mice. Using these methods we examine the kinetics of SFB colonization and Th17 cell induction. We also show that SFB colonize unevenly the intestinal mucosa and that SFB adherence occurs predominantly in the terminal ileum and correlates with an increased proportion of SFB-specific Th17 cells.",

        "Abstract": "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a pivotal replication protein, which also controls cellular responses to DNA damage. Posttranslational modification of PCNA by SUMO and ubiquitin modulate these responses. How the modifiers alter PCNA-dependent DNA repair and damage tolerance pathways is largely unknown. We used hybrid methods to identify atomic models of PCNAK107-Ub and PCNAK164-SUMO consistent with small-angle X-ray scattering data of these complexes in solution. We show that SUMO and ubiquitin have distinct modes of association to PCNA. Ubiquitin adopts discrete docked binding positions. By contrast, SUMO associates by simple tethering and adopts extended flexible conformations. These structural differences are the result of the opposite electrostatic potentials of SUMO and Ub. The unexpected contrast in conformational behavior of Ub-PCNA and SUMO-PCNA has implications for interactions with partner proteins, interacting surfaces accessibility, and access points for pathway regulation.",

        "Abstract": "This paper discusses a reaction of phosphorylated α-hydroxyallenes with protected or unprotected hydroxy groups involving 5-endo-trig cyclizations. Various electrophilic reagents such as sulfuryl chloride, bromine, benzenesulfenyl and benzeneselenenyl chlorides have been applied. The paper describes the reaction of 1-hydroxyalkyl-1,2-dienephosphonates with electrophiles that produces 2-methoxy-2-oxo-2,5-dihydro-1,2-oxaphospholes due to the participation of the phosphonate neighbouring group in the cyclization. On the other hand, (1E)-alk-1-en-1-yl phosphine oxides were prepared as mixtures with 2,5-dihydro-1,2-oxaphosphol-2-ium halides in a ratio of about 1:2 by chemo-, regio, and stereoselective electrophilic addition to the C(2)-C(3)-double bond in the allene moiety and subsequent concurrent attack of the external (halide anion) and internal (phosphine oxide group) nucleophiles. The paper proposes a possible mechanism that involves cyclization and additional reactions of the phosphorylated α-hydroxyallenes.",

        "Abstract": "Stop codon readthrough is used extensively by viruses to expand their gene expression. Until recent discoveries in Drosophila, only a very limited number of readthrough cases in chromosomal genes had been reported. Analysis of conserved protein coding signatures that extend beyond annotated stop codons identified potential stop codon readthrough of four mammalian genes. Here we use a modified targeted bioinformatic approach to identify a further three mammalian readthrough candidates. All seven genes were tested experimentally using reporter constructs transfected into HEK-293T cells. Four displayed efficient stop codon readthrough, and these have UGA immediately followed by CUAG. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that in the four readthrough candidates containing UGA-CUAG, this motif is conserved not only in mammals but throughout vertebrates with the first six of the seven nucleotides being universally conserved. The importance of the CUAG motif was confirmed using a systematic mutagenesis approach. One gene, OPRL1, encoding an opiate receptor, displayed extremely efficient levels of readthrough (∼31%) in HEK-293T cells. Signals both 5' and 3' of the OPRL1 stop codon contribute to this high level of readthrough. The sequence UGA-CUA alone can support 1.5% readthrough, underlying its importance.",

        "Abstract": "Alkylpurine glycosylase D (AlkD) exhibits a unique base excision strategy. Instead of interacting directly with the lesion, the enzyme engages the non-lesion DNA strand. AlkD induces flipping of the alkylated and opposing base accompanied by DNA stack compression. Since this strategy leaves the alkylated base solvent exposed, the means to achieve enzymatic cleavage had remained unclear. We determined a minimum energy path for flipping out a 3-methyl adenine by AlkD and computed a potential of mean force along this path to delineate the energetics of base extrusion. We show that AlkD acts as a scaffold to stabilize three distinct DNA conformations, including the final extruded state. These states are almost equivalent in free energy and separated by low barriers. Thus, AlkD acts by sculpting the global DNA conformation to achieve lesion expulsion from DNA. N-glycosidic bond scission is then facilitated by a backbone phosphate group proximal to the alkylated base.",

        "Abstract": "How commensal microbiota contributes to immune cell homeostasis at barrier surfaces is poorly understood. Lamina propria (LP) T helper 17 (Th17) cells participate in mucosal protection and are induced by commensal segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB). Here we show that MHCII-dependent antigen presentation of SFB antigens by intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) is crucial for Th17 cell induction. Expression of MHCII on CD11c(+) cells was necessary and sufficient for SFB-induced Th17 cell differentiation. Most SFB-induced Th17 cells recognized SFB in an MHCII-dependent manner. SFB primed and induced Th17 cells locally in the LP and Th17 cell induction occurred normally in mice lacking secondary lymphoid organs. The importance of other innate cells was unveiled by the finding that MHCII deficiency in group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) resulted in an increase in SFB-independent Th17 cell differentiation. Our results outline the complex role of DCs and ILCs in the regulation of intestinal Th17 cell homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the checkpoint clamp Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 topologically encircle DNA and act as mobile platforms in the recruitment of proteins involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. To fulfill these vital cellular functions, both clamps need to be opened and loaded onto DNA by a clamp loader complex-a process, which involves disruption of the DNA clamp's subunit interfaces. Herein, we compare the relative stabilities of the interfaces using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann solvent accessible surface method. We identify the Rad9-Rad1 interface as the weakest and, therefore, most likely to open during clamp loading. We also delineate the dominant interface disruption pathways under external forces in multiple-trajectory steered molecular dynamics runs. We show that, similar to the case of protein folding, clamp opening may not proceed through a single interface breakdown mechanism. Instead, we identify an ensemble of opening pathways, some more prevalent than others, characterized by specific groups of contacts that differentially stabilize the regions of the interface and determine the spatial and temporal patterns of breakdown. In Rad9-Rad1-Hus1, the Rad9-Rad1 and Rad9-Hus1 interfaces share the same dominant unzipping pathway, whereas the Hus1-Rad1 interface is disrupted concertedly with no preferred directionality.",

        "Abstract": "In eukaryotic cells initiation may occur from near-cognate codons that differ from AUG by a single nucleotide. The stringency of start codon selection impacts the efficiency of initiation at near-cognate codons and the efficiency of initiation at AUG codons in different contexts. We used a codon-optimized firefly luciferase reporter initiated with AUG or each of the nine near-cognate codons in preferred context to examine the stringency of start codon selection in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. In vivo results indicated that the hierarchy of initiation at start codons in N. crassa (AUG ≫ CUG > GUG > ACG > AUA ≈ UUG > AUU > AUC) is similar to that in human cells. Similar results were obtained by translating mRNAs in a homologous N. crassa in vitro translation system or in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We next examined the efficiency of initiation at AUG, CUG, and UUG codons in different contexts in vitro. The preferred context was more important for efficient initiation from near-cognate codons than from AUG. These studies demonstrated that near-cognate codons are used for initiation in N. crassa. Such events could provide additional coding capacity or have regulatory functions. Analyses of the 5'-leader regions in the N. crassa transcriptome revealed examples of highly conserved near-cognate codons in preferred contexts that could extend the N termini of the predicted polypeptides.",

        "Abstract": "Commensal bacteria regulate the homeostasis of host effector immune cell subsets. The mechanisms involved in this commensal-host crosstalk are not well understood. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) not only create a physical barrier between the commensals and immune cells in host tissues, but also facilitate interactions between them. Perturbations of epithelial homeostasis or function lead to the development of intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and intestinal cancer. IECs receive signals from commensals and produce effector immune molecules. IECs also affect the function of immune cells in the lamina propria. Here we discuss some of these properties of IECs that define them as innate immune cells. We focus on how IECs may integrate and transmit signals from individual commensal bacteria to mucosal innate and adaptive immune cells for the establishment of the unique mucosal immunological equilibrium.",

Here we describe a chip-based method using nanostructured microelectrodes and electrochemical readout that confirms the identity of isolated CTCs and successfully interrogates them for specific biomarkers. We successfully analyze and classify prostate tumor cells, first in cultured cells, and ultimately in a pilot study involving blood samples from 16 prostate cancer patients as well as additional healthy controls. In all cases, and for all biomarkers investigated, the novel chip-based assay produced results that agreed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The approach developed has a simple workflow and scalable multiplexing, which makes it ideal for further studies of CTC biomarkers.",

Harnessing the ability of microbiota to affect host immunity is considered an important therapeutic strategy for many mucosal and nonmucosal immune-related conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), celiac disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and microbial infections. In addition to well-established immunostimulatory effects of the microbiota, the presence of individual mutualistic commensal bacteria with immunomodulatory effects has been described. These organisms are permanent members of the commensal microbiota and affect host immune homeostasis in specific ways. Identification of individual examples of such immunomodulatory commensals and understanding their mechanisms of interaction with the host will be invaluable in designing therapeutic strategies to reverse intestinal dysbiosis and recover immunological homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Processivity clamps such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the checkpoint sliding clamp Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 (9-1-1) act as versatile scaffolds in the coordinated recruitment of proteins involved in DNA replication, cell-cycle control, and DNA repair. Association and handoff of DNA-editing enzymes, such as flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), with sliding clamps are key processes in biology, which are incompletely understood from a mechanistic point of view. We have used an integrative computational and experimental approach to define the assemblies of FEN1 with double-flap DNA substrates and either proliferating cell nuclear antigen or the checkpoint sliding clamp 9-1-1. Fully atomistic models of these two ternary complexes were developed and refined through extensive molecular dynamics simulations to expose their conformational dynamics. Clustering analysis revealed the most dominant conformations accessible to the complexes. The cluster centroids were subsequently used in conjunction with single-particle electron microscopy data to obtain a 3D EM reconstruction of the human 9-1-1/FEN1/DNA assembly at 18-Å resolution. Comparing the structures of the complexes revealed key differences in the orientation and interactions of FEN1 and double-flap DNA with the two clamps that are consistent with their respective functions in providing inherent flexibility for lagging strand DNA replication or inherent stability for DNA repair.",

The observed differences in the enzyme expression were confirmed by measuring the enzyme hydrolysis of glycyl-L-prolyl-para-nitroanilide. The surface and total dipeptidyl peptidase activities of P cells were correspondingly 7-8 and 3-10 times higher than those of SK-MES-1 and A549 cells. The ratio surface per total activity showed that in P (95%) and A549 (93%) cells the enzyme is associated with the plasmalemma while in SK-MES-1 cells (35%) it is bound to intracellular membranes. In order to compare the results from cell cultures with those in human tumor, the enzyme activity was investigated in cryo-sections of three cases of diagnosed squamous lung carcinoma. DPPIV activity was restricted to the connective tissue stroma surrounding the DPPIV-negative tumor foci.",

        "Title": "Stringency of start codon selection modulates autoregulation of translation initiation factor eIF5.",
        "Abstract": "An AUG in an optimal nucleotide context is the preferred translation initiation site in eukaryotic cells. Interactions among translation initiation factors, including eIF1 and eIF5, govern start codon selection. Experiments described here showed that high intracellular eIF5 levels reduced the stringency of start codon selection in human cells. In contrast, high intracellular eIF1 levels increased stringency. High levels of eIF5 induced translation of inhibitory upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in eIF5 mRNA that initiate with AUG codons in conserved poor contexts. This resulted in reduced translation from the downstream eIF5 start codon, indicating that eIF5 autoregulates its own synthesis. As with eIF1, which is also autoregulated through translation initiation, features contributing to eIF5 autoregulation show deep evolutionary conservation. The results obtained provide the basis for a model in which auto- and cross-regulation of eIF5 and eIF1 translation establish a regulatory feedback loop that would stabilize the stringency of start codon selection.",

        "Title": "Solution X-ray scattering combined with computational modeling reveals multiple conformations of covalently bound ubiquitin on PCNA.",
        "Abstract": "PCNA ubiquitination in response to DNA damage leads to the recruitment of specialized translesion polymerases to the damage locus. This constitutes one of the initial steps in translesion synthesis (TLS)--a critical pathway for cell survival and for maintenance of genome stability. The recent crystal structure of ubiquitinated PCNA (Ub-PCNA) sheds light on the mode of association between the two proteins but also revealed that paradoxically, the ubiquitin surface engaged in PCNA interactions was the same as the surface implicated in translesion polymerase binding. This finding implied a degree of flexibility inherent in the Ub-PCNA complex that would allow it to transition into a conformation competent to bind the TLS polymerase. To address the issue of segmental flexibility, we combined multiscale computational modeling and small angle X-ray scattering. This combined strategy revealed alternative positions for ubiquitin to reside on the surface of the PCNA homotrimer, distinct from the position identified in the crystal structure. Two mutations originally identified in genetic screens and known to interfere with TLS are positioned directly beneath the bound ubiquitin in the alternative models. These computationally derived positions, in an ensemble with the crystallographic and flexible positions, provided the best fit to the solution scattering, indicating that ubiquitin dynamically associated with PCNA and is capable of transitioning between a few discrete sites on the PCNA surface. The finding of new docking sites and the positional equilibrium of PCNA-Ub occurring in solution provide unexpected insight into previously unexplained biological observations.",

        "Title": "Developmental study of tripeptidyl peptidase I activity in the mouse central nervous system and peripheral organs.",
        "Abstract": "Tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPPI) - a lysosomal serine protease - is encoded by the CLN2 gene, mutations that cause late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) connected with profound neuronal loss, severe clinical symptoms and early death at puberty. Developmental studies of TPPI activity levels and distribution have been done in the human and rat central nervous systems (CNS) and visceral organs. Similar studies have not been performed in mouse. In this paper, we follow up on the developmental changes in the enzyme activity and localization pattern in the CNS and visceral organs of mouse over the main periods of life - embryonic, neonate, suckling, infantile, juvenile, adult and aged - using biochemical assays and enzyme histochemistry. In the studied peripheral organs (liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas and lung) TPPI is present at birth but further its pattern is not consistent in different organs over different life periods. TPPI activity starts to be expressed in the brain at the 10th embryonic day but in most neuronal types it appears at the early infantile period, increases during infancy, reaches high activity levels in the juvenile period and is highest in adult and aged animals. Thus, in mice TPPI activity becomes crucial for the neuronal functions later in development (juvenile period) than in humans and does not decrease with aging. These results are essential as a basis for comparison between normal and pathological TPPI patterns in mice. They can be valuable in view of the use of animal models for studying LINCL and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Perturbations of the composition of the symbiotic intestinal microbiota can have profound consequences for host metabolism and immunity. In mice, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) direct the accumulation of potentially proinflammatory Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria. We present the genome sequence of SFB isolated from monocolonized mice, which classifies SFB phylogenetically as a unique member of Clostridiales with a highly reduced genome. Annotation analysis demonstrates that SFB depend on their environment for amino acids and essential nutrients and may utilize host and dietary glycans for carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Comparative analyses reveal that SFB are functionally related to members of the genus Clostridium and several pathogenic or commensal \"minimal\" genera, including Finegoldia, Mycoplasma, Borrelia, and Phytoplasma. However, SFB are functionally distinct from all 1200 examined genomes, indicating a gene complement representing biology relatively unique to their role as a gut commensal closely tied to host metabolism and immunity.",

        "Abstract": "The programmed, stepwise acquisition of immunocompetence that marks the development of the fetal immune response proceeds during a period when both T cell receptor and immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoires exhibit reduced junctional diversity due to physiologic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) insufficiency. To test the effect of N addition on humoral responses, we transplanted bone marrow from TdT-deficient (TdT(-/-)) and wild-type (TdT(+/+)) BALB/c mice into recombination activation gene 1-deficient BALB/c hosts. Mice transplanted with TdT(-/-) cells exhibited diminished humoral responses to the T-independent antigens α-1-dextran and (2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) hapten conjugated to AminoEthylCarboxymethyl-FICOLL, to the T-dependent antigens NP(19)CGG and hen egg lysozyme, and to Enterobacter cloacae, a commensal bacteria that can become an opportunistic pathogen in immature and immunocompromised hosts. An exception to this pattern of reduction was the T-independent anti-phosphorylcholine response to Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is normally dominated by the N-deficient T15 idiotype. Most of the humoral immune responses in the recipients of TdT(-/-) bone marrow were impaired, yet population of the blood with B and T cells occurred more rapidly. To further test the effect of N-deficiency on B cell and T cell population growth, transplanted TdT-sufficient and -deficient BALB/c IgM(a) and congenic TdT-sufficient CB17 IgM(b) bone marrow were placed in competition. TdT(-/-) cells demonstrated an advantage in populating the bone marrow, the spleen, and the peritoneal cavity. TdT deficiency, which characterizes fetal lymphocytes, thus appears to facilitate filling both central and peripheral lymphoid compartments, but at the cost of altered responses to a broad set of antigens.",

        "Abstract": "In eukaryotes, it is generally assumed that translation initiation occurs at the AUG codon closest to the messenger RNA 5' cap. However, in certain cases, initiation can occur at codons differing from AUG by a single nucleotide, especially the codons CUG, UUG, GUG, ACG, AUA and AUU. While non-AUG initiation has been experimentally verified for a handful of human genes, the full extent to which this phenomenon is utilized--both for increased coding capacity and potentially also for novel regulatory mechanisms--remains unclear. To address this issue, and hence to improve the quality of existing coding sequence annotations, we developed a methodology based on phylogenetic analysis of predicted 5' untranslated regions from orthologous genes. We use evolutionary signatures of protein-coding sequences as an indicator of translation initiation upstream of annotated coding sequences. Our search identified novel conserved potential non-AUG-initiated N-terminal extensions in 42 human genes including VANGL2, FGFR1, KCNN4, TRPV6, HDGF, CITED2, EIF4G3 and NTF3, and also affirmed the conservation of known non-AUG-initiated extensions in 17 other genes. In several instances, we have been able to obtain independent experimental evidence of the expression of non-AUG-initiated products from the previously published literature and ribosome profiling data.",

        "Title": "Ion selectivity mechanism in a bacterial pentameric ligand-gated ion channel.",
        "Abstract": "The proton-gated ion channel from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) is a prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that responds to the binding of neurotransmitter acetylcholine and mediates fast signal transmission. Recent emergence of a high-resolution crystal structure of GLIC captured in a potentially open state allowed detailed, atomic-level insight into ion conduction and selectivity mechanisms in these channels. Herein, we have examined the barriers to ion conduction and origins of ion selectivity in the GLIC channel by the construction of potential-of-mean-force profiles for sodium and chloride ions inside the transmembrane region. Our calculations reveal that the GLIC channel is open for a sodium ion to transport, but presents a ∼11 kcal/mol free energy barrier for a chloride ion. Our collective findings identify three distinct contributions to the observed preference for the permeant ions. First, there is a substantial contribution due to a ring of negatively charged glutamate residues (E-2') at the narrow intracellular end of the channel. The negative electrostatics of this region and the ability of the glutamate side chains to directly bind cations would strongly favor the passage of sodium ions while hindering translocation of chloride ions. Second, our results imply a significant hydrophobic contribution to selectivity linked to differences in the desolvation penalty for the sodium versus chloride ions in the central hydrophobic region of the pore. This hydrophobic contribution is evidenced by the large free energy barriers experienced by Cl⁻ in the middle of the pore for both GLIC and the E-2'A mutant. Finally, there is a distinct contribution arising from the overall negative electrostatics of the channel.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal bacteria form a resident community that has co-evolved with the mammalian host. In addition to playing important roles in digestion and harvesting energy, commensal bacteria are crucial for the proper functioning of mucosal immune defenses. Most of these functions have been attributed to the presence of large numbers of 'innocuous' resident bacteria that dilute or occupy niches for intestinal pathogens or induce innate immune responses that sequester bacteria in the lumen, thus quenching excessive activation of the mucosal immune system. However it has recently become obvious that commensal bacteria are not simply beneficial bystanders, but are important modulators of intestinal immune homeostasis and that the composition of the microbiota is a major factor in pre-determining the type and robustness of mucosal immune responses. Here we review specific examples of individual members of the microbiota that modify innate and adaptive immune responses, and we focus on potential mechanisms by which such species-specific signals are generated and transmitted to the host immune system.",

        "Abstract": "Compared with adult bone marrow (BM), the composition of the perinatal liver CDR-3 of the Ig H chain (CDR-H3) repertoire is marked by a paucity of N nucleotides and by enrichment for use of J(H) proximal DQ52 and D(H) proximal V(H) and J(H) gene segments. To test the extent to which these differences reflect limited perinatal TdT activity versus differences in the fetal/adult environment, we used the Hardy scheme to sort fractions B-F B lineage cells from TdT-deficient BALB/c adult BM. V(H)7183-containing VDJCμ transcripts from these cells were amplified, cloned, sequenced, and compared with transcripts from wild-type perinatal liver and adult BM. The pattern of V(H)DJ(H) usage in TdT-deficient BM largely matched that of TdT-sufficient adult cells. What minor differences were detected in the pro-B cell stage tended to diminish with B cell maturation, suggesting strong environmental or Ag-driven pressure to achieve a specific range of V(H)DJ(H) usage regardless of the extent of N nucleotide addition. However, although the patterns of V(H)DJ(H) usage in the TdT-deficient B lineage cells paralleled that of wild-type adult cells, the length distribution, global amino acid composition, and charge distribution of the CDR-H3 repertoire proved to be a close, although not exact, homologue of the CDR-H3 repertoire first expressed by late pre-B cells in the TdT-insufficient perinatal liver. Thus, although differing in V(H) content, TdT-deficient mice appear to represent a good, although not perfect, model for testing the role of perinatal CDR-H3 limitations on late B cell development and Ab responses.",

        "Abstract": "The central feature of standard eukaryotic translation initiation is small ribosome subunit loading at the 5' cap followed by its 5' to 3' scanning for a start codon. The preferred start is an AUG codon in an optimal context. Elaborate cellular machinery exists to ensure the fidelity of start codon selection. Eukaryotic initiation factor 1 (eIF1) plays a central role in this process. Here we show that the translation of eIF1 homologs in eukaryotes from diverse taxa involves initiation from an AUG codon in a poor context. Using human eIF1 as a model, we show that this poor context is necessary for an autoregulatory negative feedback loop in which a high level of eIF1 inhibits its own translation, establishing that variability in the stringency of start codon selection is used for gene regulation in eukaryotes. We show that the stringency of start codon selection (preferential utilization of optimal start sites) is increased to a surprising degree by overexpressing eIF1. The capacity for the cellular level of eIF1 to impact initiation through the variable stringency of initiation codon selection likely has significant consequences for the proteome in eukaryotes.",

        "Title": "Sequence requirements for ribosome stalling by the arginine attenuator peptide.",
        "Abstract": "The 5' regions of eukaryotic mRNAs often contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs). The Neurospora crassa arg-2 uORF encodes the 24-residue arginine attenuator peptide (AAP). This regulatory uORF-encoded peptide, which is evolutionarily conserved in fungal transcripts specifying an arginine biosynthetic enzyme, functions as a nascent peptide within the ribosomal tunnel and negatively regulates gene expression. The nascent AAP causes ribosomes to stall at the uORF stop codon in response to arginine, thus, blocking ribosomes from reaching the ARG-2 initiation codon. Here scanning mutagenesis with alanine and proline was performed to systematically determine which AAP residues were important for conferring regulation. Changing many of the most highly conserved residues (Asp-12, Tyr-13, Lys-14, and Trp-19) abolished regulatory function. The minimal functional domain of the AAP was determined by positioning AAP sequences internally within a large polypeptide. Pulse-chase analyses revealed that residues 9-20 of the AAP composed the minimal domain that was sufficient to confer regulatory function. An extensive analysis of predicted fungal AAPs revealed that the minimal functional domain of the N. crassa AAP corresponded closely to the region that was most highly conserved among the fungi. We also observed that the tripeptide RGD could function similarly to arginine in triggering AAP-mediated ribosome stalling. These studies provide a better understanding of the elements required for a nascent peptide and a small regulatory molecule to control translational processes.",

        "Abstract": "Commensal microbes can have a substantial impact on autoimmune disorders, but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. We report that autoimmune arthritis was strongly attenuated in the K/BxN mouse model under germ-free (GF) conditions, accompanied by reductions in serum autoantibody titers, splenic autoantibody-secreting cells, germinal centers, and the splenic T helper 17 (Th17) cell population. Neutralization of interleukin-17 prevented arthritis development in specific-pathogen-free K/BxN mice resulting from a direct effect of this cytokine on B cells to inhibit germinal center formation. The systemic deficiencies of the GF animals reflected a loss of Th17 cells from the small intestinal lamina propria. Introduction of a single gut-residing species, segmented filamentous bacteria, into GF animals reinstated the lamina propria Th17 cell compartment and production of autoantibodies, and arthritis rapidly ensued. Thus, a single commensal microbe, via its ability to promote a specific Th cell subset, can drive an autoimmune disease.",

        "Abstract": "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, sliding clamp) is a toroidal-shaped protein that encircles DNA and plays a pivotal role in DNA replication, modification and repair. To perform its vital functions, the clamp has to be opened and resealed at primer-template junctions by a clamp loader molecular machine, replication factor C (RFC). The mechanism of this process constitutes a significant piece in the puzzle of processive DNA replication. We show that upon clamp opening the RFC/PCNA complex undergoes a large conformational rearrangement, leading to the formation of an extended interface between the clamp and RFC. Binding of ring-open PCNA to all five RFC subunits transforms the free-energy landscape underlying the closed- to open state transition, trapping PCNA in an open conformation. Careful comparison of free-energy profiles for clamp opening in the presence and absence of RFC allowed us to substantiate the role of RFC in the initial stage of the clamp-loading cycle. RFC does not appreciably destabilize the closed state of PCNA. Instead, the function of the clamp loader is dependent on the selective stabilization of the open conformation of the clamp.",

        "Title": "Recurrent emergence of catalytically inactive ornithine decarboxylase homologous forms that likely have regulatory function.",
        "Abstract": "Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) catalyzes the first and rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of polyamines in most eukaryotes. Because polyamines have pleiotropic and often dramatic effects on cellular processes at both high and low concentrations, ODC expression is tightly controlled. ODC is regulated by a family of polyamine-induced proteins, antizymes, which bind to, and inactivate it. In mammals, and apparently most vertebrates, antizymes are in turn antagonized by proteins called antizyme inhibitors. Antizyme inhibitors are homologs of ODC that have lost their decarboxylation activity but have retained their ability to bind antizyme, in most cases even more tightly than ODC. We present a phylogenetic analysis of over 200 eukaryotic homologs of ODC and evaluate their potential to be either true ODCs or catalytically inactive proteins that might be analogs of the previously identified antizyme inhibitors. This analysis yielded several orthologous groups of putative novel antizyme inhibitors each apparently arising independently. In the process we also identify previously unrecognized ODC paralogs in several evolutionary branches, including a previously unrecognized ODC paralog in mammals, and we evaluate their biochemical potential based on their pattern of amino acid conservation.",

        "Abstract": "In many eukaryotic mRNAs one or more short 'upstream' open reading frames, uORFs, precede the initiator of the main coding sequence. Upstream ORFs are functionally diverse as illustrated by their variety of features in polyamine pathway biosynthetic mRNAs. Their propensity to act as sensors for regulatory circuits and to amplify the signals likely explains their occurrence in most polyamine pathway mRNAs. The uORF-mediated polyamine responsive autoregulatory circuits found in polyamine pathway mRNAs exemplify the translationally regulated dynamic interface between components of the proteome and metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract of mammals is inhabited by hundreds of distinct species of commensal microorganisms that exist in a mutualistic relationship with the host. How commensal microbiota influence the host immune system is poorly understood. We show here that colonization of the small intestine of mice with a single commensal microbe, segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB), is sufficient to induce the appearance of CD4(+) T helper cells that produce IL-17 and IL-22 (Th17 cells) in the lamina propria. SFB adhere tightly to the surface of epithelial cells in the terminal ileum of mice with Th17 cells but are absent from mice that have few Th17 cells. Colonization with SFB was correlated with increased expression of genes associated with inflammation and antimicrobial defenses and resulted in enhanced resistance to the intestinal pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Thus, manipulation of this commensal-regulated pathway may provide new opportunities for enhancing mucosal immunity and treating autoimmune disease.",

        "Abstract": "The specificity of 10 recombinant caspases was investigated using a set of competitive substrates. The caspase activity was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using highly fluorescent peptides containing 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) as reporting group. The sequences of the used substrates were designed according to literature data for being specific for 10 of the caspases. The described approach allows the concentration changes of several substrates to be monitored simultaneously in a single sample. Because the substrates are in competitive conditions, the preferences of particular caspases to given peptide sequences are most clearly demonstrated. In the studied competitive assay conditions, all tested caspases except caspase 2 exhibit activity toward more than one substrate. None of the used peptide sequences was found to be highly specific for a defined caspase. The results obtained indicate that there is well-expressed group specificity among the caspases.",

        "Abstract": "The ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) is a prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that responds to the binding of neurotransmitter acetylcholine and mediates fast signal transmission. ELIC is similar to the nAChR in its primary sequence and overall subunit organization, but despite their structural similarity, it is not clear whether these two ligand-gated ion channels operate in a similar manner. Further, it is not known to what extent mechanistic insights gleaned from the ELIC structure translate to eukaryotic counterparts such as the nAChR. Here we use molecular-dynamics simulations to probe the conformational dynamics and hydration of the transmembrane pore of ELIC. The results are compared with those from our previous simulation of the human alpha7 nAChR. Overall, ELIC displays increased stability compared to the nAChR, whereas the two proteins exhibit remarkable similarity in their global motion and flexibility patterns. The majority of the increased stability of ELIC does not stem from the deficiency of the models used in the simulations, and but rather seems to have a structural basis. Slightly altered dynamical correlation features are also observed among several loops within the membrane region. In sharp contrast to the nAChR, ELIC is completely dehydrated from the pore center to the extracellular end throughout the simulation. Finally, the simulation of an ELIC mutant substantiates the important role of F246 on the stability, hydration and possibly function of the ELIC channel.",

        "Abstract": "A new set of experimental kinetic data on the hydrolysis of a series of phenylacetyl p-substituted anilides catalyzed by penicillin G acylase from Escherichia coli (PGA) is presented in this article. The Hammett plot of log(k(cat,R)/k(cat,H)) versus sigma(p) (-) has three linear segments, which distinguishes the enzyme from the other N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases for which data are available. Three amino acids in the vicinity of the catalytic SerB1 (AsnB241, AlaB69, and GlnB23) were included in the quantum mechanical model. The stable structures and the transition states for acylation were optimized by molecular mechanical modeling and at the AM1 level of theory for three model substrates (with H, a methoxy group or a nitro group in the para position in the leaving group). Intrinsic interactions of several functional groups at the active site of PGA are discussed in relation to the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The energy barrier computed for the first step of acylation (the nucleophilic attack of SerB1) is lower than that for the second step (the collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate). However, the electronic properties of the substituent on the leaving group affect the structure of the second transition state. It is shown that the main chain carbonyl group of GlnB23 forms a hydrogen bond with the leaving group nitrogen, thus influencing the hydrolysis rate. On the basis of our computations, we propose an interpretation of the complex character of the Hammett plot for the reaction catalyzed by PGA. We suggest a modified scheme of the catalytic mechanism in which some of the intramolecular interactions essential for catalysis are included.",

        "Abstract": "The comparative dynamics and inhibitor binding free energies of group-1 and group-2 pathogenic influenza A subtype neuraminidase (NA) enzymes are of fundamental biological interest and relevant to structure-based drug design studies for antiviral compounds. In this work, we present seven generalized Born molecular dynamics simulations of avian (N1)- and human (N9)-type NAs in order to probe the comparative flexibility of the two subtypes, both with and without the inhibitor oseltamivir bound. The enhanced sampling obtained through the implicit solvent treatment suggests several provocative insights into the dynamics of the two subtypes, including that the group-2 enzymes may exhibit similar motion in the 430-binding site regions but different 150-loop motion. End-point free energy calculations elucidate the contributions to inhibitor binding free energies and suggest that entropic considerations cannot be neglected when comparing across the subtypes. We anticipate the findings presented here will have broad implications for the development of novel antiviral compounds against both seasonal and pandemic influenza strains.",

        "Abstract": "NKp46+CD3- natural killer lymphocytes isolated from blood, lymphoid organs, lung, liver and uterus can produce granule-dependent cytotoxicity and interferon-gamma. Here we identify in dermis, gut lamina propria and cryptopatches distinct populations of NKp46+CD3- cells with a diminished capacity to degranulate and produce interferon-gamma. In the gut, expression of the transcription factor RORgammat, which is involved in the development of lymphoid tissue-inducer cells, defined a previously unknown subset of NKp46+CD3- lymphocytes. Unlike RORgammat- lamina propria and dermis natural killer cells, gut RORgammat+NKp46+ cells produced interleukin 22. Our data show that lymphoid tissue-inducer cells and natural killer cells shared unanticipated similarities and emphasize the heterogeneity of NKp46+CD3- cells in innate immunity, lymphoid organization and local tissue repair.",

        "Abstract": "The requirements for in vivo steady state differentiation of IL-17-producing T-helper (Th17) cells, which are potent inflammation effectors, remain obscure. We report that Th17 cell differentiation in the lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine requires specific commensal microbiota and is inhibited by treating mice with selective antibiotics. Mice from different sources had marked differences in their Th17 cell numbers and animals lacking Th17 cells acquired them after introduction of bacteria from Th17 cell-sufficient mice. Differentiation of Th17 cells correlated with the presence of cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroidetes (CFB) bacteria in the intestine and was independent of toll-like receptor, IL-21 or IL-23 signaling, but required appropriate TGF-beta activation. Absence of Th17 cell-inducing bacteria was accompanied by increase in Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in the LP. Our results suggest that composition of intestinal microbiota regulates the Th17:Treg balance in the LP and may thus influence intestinal immunity, tolerance, and susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases.",

        "Abstract": "In a minority of eukaryotic mRNAs, a small functional upstream ORF (uORF), often performing a regulatory role, precedes the translation start site for the main product(s). Here, conserved uORFs in numerous ornithine decarboxylase homologs are identified from yeast to mammals. Most have noncanonical evolutionarily conserved start codons, the main one being AUU, which has not been known as an initiator for eukaryotic chromosomal genes. The AUG-less uORF present in mouse antizyme inhibitor, one of the ornithine decarboxylase homologs in mammals, mediates polyamine-induced repression of the downstream main ORF. This repression is part of an autoregulatory circuit, and one of its sensors is the AUU codon, which suggests that translation initiation codon identity is likely used for regulation in eukaryotes.",

The reaction of MIAC with aminothiols is specific, very fast and yield highly fluorescent products. The HPLC method for determination of homocysteine, cysteine and glutathione based on utilization of MIAC is developed. A baseline separation of derivatives is achieved by isocratic elution on reverse phase column within 6 min. The method is linear in the range of 0.5-25 microM for homocysteine and glutathione, and in the range of 0.5-200 microM for cysteine. The limits of detection for homocysteine, cysteine and glutathione are 1.2, 1.4 and 2.0 pmol, respectively, per 20 microl injection. Within and between-run precision expressed as relative standard deviations are in the range of 1.35-4.38% and 0.89-4.13%, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Ornithine decarboxylase antizymes are proteins which negatively regulate cellular polyamine levels via their affects on polyamine synthesis and cellular uptake. In virtually all organisms from yeast to mammals, antizymes are encoded by two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). A +1 frameshift between frames is required for the synthesis of antizyme. Ribosomes change translation phase at the end of the first ORF in response to stimulatory signals embedded in mRNA. Since standard sequence analysis pipelines are currently unable to recognise sites of programmed ribosomal frameshifting, proper detection of full length antizyme coding sequences (CDS) requires conscientious manual evaluation by a human expert. The rapid growth of sequence information demands less laborious and more cost efficient solutions for this problem. This manuscript describes a rapid and accurate computer tool for antizyme CDS detection that requires minimal human involvement.",

        "Abstract": "Infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance are now considered the most imperative global healthcare problem. In the search for new treatments, host defense, or antimicrobial, peptides have attracted considerable attention due to their various unique properties; however, attempts to develop in vivo therapies have been severely limited. Efforts to develop synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides (SMAMPs) have increased significantly in the last decade, and this review will focus primarily on the structural evolution of SMAMPs and their membrane activity. This review will attempt to make a bridge between the design of SMAMPs and the fundamentals of SMAMP-membrane interactions. In discussions regarding the membrane interaction of SMAMPs, close attention will be paid to the lipid composition of the bilayer. Despite many years of study, the exact conformational aspects responsible for the high selectivity of these AMPs and SMAMPs toward bacterial cells over mammalian cells are still not fully understood. The ability to design SMAMPs that are potently antimicrobial, yet nontoxic to mammalian cells has been demonstrated with a variety of molecular scaffolds. Initial animal studies show very good tissue distribution along with more than a 4-log reduction in bacterial counts. The results on SMAMPs are not only extremely promising for novel antibiotics, but also provide an optimistic picture for the greater challenge of general proteomimetics.",

This subset, referred to as Th17, is centrally involved in autoimmune disease and is important in host defense at mucosal surfaces. In mouse, a series of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, and TGF-beta, function sequentially or synergistically to induce the Th17 lineage. Other cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IFNgamma, and IL-27, inhibit differentiation of this lineage. Here we review how the nuclear orphan receptor RORgammat functions to coordinate the diverse cytokine-induced signals and thus controls Th17 cell differentiation.",

        "Title": "Dynamics of the acetylcholinesterase tetramer.",
        "Abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase rapidly hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses, including the neuromuscular junction. The tetramer is the most important functional form of the enzyme. Two low-resolution crystal structures have been solved. One is compact with two of its four peripheral anionic sites (PAS) sterically blocked by complementary subunits. The other is a loose tetramer with all four subunits accessible to solvent. These structures lacked the C-terminal amphipathic t-peptide (WAT domain) that interacts with the proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD). A complete tetramer model (AChEt) was built based on the structure of the PRAD/WAT complex and the compact tetramer. Normal mode analysis suggested that AChEt could exist in several conformations with subunits fluctuating relative to one another. Here, a multiscale simulation involving all-atom molecular dynamics and C alpha-based coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations was carried out to investigate the large-scale intersubunit dynamics in AChEt. We sampled the ns-mus timescale motions and found that the tetramer indeed constitutes a dynamic assembly of monomers. The intersubunit fluctuation is correlated with the occlusion of the PAS. Such motions of the subunits \"gate\" ligand-protein association. The gates are open more than 80% of the time on average, which suggests a small reduction in ligand-protein binding. Despite the limitations in the starting model and approximations inherent in coarse graining, these results are consistent with experiments which suggest that binding of a substrate to the PAS is only somewhat hindered by the association of the subunits.",

        "Abstract": "T helper cells that produce interleukin 17 (IL-17; 'T(H)-17 cells') are a distinct subset of proinflammatory cells whose in vivo function requires IL-23 but whose in vitro differentiation requires only IL-6 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We demonstrate here that IL-6 induced expression of IL-21 that amplified an autocrine loop to induce more IL-21 and IL-23 receptor in naive CD4(+) T cells. Both IL-21 and IL-23, along with TGF-beta, induced IL-17 expression independently of IL-6. The effects of IL-6 and IL-21 depended on STAT3, a transcription factor required for the differentiation of T(H)-17 cells in vivo. IL-21 and IL-23 induced the orphan nuclear receptor RORgammat, which in synergy with STAT3 promoted IL-17 expression. IL-6 therefore orchestrates a series of 'downstream' cytokine-dependent signaling pathways that, in concert with TGF-beta, amplify RORgammat-dependent differentiation of T(H)-17 cells.",

        "Abstract": "We explore the conformational dynamics of a homology model of the human alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor using molecular dynamics simulation and analyses of root mean-square fluctuations, block partitioning of segmental motion, and principal component analysis. The results reveal flexible regions and concerted global motions of the subunits encompassing extracellular and transmembrane domains of the subunits. The most relevant motions comprise a bending, hinged at the beta10-M1 region, accompanied by concerted tilting of the M2 helices that widens the intracellular end of the channel. Despite the nanosecond timescale, the observations suggest that tilting of the M2 helices may initiate opening of the pore. The results also reveal direct coupling between a twisting motion of the extracellular domain and dynamic changes of M2. Covariance analysis of interresidue motions shows that this coupling arises through a network of residues within the Cys and M2-M3 loops where Phe135 is stabilized within a hydrophobic pocket formed by Leu270 and Ile271. The resulting concerted motion causes a downward shift of the M2 helices that disrupts a hydrophobic girdle formed by 9' and 13' residues.",

        "Abstract": "Heterosubtypic immunity (HSI) is defined as cross-protection to infection with an influenza A virus serotype other than the one used for primary infection. Although HSI has been thought to be mediated by serotype cross-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that recognize conserved epitopes of structural proteins, recent studies suggest that antibodies (Abs) may make a significant contribution. In this study, we provide further evidence for the role of Abs in HSI using transgenic mice lacking terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase (TdT), which adds N nucleotides to V-D and D-J junctions of the complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) (TdT(-/-)) and mice with altered Ab repertoires due to replacement of the complete locus of heavy chain diversity segments (D(H)) with an altered D(H) segment (namely, Delta D-iD). Both types of mice failed to generate complete HSI, although they were able to mount protective immunity to a homologous challenge. Lower levels of virus-specific antibodies along with more severely impaired HSI were observed in TdT(-/-) mice compared to those in Delta D-iD mice, while CTL activity remained unchanged in both types of mice. These findings indicate that a properly diversified antibody repertoire is required for HSI and that N addition by TdT is a more effective mechanism in the induction of a properly diversified antibody repertoire and, therefore, complete HSI. The results suggest that the diversity of the antibody repertoire as determined by the composition of the D region of HCDR3 and by N addition are among the mechanisms selected for in evolution to create a favorable environment to resolve infections with mutated viruses.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms of gating and ion permeation in biological channels and receptors has been a long-standing challenge in biophysics. Recent advances in structural biology have revealed the architecture of a number of transmembrane channels and allowed detailed, molecular-level insight into these systems. Herein, we have examined the barriers to ion conductance and origins of ion selectivity in models of the cationic human alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and the anionic alpha1 glycine receptor (GlyR), based on the structure of Torpedo nAChR. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine water density profiles along the channel length, and they established that both receptor pores were fully hydrated. The very low water density in the middle of the nAChR pore indicated the existence of a hydrophobic constriction. By contrast, the pore of GlyR was lined with hydrophilic residues and remained well-hydrated throughout. Adaptive biasing force simulations allowed us to reconstruct potentials of mean force (PMFs) for chloride and sodium ions in the two receptors. For the nicotinic receptor we observed barriers to ion translocation associated with rings of hydrophobic residues-Val13' and Leu9'-in the middle of the transmembrane domain. This finding further substantiates the hydrophobic gating hypothesis for nAChR. The PMF revealed no significant hydrophobic barrier for chloride translocation in GlyR. For both receptors nonpermeant ions displayed considerable barriers. Thus, the overall electrostatics and the presence of rings of charged residues at the entrance and exit of the channels were sufficient to explain the experimentally observed anion and cation selectivity.",

        "Abstract": "The protein antizyme is a negative regulator of intracellular polyamine levels. Ribosomes synthesizing antizyme start in one ORF and at the codon 5' adjacent to its stop codon, shift +1 to a second and partially overlapping ORF which encodes most of the protein. The ribosomal frameshifting is a sensor and effector of an autoregulatory circuit which is conserved in animals, fungi and protists. Stimulatory signals encoded 5' and 3' of the shift site act to program the frameshifting. Despite overall conservation, many individual branches have evolved specific features surrounding the frameshift site. Among these are RNA pseudoknots, RNA stem-loops, conserved primary RNA sequences, nascent peptide sequences and branch-specific 'shifty' codons.",

        "Abstract": "Endonuclease IV belongs to a class of important apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases involved in DNA repair. Although a structure-based mechanistic hypothesis has been put forth for this enzyme, the detailed catalytic mechanism has remained unknown. Using thermodynamic integration in the context of ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics, we examined certain aspects of the phosphodiester cleavage step in the mechanism. We found the reaction proceeded through a synchronous bimolecular (A(N)D(N)) mechanism with reaction free energy and barrier of -3.5 and 20.6 kcal/mol, in agreement with experimental estimates. In the course of the reaction the trinuclear active site of endonuclease IV underwent dramatic local conformational changes: shifts in the mode of coordination of both substrate and first-shell ligands. This qualitative finding supports the notion that structural rearrangements in the active sites of multinuclear enzymes are integral to biological function.",

        "Abstract": "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a biologically essential processivity factor that encircles DNA and provides binding sites for polymerase, flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) and ligase during DNA replication and repair. We have computationally characterized the interactions of human and Archaeoglobus fulgidus PCNA trimer with double-stranded DNA (ds DNA) using multi-nanosecond classical molecular dynamics simulations. The results reveal the interactions of DNA passing through the PCNA trimeric ring including the contacts formed, overall orientation and motion with respect to the sliding clamp. Notably, we observe pronounced tilting of the axis of dsDNA with respect to the PCNA ring plane reflecting interactions between the DNA phosphodiester backbone and positively charged arginine and lysine residues lining the PCNA inner surface. Covariance matrix analysis revealed a pattern of correlated motions within and between the three equivalent subunits involving the PCNA C-terminal region and linker strand associated with partner protein binding sites. Additionally, principal component analysis identified low frequency global PCNA subunit motions suitable for translocation along duplex DNA. The PCNA motions and interactions with the DNA minor groove, identified here computationally, provide an unexpected basis for PCNA to act in the coordinated handoff of intermediates from polymerase to FEN-1 to ligase during DNA replication and repair.",

        "Abstract": "IL-17-producing T lymphocytes have been recently shown to comprise a distinct lineage of proinflammatory T helper cells, termed Th17 cells, that are major contributors to autoimmune disease. We show here that the orphan nuclear receptor RORgammat is the key transcription factor that orchestrates the differentiation of this effector cell lineage. RORgammat induces transcription of the genes encoding IL-17 and the related cytokine IL-17F in naïve CD4(+) T helper cells and is required for their expression in response to IL-6 and TGF-beta, the cytokines known to induce IL-17. Th17 cells are constitutively present throughout the intestinal lamina propria, express RORgammat, and are absent in mice deficient for RORgammat or IL-6. Mice with RORgammat-deficient T cells have attenuated autoimmune disease and lack tissue-infiltrating Th17 cells. Together, these studies suggest that RORgammat is a key regulator of immune homeostasis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases.",

        "Abstract": "cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) is a key transcription factor in the differentiation of round spermatids into mature spermatozoa. During spermiogenesis, CREM is regulated in part by activator of CREM in the testis (ACT), which activates CREM in a phosphorylation-independent fashion. We hypothesized that the ACT gene, which is expressed exclusively in the testis, could be involved in male factor infertility in patients with idiopathic-impaired spermatogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the coding regions and flanking intronic regions of the ACT gene in 96 azoo- or oligospermic patients and 69 fertile controls. A total of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was identified, and four of them leading to amino acid substitutions. An association study was performed based on calculated haplotype frequencies, and statistically significant differences were found between the patient and control populations for some haplotypes. To help establish the evolutionary relationships between the haplotypes, the coding regions of both the chimpanzee and the gorilla ACT gene were sequenced and evaluated. To test whether the different haplotypes conferred a functional change to the ACT protein, a yeast two-hybrid assay was designed to test the interaction between the two most divergent ACT haplotypes and their known binding partners, CREM and KIF17b. We identified one ACT haplotype that had a 45% reduction in its interaction with CREM. Our results suggest that different haplotypes within the ACT gene may contribute to male factor subfertility.",

A strong link has been established between these functions and the conformation that the polymers adopt in solution and at lipid bilayer interfaces. Thus, it is imperative for molecular dynamics simulations designed to probe the conformational behavior of these systems to accurately describe the torsional degrees of freedom. Standard force fields were shown to be deficient in this respect. Therefore, we have computed the relevant torsional energy profiles using a series of constrained geometry optimizations. We have also determined electrostatic parameters using our results in combination with standard RESP charge optimization. Force constants for bond and angle potentials were calculated by iteratively matching quantum and classical normal modes via a Monte Carlo scheme. The resulting new set of parameters accurately described the conformation and dynamical behavior of the arylamide polymers.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate calculation of pK(a) values and free energies for acid/base reactions in the condensed phase has been a long-standing goal of theoretical chemistry. We present a novel application of the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics method to the problem of relative pK(a) determination. As a particular example, we focus on the second stage in the dissociation of histidine, a process that holds special importance for biology. Using constrained molecular dynamics, we have analyzed the structural, electronic, and dynamical transformations taking place along a preselected, intuitive reaction coordinate. By integrating the potentials of mean force for the deprotonation of histidine and for a reference reaction, autodissociation of water, we obtain a pK(a) value of 6.8, which appears to be in good agreement with the experimental estimate of 6.1. Detailed analysis was undertaken to determine the value of the constraint, which transformed the N*-H* from a covalent to a hydrogen bond. This helped to identify a number of properties that could be successfully used in monitoring the dissociation process. Additional analysis in terms of electron localization functions provided valuable insight into the nature of the deprotonation reaction.",

Specifically, we have developed new torsional parameters for a class of these polymers and applied them in a study of the interaction between a representative arylamide and one of its biomedical targets, the anticoagulant drug heparin. Our main finding is that the torsional barrier of a C(aromatic)-C(carbonyl) bond increases significantly upon addition of an o-OCH2CH2NH3+ substituent on the benzene ring. Our molecular dynamics studies that are based on the original general AMBER force field (GAFF) and GAFF modified to include our newly developed torsional parameters show that the binding mechanism between the arylamide and heparin is very sensitive to the choice of torsional potentials. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation of the arylamide independently confirms the degree of flexibility we obtain by classical molecular dynamics when newly developed torsional potentials are used.",

        "Abstract": "We have applied molecular dynamics to investigate the structural properties and activity of recently synthesized amphiphilic polymethacrylate derivatives, designed to mimic the antimicrobial activity of natural peptides. The composition, molecular weight, and hydrophobicity (ratio of hydrophobic and cationic units) of these short copolymers can be modulated to achieve structural diversity, which is crucial in controlling the antimicrobial activity. We have carried out all-atom molecular dynamics to systematically investigate the conformations adopted by these copolymers in water and at the water-lipid interface as a function of sequence and the chemical nature of the monomers. For two sequences, we observe partial insertion into the bilayer. Formation of strong interactions between the lipid headgroups and the amine groups of the polymers assists in the initial association with the lipids. However, the primary driving force for the observed partial insertion appears to be the hydrophobic effect. Our results indicate sensitive dependence of the overall shape on the sequence, suggesting that experimentally observed changes in activity can be correlated with particular sequences, providing an avenue for rational design.",

        "Abstract": "An autoregulatory translational shift to the +1 frame is required for the expression of ornithine decarboxylase antizyme from fungi to mammals. In most eukaryotes, including all vertebrates and a majority of the studied fungi/yeast, the site on antizyme mRNA where the shift occurs is UCC-UGA. The mechanism of the frameshift on this sequence likely involves nearly universal aspects of the eukaryotic translational machinery. Nevertheless, a mammalian antizyme frameshift cassette yields predominantly -2 frameshift in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, instead of the +1 in mammals. The recently identified endogenous S. cerevisiae antizyme mRNA has an atypical shift site: UGC-GCG-UGA. It is shown here that endogenous S. cerevisiae antizyme frameshifting is +1 rather than -2. We discuss how antizyme frameshifting in budding yeasts exploits peculiarities of their tRNA balance, and relate this to prior studies on Ty frameshifting.",

        "Abstract": "A recently identified gene, hclA (synonym: ort), codes for an ionotrophic histamine receptor subunit in Drosophila melanogaster, and known hclA mutations lead to defects in the visual system, neurologic disorders and changed responsiveness to neurotoxins. To investigate whether this novel class of receptors is common across the Insecta, we analysed the genomes of 15 other insect species (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera) and revealed orthologs of hclA in all of them. The predicted receptor domain of HCLA is extensively conserved (86-100% of identity) among the 16 proteins. Minor changes in the amino acid sequence that includes the putative transmembrane domains (TMs) 1-3 were found in non-drosophilid species only. Substantial amino acid variability was observed in the signal polypeptides, the intracellular loop domains and in TM4, in good accordance with known data on sequence variations in ligand-gated ion channels. Pairwise comparisons revealed three consensus sequences for N-glycosylation, conserved in HCLAs of all species studied, as well as a drosophilid-specific putative phosphorylation site. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that hclA-mRNA is abundant in heads of adult Drosophila. However, species- and sex-specific variations of the hclA expression levels were also observed.",

        "Abstract": "To test the contribution of individual D gene segments to B cell development and function, we used gene targeting to create mice that contain only DFL16.1 in the DH locus. We term this D-limited IgH allele DeltaD-DFL. Although the absolute number of IgM+IgD- B cells in the bone marrow was decreased, homozygous DeltaD-DFL BALB/c mice contained normal numbers of IgM+IgD+ B cells in bone marrow and spleen and normal numbers of B1a, B1b, and B2 cells in the peritoneal cavity. Bone marrow IgM+IgD+ B cells express a CDR-H3 repertoire similar in length and amino acid composition to the DFL16.1 subset of the wild-type BALB/c repertoire but divergent from sequences that do not contain DFL16.1. This similarity in content is the product of both germline bias and somatic selection, especially in the transition to the mature IgM+IgD+ stage of development. Serum Ig concentrations and the humoral immune response to a T-dependent Ag ([4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl]acetyl hapten) were nearly identical to wild-type littermate controls. A greater variance in the immune response to the T-independent Ag (alpha(1-->3)-dextran) was observed in DeltaD-DFL homozygotes, with half of the mice exhibiting levels below the range exhibited by controls. Although limited to a repertoire specific to DFL16.1, the presence of a single DH gene segment of normal sequence was sufficient for development of normal numbers of mature B cells and for robust humoral immune function.",

        "Title": "Development of the expressed Ig CDR-H3 repertoire is marked by focusing of constraints in length, amino acid use, and charge that are first established in early B cell progenitors.",
        "Abstract": "To gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate the development of the H chain CDR3 (CDR-H3), we used the scheme of Hardy to sort mouse bone marrow B lineage cells into progenitor, immature, and mature B cell fractions, and then performed sequence analysis on V(H)7183-containing Cmu transcripts. The essential architecture of the CDR-H3 repertoire observed in the mature B cell fraction F was already established in the early pre-B cell fraction C. These architectural features include V(H) gene segment use preference, D(H) family usage, J(H) rank order, predicted structures of the CDR-H3 base and loop, and the amino acid composition and average hydrophobicity of the CDR-H3 loop. With development, the repertoire was focused by eliminating outliers to what appears to be a preferred repertoire in terms of length, amino acid composition, and average hydrophobicity. Unlike humans, the average length of CDR-H3 increased during development. The majority of this increase came from enhanced preservation of J(H) sequence. This was associated with an increase in the prevalence of tyrosine. With an accompanying increase in glycine, a shift in hydrophobicity was observed in the CDR-H3 loop from near neutral in fraction C (-0.08 +/- 0.03) to mild hydrophilic in fraction F (-0.17 +/- 0.02). Fundamental constraints on the sequence and structure of CDR-H3 are thus established before surface IgM expression.",

        "Abstract": "We have used ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) to investigate the dynamical flexibility of the bridged binuclear structural motif in the active site of arginase. Dynamical transformations play a crucial role in catalysis. We have provided direct insight into the motions of the first-shell ligands with emphasis on the chelating and bridging carboxylates. In the case of the terminal Asp234 residue we observe changes in the binding mode (carboxylate shifts). AIMD dynamics of sufficient duration has allowed us to observe proton transfer from the bridging nucleophile to the catalytically essential Asp 128 residue and to map the underlying free energy surface in terms of simple reaction coordinates, such as the oxygen-oxygen distance Ro-o and the asymmetric stretch delta. This has provided valuable insight into the nature of the last step of the catalytic cycle. In addition, constrained molecular dynamics permitted us to compare the deprotonation free energy of the bridging nucleophile in the case of native versus metal-depleted arginase.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular dynamics results are presented for a coarse-grain model of 1,2-di-n-alkanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, water, and a capped cylindrical model of a transmembrane peptide. We first demonstrate that different alkanoyl-length lipids are miscible in the liquid-disordered lamellar (Lalpha) phase. The transmembrane peptide is constructed of hydrophobic sites with hydrophilic caps. The hydrophobic length of the peptide is smaller than the hydrophobic thickness of a bilayer consisting of an equal mixture of long and short alkanoyl tail lipids. When incorporated into the membrane, a meniscus forms in the vicinity of the peptide and the surrounding area is enriched in the short lipid. The meniscus region draws water into it. In the regions that are depleted of water, the bilayers can fuse. The lipid headgroups then rearrange to solvate the newly formed water pores, resulting in an inverted phase. This mechanism appears to be a viable pathway for the experimentally observed Lalpha-to-inverse hexagonal (HII) peptide-induced phase transition.",

The frameshift in decoding most vertebrate antizyme mRNAs is stimulated by an RNA pseudoknot 3' of the frameshift site. Although the frameshifting event itself is conserved in a wide variety of organisms from yeast to mammals, until recently no corresponding 3' RNA pseudoknot was known in invertebrate antizyme mRNAs. A pseudoknot, different in structure and origin from its vertebrate counterparts, is now shown to be encoded by the antizyme genes of distantly related invertebrates. Identification of the 3' frameshifting stimulator in intermediate species or other invertebrates remains unresolved.",

        "Abstract": "Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) methods were used to investigate the structural features of the active site of the binuclear enzyme rat liver arginase. Special emphasis was placed on the crucial role of the second shell ligand interactions. These interactions were systematically studied by performing calculations on models of varying size. It was determined that a water molecule, and not hydroxide, is the bridging exogenous ligand. The carboxylate ligands facilitate the close approach of the Mn (II) ions by attenuating the metal-metal electrostatic repulsion. Of the two metals, Mn(A) was shown to carry a larger positive charge. Analysis of the electronic properties of the active site revealed that orbitals involving the terminal Asp234 residue, as well as the flexible micro-1,1 bridging Asp232, lie at high energies, suggesting weaker coordination. This is reflected in certain structural variability present in our models and is also consistent with recent experimental findings. Finally, implications of our findings for the biological function of the enzyme are delineated.",

To prevent sporadic formation of SD-like sequences the content of G in the randomized region was restricted to 3% only. The two libraries were transformed in Escherichia coli cells and screened for chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance. More than 50 clones capable of tolerating Cm concentrations from 50 micro g/ml to more than 800 micro g/ml were selected. With few exceptions only, the non-SD sequences found in the Cm-resistant clones did not show any significant homology with other known non-SD initiators or enhancers of translation. Statistical (chi(2)) analysis of the distribution of nucleotides in the new non-SD translational initiators showed a different pattern from that of the conventional SD sequences. In few of the clones the yield of CAT exceeded that of the referent (SD-containing) construct. The most productive clones carried the decanucleotides ATTTACCTCC, CCAATCTAC, TTCAATATTT, and TATTCCCCCA, and the corresponding yield of CAT obtained with them was 2.70, 2.06, 2.12 and 1.32 times, respectively, higher than that of the SD-bearing construct.",

        "Title": "Maintenance of the correct open reading frame by the ribosome.",
        "Abstract": "During translation, a string of non-overlapping triplet codons in messenger RNA is decoded into protein. The ability of a ribosome to decode mRNA without shifting between reading frames is a strict requirement for accurate protein biosynthesis. Despite enormous progress in understanding the mechanism of transfer RNA selection, the mechanism by which the correct reading frame is maintained remains unclear. In this report, evidence is presented that supports the idea that the translational frame is controlled mainly by the stability of codon-anticodon interactions at the P site. The relative instability of such interactions may lead to dissociation of the P-site tRNA from its codon, and formation of a complex with an overlapping codon, the process known as P-site tRNA slippage. We propose that this process is central to all known cases of +1 ribosomal frameshifting, including that required for the decoding of the yeast transposable element Ty3. An earlier model for the decoding of this element proposed 'out-of-frame' binding of A-site tRNA without preceding P-site tRNA slippage.",

        "Abstract": "The dissociation of a weak acid - a histidine residue - in water was investigated by means of constrained Car-Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics. Both linear and coordination constraints were employed, and the structural, electronic, and dynamical transformations along the respective reaction coordinates were analyzed. The calculated potentials of mean force for the dissociation of a hydrogen atom from the Nepsilon and Ndelta positions of the imidazole ring reveal that protonated forms are approximately 9.0-9.5 kcal/mol more stable than the deprotonated. This result seems to agree well with the experimental estimate based on pKa. A possible transition state for the deprotonation has also been identified. Analysis of the electron localization function indicates that the proton transfer along the selected reaction path is not a fully concerted process.",

        "Abstract": "In an effort to identify potential programmed frameshift sites by statistical analysis, we explore the hypothesis that selective pressure would have rendered such sites underabundant and underrepresented in protein-coding sequences. We developed a computer program to compare the frequencies of k-length subsequences of nucleotides with the frequencies predicted by a zero order Markov chain determined by the codon bias of the same set of sequences. The program was used to calculate and evaluate the distribution of 7-base oligonucleotides in the 6000+ putative protein-coding sequences of S. cerevisiae preliminary to the laboratory testing of the most highly underrepresented oligos for frameshifting efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out for aqueous NaOH and KOH solutions under ambient conditions over a wide range of concentrations. From these simulations, we have observed a continuous change of the water structure with added hydroxide, characterized by a significant shift of the second peak of the OO radial distribution functions to shorter distances. At the highest concentration investigated, the normal tetrahedral coordination of pure water is completely missing, a result that is consistent with a recent neutron diffraction experiment. The added hydroxide also gives rise to some unique spectroscopic features, including a \"free\" O-H stretch, a broadening of the normal water OH stretching band, and a large blue shift of both the librational band and the low-frequency translation. These results are in good agreement with the experimental data. Finally, it was demonstrated that the structural and dynamical behavior is inextricably linked to the formation of compact hydroxide-water complexes.",
