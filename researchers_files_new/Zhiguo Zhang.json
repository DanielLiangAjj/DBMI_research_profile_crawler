        "Abstract": "Ischemic stroke is one main type of cerebrovascular disorders with leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Astrocytes are the only nerve cell type storing glycogen in the brain, which regulate the glucose metabolism and handle the energy supply and survive of neurons. Astrocyte ferroptosis contributes to neuron injury in brain disorders. N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) has been implicated in the progression of brain diseases, including ischemic stroke. However, whether NDRG2 could affect the glucose metabolism and ferroptosis of astrocytes during ischemic stroke remains largely unknown. Mouse astrocytes were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to establish the in vitro model. Glial fibrillary acidic protein, NDRG2, Wnt3a and β-catenin expression levels were detected by immunofluorescence staining and western blot analyses. Glucose metabolism was investigated by glucose uptake, lactate production, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH/NADP",

        "Abstract": "Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been used for cancer detection. However, DNA hemi-methylation, present at about 10% CpG dinucleotides, has been less well studied. Here we show that a majority of differentially hemi-methylated regions (DHMRs) in liver tumor DNA or plasma cells free (cf) DNA do not overlap with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the same samples, indicating that DHMRs could serve as independent biomarkers. Furthermore, we analyzed the cfDNA methylomes of 215 samples from individuals with liver or brain cancer and individuals without cancer (controls), and trained machine learning models using DMRs, DHMRs or both. The models incorporated with both DMRs and DHMRs show a superior performance compared to models trained with DMRs or DHMRs, with AUROC being 0.978, 0.990, and 0.983 in distinguishing control, liver and brain cancer, respectively, in a validation cohort. This study supports the potential of utilizing both DMRs and DHMRs for multi-cancer detection.",

        "Title": "Adipose-derived stem cell exosomes loaded with icariin alleviates rheumatoid arthritis by modulating macrophage polarization in rats.",
        "Abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease marked by synovitis and cartilage destruction. The active compound, icariin (ICA), derived from the herb Epimedium, exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, its clinical utility is limited by its water insolubility, poor permeability, and low bioavailability. To address these challenges, we developed a multifunctional drug delivery system-adipose-derived stem cells-exosomes (ADSCs-EXO)-ICA to target active macrophages in synovial tissue and modulate macrophage polarization from M1 to M2. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed a 92.4 ± 0.008% loading efficiency for ADSCs-EXO-ICA. In vitro studies utilizing cellular immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry demonstrated significant inhibition of M1 macrophage proliferation by ADSCs-EXO-ICA. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, cellular transcriptomics, and real-time quantitative PCR indicated that ADSCs-EXO-ICA promotes an M1-to-M2 phenotypic transition by reducing glycolysis through the inhibition of the ERK/HIF-1α/GLUT1 pathway. In vivo, ADSCs-EXO-ICA effectively accumulated in the joints. Pharmacodynamic assessments revealed that ADSCs-EXO-ICA decreased cytokine levels and mitigated arthritis symptoms in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. Histological analysis and micro computed tomography confirmed that ADSCs-EXO-ICA markedly ameliorated synovitis and preserved cartilage. Further in vivo studies indicated that ADSCs-EXO-ICA suppresses arthritis by promoting an M1-to-M2 switch and suppressing glycolysis. Western blotting supported the therapeutic efficacy of ADSCs-EXO-ICA in RA, confirming its role in modulating macrophage function through energy metabolism regulation. Thus, this study not only introduces a drug delivery system that significantly enhances the anti-RA efficacy of ADSCs-EXO-ICA but also elucidates its mechanism of action in macrophage function inhibition.",

        "Abstract": "High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies decode tremendous amounts of microbial protein-coding gene sequences. However, accurately assigning protein functions to novel gene sequences remain a challenge. To this end, we developed FunGeneTyper, an extensible framework with two new deep learning models (i.e., FunTrans and FunRep), structured databases, and supporting resources for achieving highly accurate (Accuracy > 0.99, F1-score > 0.97) and fine-grained classification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factor genes. Using an experimentally confirmed dataset of ARGs comprising remote homologous sequences as the test set, our framework achieves by-far-the-best performance in the discovery of new ARGs from human gut (F1-score: 0.6948), wastewater (0.6072), and soil (0.5445) microbiomes, beating the state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools and sequence alignment-based (F1-score: 0.0556-0.5065) and domain-based (F1-score: 0.2630-0.5224) annotation approaches. Furthermore, our framework is implemented as a lightweight, privacy-preserving, and plug-and-play neural network module, facilitating its versatility and accessibility to developers and users worldwide. We anticipate widespread utilization of FunGeneTyper (https://github.com/emblab-westlake/FunGeneTyper) for precise classification of protein-coding gene functions and the discovery of numerous valuable enzymes. This advancement will have a significant impact on various fields, including microbiome research, biotechnology, metagenomics, and bioinformatics.",

        "Abstract": "Abnormal macrophage polarization is one of the common pathological bases of various inflammatory diseases. The current research focus involves targeting macrophages to remodel their phenotype as a treatment approach for inflammatory diseases. Notably, exosomes can be delivered to specific types of cells or tissues or inflammatory area to realize targeted drug delivery. Although icariin (ICA) exhibits regulatory potential in macrophage polarization, the practical application of ICA is impeded by its water insolubility, poor permeability, and low bioavailability. Exploiting the inherent advantages of exosomes as natural drug carriers, we introduce a novel drug delivery system-adipose-derived stem cells-exosomes (ADSCs-EXO)-ICA. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed a loading rate of 92.7 ± 0.01 % for ADSCs-EXO-ICA, indicating the successful incorporation of ICA. As demonstrated by cell counting kit-8 assays, ADSCs-EXO exerted a significantly higher promotion effect on macrophage proliferation. The subsequent experimental results revealed the superior anti-inflammatory effect of ADSCs-EXO-ICA compared to individual treatments with EXO or ICA in the lipopolysaccharide + interferon-gamma-induced M1 inflammation model. Additionally, results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analyses revealed that ADSCs-EXO-ICA effectively inhibited macrophage polarization toward the M1-type and concurrently promoted polarization toward the M2-type. The underlying mechanism involved the modulation of macrophage polarization through inhibition of the Toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation factor 88/nuclear transcription factor-kappa B signaling pathway, thereby mitigating inflammation. These findings underscore the potential therapeutic value of ADSCs-EXO-ICA as a novel intervention for inflammatory diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Inheritance of epigenetic information is critical for maintaining cell identity. The transfer of parental histone H3-H4 tetramers, the primary carrier of epigenetic modifications on histone proteins, represents a crucial yet poorly understood step in the inheritance of epigenetic information. Here, we show the lagging strand DNA polymerase, Pol δ, interacts directly with H3-H4 and that the interaction between Pol δ and the sliding clamp PCNA regulates parental histone transfer to lagging strands, most likely independent of their roles in DNA synthesis. When combined, mutations at Pol δ and Mcm2 that compromise parental histone transfer result in a greater reduction in nucleosome occupancy at nascent chromatin than mutations in either alone. Last, PCNA contributes to nucleosome positioning on nascent chromatin. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the PCNA-Pol δ complex couples lagging strand DNA synthesis to parental H3-H4 transfer, facilitating epigenetic inheritance.",

        "Title": "Multimodal and hemispheric graph-theoretical brain network predictors of learning efficacy for frontal alpha asymmetry neurofeedback.",
        "Abstract": "EEG neurofeedback using frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) has been widely used for emotion regulation, but its effectiveness is controversial. Studies indicated that individual differences in neurofeedback training can be traced to neuroanatomical and neurofunctional features. However, they only focused on regional brain structure or function and overlooked possible neural correlates of the brain network. Besides, no neuroimaging predictors for FAA neurofeedback protocol have been reported so far. We designed a single-blind pseudo-controlled FAA neurofeedback experiment and collected multimodal neuroimaging data from healthy participants before training. We assessed the learning performance for evoked EEG modulations during training (L1) and at rest (L2), and investigated performance-related predictors based on a combined analysis of multimodal brain networks and graph-theoretical features. The main findings of this study are described below. First, both real and sham groups could increase their FAA during training, but only the real group showed a significant increase in FAA at rest. Second, the predictors during training blocks and at rests were different: L1 was correlated with the graph-theoretical metrics (clustering coefficient and local efficiency) of the right hemispheric gray matter and functional networks, while L2 was correlated with the graph-theoretical metrics (local and global efficiency) of the whole-brain and left the hemispheric functional network. Therefore, the individual differences in FAA neurofeedback learning could be explained by individual variations in structural/functional architecture, and the correlated graph-theoretical metrics of learning performance indices showed different laterality of hemispheric networks. These results provided insight into the neural correlates of inter-individual differences in neurofeedback learning.",

        "Abstract": "The intricate relationship between prestimulus alpha oscillations and visual contrast detection variability has been the focus of numerous studies. However, the causal impact of prestimulus alpha traveling waves on visual contrast detection remains largely unexplored. In our research, we sought to discern the causal link between prestimulus alpha traveling waves and visual contrast detection across different levels of mental fatigue. Using electroencephalography alongside a visual detection task with 30 healthy adults (13 females; 17 males), we identified a robust negative correlation between prestimulus alpha forward traveling waves (FTWs) and visual contrast threshold (VCT). Inspired by this correlation, we utilized 45/-45° phase-shifted transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in a sham-controlled, double-blind, within-subject experiment with 33 healthy adults (23 females; 10 males) to directly modulate these alpha traveling waves. After the application of 45° phase-shifted tACS, we observed a substantial decrease in FTW and an increase in backward traveling waves, along with a concurrent increase in VCT, compared with the sham condition. These changes were particularly pronounced under a low fatigue state. The findings of state-dependent tACS effects reveal the potential causal role of prestimulus alpha traveling waves in visual contrast detection. Moreover, our study highlights the potential of 45/-45° phase-shifted tACS in cognitive modulation and therapeutic applications.",

        "Abstract": "The presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soils has received extensive attention regarding its impacts on environmental, animal, and human systems under One Health. However, the health risks of soil ARGs and microbial determinants of soil resistomes remain poorly understood. Here, a nationwide metagenomic investigation of ARGs in cropland and forest soils in China was conducted. The findings indicated that the abundance and richness of high-risk (i.e., mobilizable, pathogen-carriable and clinically relevant) ARGs in cropland soils were 25.7 times and 8.4 times higher, respectively, compared to those identified in forest soils, suggesting the contribution of agricultural practices to the elevated risk level of soil resistomes. The biosynthetic potential of antibacterials best explained the total ARG abundance (Mantel's r = 0.52, p < 0.001) when compared with environmental variables and anthropogenic disturbance. Both microbial producers' self-resistance and antagonistic interactions contributed to the ARG abundance, of which self-resistance ARGs account for 14.1 %- 35.1 % in abundance. With the increased biosynthetic potential of antibacterials, the antagonistic interactions within the microbial community were greatly enhanced, leading to a significant increase in ARG abundance. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of the emergence and dissemination of soil ARGs and provide critical implications for the risk control of soil resistomes.",

        "Abstract": "High-grade gliomas (HGG) are deadly diseases for both adult and pediatric patients. Recently, it has been shown that neuronal activity promotes progression of multiple subgroups of HGG. However, epigenetic mechanisms that govern this process remain elusive. Here we report that the chromatin remodeler CHD2 regulates neuron-glioma interactions in diffuse midline glioma (DMG) characterized by onco-histone H3.1K27M. Depletion of CHD2 in H3.1K27M DMG cells compromises cell viability and neuron-to-glioma synaptic connections in vitro, neuron-induced proliferation of H3.1K27M DMG cells in vitro and in vivo, activity-dependent calcium transients in vivo, and extends the survival of H3.1K27M DMG-bearing mice. Mechanistically, CHD2 coordinates with the transcription factor FOSL1 to control the expression of axon-guidance and synaptic genes in H3.1K27M DMG cells. Together, our study reveals a mechanism whereby CHD2 controls the intrinsic gene program of the H3.1K27M DMG subtype, which in turn regulates the tumor growth-promoting interactions of glioma cells with neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Probe-based confocal laser endoscopy (pCLE) has emerged as a powerful tool for disease diagnosis, yet it faces challenges such as the formation of hexagonal patterns in images due to the inherent characteristics of fiber bundles. Recent advancements in deep learning offer promise in image denoising, but the acquisition of clean-noisy image pairs for training networks across all potential scenarios can be prohibitively costly. Few studies have explored training denoising networks on such pairs. Here, we propose an innovative self-supervised denoising method. Our approach integrates noise prediction networks, image quality assessment networks, and denoising networks in a collaborative, jointly trained manner. Compared to prior self-supervised denoising methods, our approach yields superior results on pCLE images and fluorescence microscopy images. In summary, our novel self-supervised denoising technique enhances image quality in pCLE diagnosis by leveraging the synergy of noise prediction, image quality assessment, and denoising networks, surpassing previous methods on both pCLE and fluorescence microscopy images.",

        "Abstract": "Bacterial secondary metabolites serve as an important source of molecules for drug discovery. They also play an important function in mediating the interactions of microbial producers with their living environment and surrounding organisms. However, little is known about the genetic novelty, distribution, and community-level impacts of soil bacterial biosynthetic potential on a large geographic scale. Here, we constructed the first catalog of 11,149 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from agricultural soils across China and unearthed hidden biosynthetic potential for new natural product discovery from the not-yet-cultivated soil bacteria. Notably, we revealed soil pH as the strongest environmental driver of BGC biogeography and predicted that soil acidification and global climate change could damage the biosynthetic potential of the soil microbiome. The co-occurrence network of bacterial genomes revealed two BGC-rich species, i.e., ",

Bilateral oophorectomy was used to establish an OVX menopausal model. Four groups of rats were randomly selected: Sham surgery group, OVX group, estradiol (0.018g/L) and GZLM group (20g/kg). Cardiac function was assessed using ultrasound, blood pressure was measured using the tail cuff method. The oxidase method was used to determine the total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides in serum. Direct measurement of high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein levels (LDL-C). Hematoxylin eosin staining and electron microscopy examination of myocardial structure. Microscopic CT was used to determine the bone microstructure. GZLM improved pathological cardiac changes and reduced the LVIDs, LVVols and LVVold. There was a decrease in systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and mean blood pressure in GZLM group. A decrease in serum TC and LDL-C levels was observed in the GZLM group. The BMD, BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N of GZLM group raised, while Tb.SP and SMI significantly decreased or decreased. GZLM may have the effect of improving abnormal cardiac structure and function, promoting bone metabolism in OVX rats.",

        "Abstract": "Impairments in working memory (WM) are evident in both clinically diagnosed patients with mild cognitive decline and older adults at risk, as indicated by lower scores on neuropsychological tests. Examining the WM-related neural signatures in at-risk older adults becomes essential for timely intervention. WM functioning relies on dynamic brain activities, particularly within the frontoparietal system. However, it remains unclear whether the cognitive decline would be reflected in the decreased dynamic reconfiguration of brain coactivation states during WM tasks. We enrolled 47 older adults and assessed their cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The temporal dynamics of brain coactivations during a WM task were investigated through graph-based time-frame modularity analysis. Four primary recurring states emerged: two task-positive states with positive activity in the frontoparietal system (dorsal attention and central executive); two task-negative states with positive activity in the default mode network accompanied by negative activity in the frontoparietal networks. Heightened WM load was associated with increased flexibility of the frontoparietal networks, but the cognitive decline was correlated with reduced capacity for neuroplastic changes in response to increased task demands. These findings advance our understanding of aberrant brain reconfiguration linked to cognitive decline, potentially aiding early identification of at-risk individuals.",

PVAT is a specific type of adipose tissue that wraps around blood vessels and has recently emerged as a critical factor for maintenance of vascular health. Through a profound exploration of existing research, this review sheds light on the intricate structural composition and cellular origins of PVAT, with a particular emphasis on combining its regulatory functions for vascular tone, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function. The review then delves into the intricate mechanisms by which PVAT exerts its protective effects, including the secretion of diverse adipokines and manipulation of the renin-angiotensin complex. The review further examines the alterations in PVAT function and phenotype observed in several cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart failure. Recognizing the complex interactions of PVAT with the cardiovascular system is critical for pursuing breakthrough therapeutic strategies that can target cardiovascular disease. Therefore, this review aims to augment present understanding of the protective role of PVAT in cardiovascular health, with a special emphasis on elucidating potential mechanisms and paving the way for future research directions in this evolving field.",

        "Abstract": "Rapid and cost-efficient antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) is key to timely prescription-oriented diagnosis and precision treatment. However, current AST methods have limitations in throughput or cost effectiveness, and are impractical for microbial communities. Here, we developed a high-throughput micro-well array-based colorimetric AST (macAST) system equipped with a self-developed smartphone application that could efficiently test sixteen combinations of bacteria strains and antibiotics, achieving comparable AST results based on resazurin metabolism assay. For community samples, we integrated immunomagnetic separation into the macAST (imacAST) system to specifically enrich the target cells before testing, which shortened bacterial isolation time from days to only 45 min and achieved AST of the target bacteria with a low concentration (~10",

        "Abstract": "The YOLOv4 approach has gained significant popularity in industrial object detection due to its impressive real-time processing speed and relatively favorable accuracy. However, it has been observed that YOLOv4 faces challenges in accurately detecting small objects. Its bounding box regression strategy is rigid and fails to effectively leverage the asymmetric characteristics of objects, limiting its ability to enhance object detection accuracy. This paper proposes an enhanced version of YOLOv4 called KR-AL-YOLO (keypoint regression strategy and angle loss based YOLOv4). The KR-AL-YOLO approach introduces two customized modules: an keypoint regression strategy and an angle-loss function. These modules contribute to improving the algorithm's detection accuracy by enabling more precise localization of objects. Additionally, KR-AL-YOLO adopts an improved feature fusion technique, which facilitates enhanced information flow within the network, thereby further enhancing accuracy performance. Experimental evaluations conducted on the COCO2017 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. KR-AL-YOLO achieves an average precision of 45.6%, surpassing both YOLOv4 and certain previously developed one-stage detectors. The utilization of keypoint regression strategy and the incorporation of robust feature fusion contribute to superior object detection accuracy in KR-AL-YOLO compared to YOLOv4.",

        "Abstract": "Oryza coarctata (2n = 4X = 48, KKLL) is an allotetraploid, undomesticated relative of rice and the only species in the genus Oryza with tolerance to high salinity and submergence. Therefore, it contains important stress and tolerance genes/factors for rice. The initial draft genome published was limited by data and technical restrictions, leading to an incomplete and highly fragmented assembly. This study reports a new, highly contiguous chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation of O. coarctata. PacBio high-quality HiFi reads generated 460 contigs with a total length of 573.4 Mb and an N50 of 23.1 Mb, which were assembled into scaffolds with Hi-C data, anchoring 96.99% of the assembly onto 24 chromosomes. The genome assembly comprises 45,571 genes, and repetitive content contributes 25.5% of the genome. This study provides the novel identification of the KK and LL genome types of the genus Oryza, leading to valuable insights into rice genome evolution. The chromosome-level genome assembly of O. coarctata is a valuable resource for rice research and molecular breeding.",

        "Abstract": "Evidence of presolidification, the counterpart to premelting, is reported. Near the eutectic temperature, T_{C}, the propagation direction of thermal gradient driven motion of eutectic Ge-Pt droplets on Ge(110) is determined by presolidification. Well above T_{C}, the micron-sized droplets move towards the hottest location at the substrate, irrespective of crystalline direction. At 90 K above T_{C}, a strong, unanticipated preference for propagation along the substrate [001] azimuth suddenly emerges, which is attributed to presolidification at the liquid-solid interface. The propagation along [001] is accompanied by a distinct change in shape from compact to elongated along [001].",

        "Abstract": "Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a bioactive substance with anti-inflammatory activities. Clusters of CD36 have been suggested to be widely involved in inflammatory damage. However, the mechanism of CGA protecting against LPS-induced inflammation involving the CD36 regulation is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that CGA protected against LPS-induced cell death and decreased the production of ROS. Moreover, the SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities were also upregulated in CGA-treated cells during LPS stimulation. CGA reduced COX-2 and iNOS expression and IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α secretion in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. In addition, CGA treatment widely involved in immune-related signaling pathways, including NF-κB signaling, NOD-like receptor signaling, and IL-17 signaling using transcriptomic analysis and CD36 also markedly reduced during CGA pretreatment in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, the CD36 inhibitor SSO attenuated inflammation and oxidative stress by enabling activation of the AMPK/PGC-1α cascade. These results indicate that CGA might provide benefits for the regulation of inflammatory diseases by modulating CD36/AMPK/PGC-1α to alleviate oxidative stress.",

        "Abstract": "Optical tweezers exert a strong trapping force on cells, making it crucial to analyze the movement of trapped cells. The rotation of cells plays a significant role in their swimming patterns, such as in sperm cells. We proposed a fast deep-learning-based method that can automatically determine the projection orientation of ellipsoidal-like cells without additional optical design. This method was utilized for analyzing the planar rotation of trapped sperm cells using an optical tweezer, demonstrating its feasibility in extracting the rotation of the cell head. Furthermore, we employed this method to investigate sperm cell activity by examining variations in sperm rotation rates under different conditions, including temperature and laser output power. Our findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of this method and the rotation analysis method developed may have clinical potential for sperm quality evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous studies of perceptual decision-making have shown that lower prestimulus alpha power leads to a higher hit rate in visual detection, which is believed to correlate with the top-down control. However, whether frontal-occipital phase synchronization underlying the top-down control could impact the occipital alpha power that directly affects the perceptual performance remains unclear. In this study, we used analyses of the general linear mixed model (GLMM) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to show that the prestimulus alpha power over the occipital area directly affected visual perception. Using both the univariate and multivariate methods, we found that low-frequency (4-30 Hz) frontal-occipital phase synchronization predicted the prestimulus alpha power over the occipital area. Overall, our results suggested that frontal-occipital phase synchronization could predict occipital alpha power that directly affects perceptual decision-making.",

People from countries without a well-developed health safety-net are particularly vulnerable. Existing literature on rare diseases in China focuses on the unmet needs for care of the patients and the difficulties of caregivers and physicians. Very few studies examine the state of social safety-net, the unresolved issues and whether the current localized arrangements are sufficient. This study aimed to gain in-depth knowledge of the current policy system and make sense of the local varieties, which would be essential for developing strategies for future policy changes.",

        "Abstract": "The link between fatty acids and bone metabolism is complex and can be direct and indirect. This link has been reported in different types of bone cells and various stages of bone metabolism. G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), also called free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4), is a member of the recently discovered G protein-coupled receptor family that can interact with both long-chain saturated fatty acids (C14-C18) and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (C16-C22). Research shows that GPR120 regulates processes in different types of bone cells, directly or indirectly affecting bone metabolism. Our research reviewed the literature on the effects of GPR120 on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs), osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes, focusing on the research findings regarding the mechanism by which GPR120 alters specific bone metabolic diseases-osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. The data reviewed here provide a basis for clinical and basic research into the role of GPR120 on bone metabolic diseases.",

Traditionally, the metal-mediated cyclopropanation domino reaction of chain enzymes is the most commonly used strategy for the construction of this type of aza[3.1.0]bicycle derivative. In this study, a base-promoted intramolecular addition of alkenes used to deliver conformationally restricted highly substituted aza[3.1.0]bicycles is reported. This reaction was tailor-made for saturated aza[3.1.0] bicycle-containing fused bicyclic compounds that may be applied in the development of concise and divergent total syntheses of bioactive compounds.",

However, they are limited by their photostability and have been less explored for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) applications. Herein we demonstrate a novel strategy to cover the shortage of aryl-ketone photocatalysts and control the photoreactivity by implanting symmetric aryl ketones into the conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs). To prove the concept, three comparative materials with the same topology and varied electronic structures were built, adopting truxenone knot and functionalized terephthalaldehyde linkers. Spectroscopic investigation and excited carrier dynamics analysis disclosed improvements in the photostability and electronic transfer efficiency as well as the structure-performance relationships toward ",

        "Abstract": "Aquaporin-8(AQP8), is a transmembrane channel protein that abounds in liver, which mainly promotes water transport, modulating bile acid formation. However, its role in hepatic lipid metabolism remains unclear. In this study, we found the expression of AQP8 was reduced in liver specimens of patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice and genetically obese db/db mice. Knockdown of AQP8 in hepatocytes exacerbated the intracellular lipid accumulation induced by free fatty acid (FFA) mixtures. In contrast, hepatic AQP8 overexpression activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR), inhibiting gene expression associated with lipogenesis, which further reduced intrahepatic triglyceride overload in obese mice. FXR knockout abrogated the ameliorating effect of AQP8 overexpression on NAFLD in mice. These findings indicate that AQP8 overexpression protects against fatty liver through activating the FXR pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Diosgenin (DIO) is an aglycone of steroid saponins acquired from plants, including Dioscorea alata, Smilax China, and Trigonella foenum graecum, acting as an anti-osteoporosis, anti-diabetic, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory. Recent studies have demonstrated that DIO reduces bone loss. This study aimed to investigate the effects of DIO on the gut microbiota (GM) of ovariectomized (OVX) osteoporotic rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham operation (sham + vehicle group) or ovariectomy. For 12 weeks, OVX rats were treated using a vehicle (OVX + vehicle group) and DIO (OVX + DIO group). Subsequently, ELISA was conducted to determine serum estradiol levels, micro-CT scanning was performed to evaluate bone quality, and feces were collected for metagenomics sequencing to examine the structure and function of GM. Raw reads were filtered to remove chimera sequences. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered in the filtered reads. A Venn diagram analysis was conducted to study the common and unique OTUs in the sham + vehicle, OVX + vehicle, and OVX + DIO groups. LEfSe analysis was conducted to evaluate the specific GM of the three groups. The GM functions were analyzed using the KEGG and CAZy databases. After a 12-week treatment, DIO administration prevented OVX-induced weight gain and increased the estradiol levels. DIO treatment improved the bone microstructure and structural parameters of rat tibias. Metagenomics sequencing results identified 1139, 1207, and 1235 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the sham + vehicle, OVX + vehicle, and OVX + DIO groups, respectively. The percentage of common OTUs was 41.2%. Treatment with DIO restored the composition of GM in OVX rats by increasing the abundance of Coriobacteriia Adlercreutzia, Romboutsia, and Romboutsia_idealis and reducing the abundance of Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Methanobacteria, Bacteroides, Phocaeicola, Alistipes, Bacteroids_uniformis, Bacteroids_xylanisolvens. The anti-osteoporosis effect of DIO can be regulated through environmental information processing, organismal Systems, Cellular Processes, human diseases, metabolism, and genetic information processing. Meanwhile, treatment with DIO improved GM homeostasis by increasing the metabolism of carbohydrates, other amino acids, and glycans and reducing translation, energy metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. DIO can reduce bone loss by regulating the structural composition and function of GM, a novel strategy for preventing osteoporosis.",

        "Abstract": "Individual pain sensitivity is modulated by the brain's structural and functional features, but its heritability remains unclear. This paper conducted a brain-wide genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore the genetic bases of neuroimage phenotypes of pain sensitivity. In total, 432 normal participants were divided into high and low pain sensitivity groups according to the laser quantitative test threshold. Then, the brain's gray matter density (GMD) features correlated with pain sensitivity were identified. Next, GWAS was performed on each GMD phenotype using quality-controlled genotypes. Based on the heatmap and hierarchical clustering results, the right insula was identified for further refined analysis in terms of subregions GMD and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) phenotypes. The results indicate that the right insula GMD in the high sensitivity group is significantly lower than that in the low sensitivity group. Also, the TT/TC group at locus rs187974 has lower right insula GMD than the CC group. Further, loci at gene CYP2D6 may lead to a variation of rs-FC between the right insula and left putamen. In conclusion, our study suggests that the right insula and multiple candidate loci may be importantly involved in pain sensitivity modulation, which may guide the future development of precision pain therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the most common causes of heart failure. Therefore, screening and early diagnosis of potential DCM patients is beneficial. Electrocardiogram (ECG) can be an inexpensive and easily available screening tool. We aimed to construct a simple screening model for DCM based on electrocardiogram. In this retrospective observational study, we consecutively enrolled 117 DCM patients between July 1, 2016 and July 1, 2021 as the DCM group, while 117 patients hospitalized in the same period with normal echocardiography and ECG were selected as the non-DCM group. Patients were randomly assigned to the training and validation sets at 8:2. ECG parameters of left ventricular related leads were exacted. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate screening indicators of ECG parameters and a nomogram was conducted. The screening ability of the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Furthermore, the nomogram was assessed using calibration curve and decision curve analysis. Screening indicators included in the nomogram were the amplitude of S wave in V1 and V3 leads, the amplitude of R wave in aVF and V6 leads, and PR interval. The nomogram performed satisfactory discrimination in the training (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.904) and validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.878) sets and good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = .066). Decision curve analysis demonstrated the model can generate a net benefit of 0.33 when the threshold probability was 0.543. The nomogram based on electrocardiogram is a simple and practical screening tool for potential DCM patients.",

        "Title": "Functional connectivity profiles of the default mode and visual networks reflect temporal accumulative effects of sustained naturalistic emotional experience.",
        "Abstract": "Determining and decoding emotional brain processes under ecologically valid conditions remains a key challenge in affective neuroscience. The current functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) based emotion decoding studies are mainly based on brief and isolated episodes of emotion induction, while sustained emotional experience in naturalistic environments that mirror daily life experiences are scarce. Here we used 12 different 10-minute movie clips as ecologically valid emotion-evoking procedures in n = 52 individuals to explore emotion-specific fMRI functional connectivity (FC) profiles on the whole-brain level at high spatial resolution (432 parcellations including cortical and subcortical structures). Employing machine-learning based decoding and cross validation procedures allowed to investigate FC profiles contributing to classification that can accurately distinguish sustained happiness and sadness and that generalize across subjects, movie clips, and parcellations. Both functional brain network-based and subnetwork-based emotion classification results suggested that emotion manifests as distributed representation of multiple networks, rather than a single functional network or subnetwork. Further, the results showed that the Visual Network (VN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) associated functional networks, especially VN-DMN, exhibited a strong contribution to emotion classification. To further estimate the temporal accumulative effect of naturalistic long-term movie-based video-evoking emotions, we divided the 10-min episode into three stages: early stimulation (1∼200 s), middle stimulation (201∼400 s), and late stimulation (401∼600 s) and examined the emotion classification performance at different stimulation stages. We found that the late stimulation contributes most to the classification (accuracy=85.32%, F1-score=85.62%) compared to early and middle stimulation stages, implying that continuous exposure to emotional stimulation can lead to more intense emotions and further enhance emotion-specific distinguishable representations. The present work demonstrated that sustained happiness and sadness under naturalistic conditions are presented in emotion-specific network profiles and these expressions may play different roles in the generation and modulation of emotions. These findings elucidated the importance of network level adaptations for sustained emotional experiences during naturalistic contexts and open new venues for imaging network level contributions under naturalistic conditions.",

This can greatly reduce the energy consumption in the process of cellulose nanoization, and use it to successfully prepare food packaging films for eliminating odors. We hope that due its simplicity and resource-efficiency, this method will have a widespread influence on currently used (nano) cellulose modification protocols.",

        "Title": "Deduplication Improves Cost-Efficiency and Yields of ",
        "Abstract": "In the last decade, metagenomics has greatly revolutionized the study of microbial communities. However, the presence of artificial duplicate reads raised mainly from the preparation of metagenomic DNA sequencing libraries and their impacts on metagenomic assembly and binning have never been brought to attention. Here, we explicitly investigated the effects of duplicate reads on metagenomic assemblies and binning based on analyses of five groups of representative metagenomes with distinct microbiome complexities. Our results showed that deduplication considerably increased the binning yields (by 3.5% to 80%) for most of the metagenomic data sets examined thanks to the improved contig length and coverage profiling of metagenome-assembled contigs, whereas it slightly decreased the binning yields of metagenomes with low complexity (e.g., human gut metagenomes). Specifically, 411 versus 397, 331 versus 317, 104 versus 88, and 9 versus 5 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered from MEGAHIT assemblies of bioreactor sludge, surface water, lake sediment, and forest soil metagenomes, respectively. Noticeably, deduplication significantly reduced the computational costs of the metagenomic assembly, including the elapsed time (9.0% to 29.9%) and the maximum memory requirement (4.3% to 37.1%). Collectively, we recommend the removal of duplicate reads in metagenomes with high complexity before assembly and binning analyses, for example, the forest soil metagenomes examined in this study. ",

        "Abstract": "The collective oscillation of free electrons at the nanoscale surface of gold nanostructures is closely modulated by tuning the size, shape/morphology, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning, along with the surroundings of the plasmonic surface located at a dielectric interface with air, liquid, and solid. This review first introduces the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures and further summarizes stimuli-responsive changes in optical properties, metal-field-enhanced optical signals, luminescence spectral shaping, chiroptical response, and photogenerated hot carriers. The current success in the landscape of nanoscience and nanotechnology mainly originates from the abundant optical properties of gold nanostructures in the thermodynamically stable face-centered cubic (fcc) phase. It has been further extended by crystal phase engineering to prepare thermodynamically unfavorable phases (e.g., kinetically stable) and heterophases to modulate their intriguing phase-dependent optical properties. A broad range of promising applications, including but not limited to full-color displays, solar energy harvesting, photochemical reactions, optical sensing, and microscopic/biomedical imaging, have fostered parallel research on the multitude of physical effects occurring in gold nanostructures.",

        "Abstract": "The accurate estimation of the mass and center of gravity (CG) position is key to vehicle dynamics modeling. The perturbation of key parameters in vehicle dynamics models can result in a reduction of accurate vehicle control and may even cause serious traffic accidents. A dual robust embedded cubature Kalman filter (RECKF) algorithm, which takes into account unknown measurement noise, is proposed for the joint estimation of mass and CG position. First, the mass parameters are identified based on directly obtained longitudinal forces in the distributed drive electric vehicle tires using the whole vehicle longitudinal dynamics model and the RECKF. Then, the CG is estimated with the RECKF using the mass estimation results and the vertical vehicle model. Finally, different virtual tests show that, compared with the cubature Kalman algorithm, the RECKF reduces the root mean square error of mass and CG by at least 7.4%, and 2.9%, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Early diagnosis of drug susceptibility for tuberculosis (TB) patients could guide the timely initiation of effective treatment. We evaluated a novel multiplex xMAP TIER (Tuberculosis-Isoniazid-Ethambutol-Rifampicin) assay based on the Luminex xMAP system to detect first-line anti-tuberculous drug resistance. Deoxyribonucleic acid samples from 353 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates were amplified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction, followed by hybridization and analysis through the xMAP system. Compared with the broth microdilution method, the sensitivity and specificity of the xMAP TIER assay for detecting resistance was 94.9% (95%CI, 90.0-99.8%) and 98.9% (95%CI, 97.7-100.0%) for rifampicin; 89.1% (95%CI, 83.9-94.3%) and 100.0% (95%CI, 100.0-100.0%) for isoniazid; 82.1% (95% CI, 68.0-96.3%) and 99.7% (95% CI, 99.0-100.0%) for ethambutol. With DNA sequencing as the reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of xMAP TIER for detecting resistance were 95.0% (95% CI, 90.2-99.8%) and 99.6% (95% CI, 98.9-100.0%) for rifampicin; 96.9% (95% CI, 93.8-99.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI, 100.0-100.0%) for isoniazid; 86.1% (95% CI, 74.8-97.4%) and 100.0% (95% CI, 100.0-100.0%) for ethambutol. The results achieved showed that the xMAP TIER assay had good performance for detecting first-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance, and it has the potential to diagnose drug-resistant tuberculosis more accurately due to the addition of more optimal design primers and probes on open architecture xMAP system.",

        "Abstract": "Maltodextrin (MD), the hydrolyzed starch product, is a promising alternative ingredient to improve the quality of starch-based foods. The effects of MD on the physicochemical, microstructural, and cooking properties of sweet potato starch (SPS) noodles, as well as the mechanism of SPS-MD interactions, are discussed. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated that MD at a suitable concentration can improve the ordered structure of SPS-MD gels. The cooking loss showed lower values of 1.47−2.16% at 0.5−2.0 wt% MD. For the texture properties, an increase in hardness and chewiness occurred at first with the addition of MD, followed by a decreasing trend, showing a maximum value at 2.0 wt% of MD. The pasting and thermal results verified the increased stability of the starch granules with MD < 3 wt%. Additionally, SPS formed a solid-like gel with MD, and the main interaction forces between SPS and MD were hydrogen bonding. The scanning electron microscopy results revealed that the higher concentrations of MD (>3 wt%) loosened the gel structure and markedly increased the pore size. These results help us to better understand the interaction mechanism of the SPS-MD complex and facilitate the development of SPS-based gel products.",

        "Abstract": "Melatonin (MT) can improve the effect of cryopreservation on oocytes by suppressing oxidative stress and maintaining the permeability of the oolemma. In this study, MT was firstly applied to human oocytes' cryopreservation to explore the effect of prolonged cryopreservation on developmental competence and its role. Collected in vitro-matured human oocytes were cryopreserved in MT-containing or MT-free medium for 0 and 6 months; after warming, viable oocytes were assessed for developmental viability, intracellular protein expression, mitochondrial function, and oxidation-antioxidant system. Meanwhile, fresh oocytes were set as the control. The results showed that with the extension of cryopreservation time, the developmental competence of oocytes gradually declined, accompanied by the down-regulation of most mitochondrial function-related proteins, the reduction in ATP and GSH production, the increase in ROS accumulation, and the aggravation of the imbalance of ROS/GSH in oocytes. However, the participation of MT seemed to effectively mitigate these negative effects. Therefore, we speculate that melatonin may maintain normal ATP production and ROS/GSH balance in cryopreserved oocytes by protecting mitochondrial function and inhibiting oxidative damage, thereby effectively maintaining the developmental competence of human oocytes in prolonged cryopreservation.",

        "Abstract": "This study investigated the effects of low molecular weight organic acids (citric acid and malic acid) on the migration properties of nickel in soil. A reclaimed soil sample was obtained from the Panyi Mine in Huainan City, China. The effects of adding different concentrations of Ni, citric acid (CA) and malic acid (MA) were assessed on the migration and transformation of soil Ni forms. The results showed: (1) An increase in soil Ni activity with increasing Ni concentrations. (2) An increased proportion of exchangeable forms of Ni in soil with increased malic acid and citric acid concentrations, effectively promoting Ni mobility. In addition, the active Ni fraction in reclaimed soil increased significantly with increasing concentrations of citric and malic acid. The nickel activation effect of citric acid was found to be higher than that of malic acid. (3) The activation effect of organic acids on Ni weakened with aging, exhibiting a gradual transformation from the loosely bound form of Ni, to the strongly bound form. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the phytoremediation techniques used for the treatment of Ni-polluted soils.",

The physicochemical properties were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimeter, X-ray diffractometry etc. The antioxidant activities of Tremella hydrocolloids were determined by ABTS radical, DPPH radical scavenging activity. The anti-aging ability of Tremella hydrocolloids was also investigated by using the organism model of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The results showed that the ES-THD displayed the highest radical scavenging capacity and the best anti-aging abilities. The ability of ES-THD to scavenge ABTS radicals reached 100 % at 2 mg/mL, the ability of ES-THD to scavenge DPPH radicals reached 45.55 %. Compared with the control group, the average lifespan was 29.17 % longer fed with ES-THD. These results provide the evidence basis for the use of Tremella hydrocolloids as food texture modifiers, antioxidants, and anti-aging agents in the food industries.",

Nanocellulose with many excellent properties can be used as a carrier and stabilizer to assist in the synthesis of AgNPs. In this study, cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were used to assist in the synthesis of AgNPs under the reduction of glucose and detection of glucose concentration under different conditions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the AgNPs in the nanocellulose-AgNPs (NC-AgNPs) system were roughly spherical and randomly distributed on the nanocellulose. In the whole reaction system, when the concentration of nanocellulose is 0.11 mg/mL, the concentration of silver ammonia solution is 0.6 mM, and the mixing time is 2.5 h, according to the UV-Vis analysis, the absorbance of CNF-AgNPs at 425 nm exhibited a good linear relationship (R",

        "Abstract": "Osteoclasts are the only multinucleated cells in vivo responsible for bone resorption and are vital for regulating bone remodeling and maintaining bone mass. The RAW264.7 cell line is widely used to study osteoclastic differentiation and biological molecular mechanism. However, protocols for inducing osteoclast formation in RAW264.7 cells vary considerably between laboratories, hindering the replication of results. Therefore, we tested the influence of culture conditions on osteoclast differentiation, including cell density and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) concentrations with or without macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSF). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was used to detect the morphology of osteoclasts. qPCR was used to detect gene expression of osteoclast-specific gene marker cathepsin K (CTSK), osteoclast transcription factors c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). The bone resorption function was evaluated by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). RANKL treatment increased multinucleated osteoclasts formation and increased CTSK, c-Fos and NFATc1 gene expression. Compared with RANKL treatment, M-CSF significantly decreased multinucleated osteoclasts formation, reduced CTSK gene expression and had little effect on c-Fos and NFATc1 gene expression. Concerning bone resorption activity, RANKL treatment increased bone resorption pits on bovine bone slices. Significantly higher levels of osteoclastogenesis were observed with RAW264.7-cell density of 2×104 cells/well in 24-well plates. Our results suggest that the addition of 50 ng/ml M-CSF has no positive effect on osteoclastogenesis. RANKL treatment and cell density contribute to osteoclast formation, and the optimal conditions are beneficial when exploring osteoclast function and mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "Mcm2, a subunit of the minichromosome maintenance proteins 2-7 (Mcm2-7) helicase best known for its role in DNA replication, contains a histone binding motif that facilitates the transfer of parental histones following DNA replication. Here, we show that Mcm2 is important for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Mcm2-2A mutation defective in histone binding shows defects in silencing of pluripotent genes and the induction of lineage-specific genes. The defects in the induction of lineage-specific genes in the mutant cells are likely, at least in part, due to reduced binding to Asf1a, a histone chaperone that binds Mcm2 and is important for nucleosome disassembly at bivalent chromatin domains containing repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 modifications during differentiation. Mcm2 localizes at transcription starting sites and the binding of Mcm2 at gene promoters is disrupted in both Mcm2-2A ES cells and neural precursor cells (NPCs). Reduced Mcm2 binding at bivalent chromatin domains in Mcm2-2A ES cells correlates with decreased chromatin accessibility at corresponding sites in NPCs. Together, our studies reveal a novel function of Mcm2 in ES cell differentiation, likely through manipulating chromatin landscapes at bivalent chromatin domains.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with diffuse midline gliomas that are H3K27 altered (DMG) display a dismal prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying DMG tumorigenesis remain poorly defined. Here we show that SMARCA4, the catalytic subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is essential for the proliferation, migration, and invasion of DMG cells and tumor growth in patient-derived DMG xenograft models. SMARCA4 colocalizes with SOX10 at gene regulatory elements to control the expression of genes involved in cell growth and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Moreover, SMARCA4 chromatin binding is reduced upon depletion of SOX10 or H3.3K27M, a mutation occurring in about 60% DMG tumors. Furthermore, the SMARCA4 occupancy at enhancers marked by both SOX10 and H3K27 acetylation is reduced the most upon depleting the H3.3K27M mutation. Taken together, our results support a model in which epigenome reprogramming by H3.3K27M creates a dependence on SMARCA4-mediated chromatin remodeling to drive gene expression and the pathogenesis of H3.3K27M DMG.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the clinical effects of microdissection testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) surgery combined with an intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) regimen in the treatment of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients with different etiologies. In total, 128 NOA patients participated in this study, in which they received infertility treatment by micro-TESE surgery combined with an ICSI regimen, and all patients were divided into three groups [the Klinefelter syndrome (KS), the idiopathic and the secondary NOA groups]. In addition, the sperm retrieval rate (SRR), fertilization rate, embryo development status and clinical treatment effects were analyzed. Among the 128 NOA patients, the SRR of KS NOA patients was 48.65%, those of idiopathic and the secondary patients were 33.82% and 73.91%, respectively. Regardless of etiologies, there was no correlation with age, hormone value or testicular volume. Further analysis showed that the SRR of the KS group was positively related with testosterone (T) values, and the SRR of the secondary group had a positive relationship with follicle-stimulating hormone or luteinizing hormone values. In the subsequent clinical treatment, the retrieved sperm was subjected to ICSI and achieved good treatment effects, especially in the secondary group, and the implantation rate (55.56%) and clinical pregnancy rate (68.42%) were both higher than those of the idiopathic group (28.75% and 40.00%) and KS group (22.05% and 30.77%). Micro-TESE surgery combined with ICSI insemination is the most effective treatment regimen for NOA patients. The SRR of NOA patients with different etiologies are related to certain specific factors, and micro-TESE surgery seems to be the ideal and only way to have biological children.",

Here, we developed a highly sensitive oxygen gas sensor based on deep ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy between 180 and 200 nm. The implemented method relies on differential absorption spectra extracted from the obtained high-resolution absorption spectra. The detection capability was greatly improved (six-fold) by eliminating air from the open optical path, achieved by purging the entire system with pure nitrogen. A linear relationship was obtained between the optical parameter and the oxygen concentration with a slope of 0.107 and determination coefficient of 0.999. A detection limit of 24 ppm per meter was determined with a response time of 25 s. Good repeatability (",

        "Abstract": "Thermal management of concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) modules is essential to avoid the decrease in conversion efficiency caused by temperature rise during their operation. This is even more important for laser-concentrated CPV hybrid systems where out-of-control temperature rise is more likely to happen. In this research, a three-dimensional simulation model for a concentrated photovoltaic-thermoelectric (CPV-TE) hybrid system was studied to optimize its parameters and improve its conversion efficiency under laser radiation. Based on the simulation results, an integrated CPV-TE device was designed, fabricated, and tested under a high-power laser. The novel integrated CPV-TE system utilizes growing electrodes to encapsulate CPV directly on the TEG. Compared to conventional CPV-TE systems that utilize silicone-filled, the integrated CPV-TE system reduces contact thermal resistance and increases output power as well as conversion efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to discuss and optimize a CPV-TE hybrid system for laser radiation. In addition, this research improves the efficiency of laser energy conversion, increases the reliability and stability of the system, and may facilitate the promotion of optical wireless and fiber power transmission systems in future applications.",

Both aryl/alkenyl iodines and bromides were found to be competent electrophiles that reacted with alkyl isocyanides, affording nitrile compounds in moderate to good yields. A range of functional groups including halogens as well as hydroxyl, formyl, and acetamino groups were fairly compatible with the nickel catalysis. This protocol featured broad functional group tolerance, simple reaction conditions, and gram-scale synthesis.",

But most existing EEG studies focus on mean group effects (commonality) by averaging signals over trials and subjects. The substantial intra- and inter-subject variability of EEG have often been overlooked. The recently significant technological advances in machine learning, especially deep learning, have brought technological innovations to EEG signal application in many aspects, but there are still great challenges in cross-session, cross-task, and cross-subject EEG decoding.

        "Abstract": "Dietary intake is one of the main pathways for residents to become exposed to chlorinated paraffins (CPs). In China, due to the popularization of nutritional and medicinal edible fungi, consumption has increased on a yearly basis. Edible fungi have a variety of active substances and are consumed daily by residents. However, there is limited information on the concentration and source of chlorinated paraffins in edible fungi. In this study, the concentrations of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) in 105 edible fungi samples and 36 culture material samples were detected. The concentration range of SCCPs was 79.8 ng/g dw to 3879.3 ng/g dw, and the MCCPs was ND to 572.3 ng/g dw. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the sources of SCCPs and MCCPs in edible fungi were similar (r = 0.57, p < 0.01). The preponderant SCCPs and MCCPs congener group profiles were C",

        "Abstract": "Excessive cholangiocyte expansion (ductular reaction) promotes liver disease progression, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we identify biliary NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) as a pivotal regulator of ductular reaction. NIK is known to activate the noncanonical IKKα/NF-κB2 pathway and regulate lymphoid tissue development. We find that cholangiocyte NIK is upregulated in mice with cholestasis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL), 5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), or α-naphtyl-isothiocyanate (ANIT). DDC, ANIT, or BDL induces ductular reaction, liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. Cholangiocyte-specific deletion of NIK, but not IKKα, blunts these pathological alterations. NIK inhibitor treatment similarly ameliorates DDC-induced ductular reaction, liver injury, and fibrosis. Biliary NIK directly increases cholangiocyte proliferation while suppressing cholangiocyte death, and it also promotes secretion of cholangiokines from cholangiocytes. Cholangiokines stimulate liver macrophages and hepatic stellate cells, augmenting liver inflammation and fibrosis. These results unveil a NIK/ductular reaction axis and a NIK/cholangiokine axis that promote liver disease progression.",

Here, we introduce culture-enriched phenotypic metagenomics that integrates culture enrichment, phenotypic screening, and metagenomic analyses as an emerging standardized methodology for targeted resistome monitoring and apply it to decipher the extended-spectrum β-lactam resistome in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and its receiving river. The results showed that clinically prevalent carbapenemase genes (e.g., the NDM and KPC families) and extended-spectrum β-lactamase genes (e.g., the CTX-M, TEM, and OXA families) were prevalent in the WWTP and showed prominent potential in horizontal dissemination. Strikingly, carbapenem and polymyxin resistance genes co-occurred in the highly virulent nosocomial pathogens ",

        "Abstract": "The effect of low-molecular-weight organic acids (citric acid and malic acid) on the migration characteristics of Pb in contaminated soils was explored in this study. Reclaimed soil was collected from the coal gangue hill area of the Panyi mine in Huainan City (China). The effect of citric acid and malic acid on the form of Pb present in the reclaimed soil was analyzed by spiking soil samples and simulating Pb-contaminated soil. The results indicate the following. 1) With increased concentration of exogenous Pb, the activity of Pb in the reclaimed soil was effectively improved. 2) The addition of citric acid and malic acid both resulted in an increased fraction of exchangeable Pb in the soil, which effectively promoted the active Pb fraction. As the concentrations of citric acid and malic acid increased, the active Pb fraction of the reclaimed soil increased accordingly. The Pb activation effect of citric acid was observed to be greater than that of malic acid. 3) With extended soil aging time, the activation effect of organic acids on Pb weakened, with the loosely bound Pb gradually transforming into strongly bound Pb. Chelating agents can activate heavy metals in soil, mainly through the combination of chelating agents and heavy metal ions in the soil solution to form soluble metal chelates, so as to increase the bioavailability of heavy metals in soil to plant roots. Therefore, adding citric acid can be considered as a strategy to enhance the efficiency of reclaimed soil remediation because of the ability of Pb activation.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoclasts (OCs) are multinucleated cells that play a major role in osteolytic diseases such as osteoporosis. Monascin (Ms) is one of the active substances in the traditional Chinese medicine red yeast rice. Studies have found that red yeast rice can maintain bone health. In this study, the anti-osteoclastogenesis effects of Ms on RANKL-induced RAW264.7 cells were assessed, and the underlying mechanism was investigated. Ms exhibited inhibitory effects on OC differentiation and formation in a dose-dependent manner and suppressed the bone-resorbing activity of mature OCs. Ms blocked OCs-typical genes (c-Fos, NFATc1, CSTK, MMP-9, TRAP, ITG-β3, OSCAR and DC-STAMP). Furthermore, Ms treatment considerably inhibited the activation of MAPKs, JNK and p38. Taken together, Ms suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells by restraining MAPKs signaling pathways and is a potential therapeutic option as a novel OC inhibitor to mitigate bone erosion.",

        "Abstract": "Zona pellucida (ZP) abnormalities are the cause of low fertility or infertility, agar-like ZP is more common in abnormal ZP. The purpose of this exploration is to systematically analyze the fertilization competence of agar-like ZP oocytes, the development characteristics of subsequent embryos as well as the results of embryo transfer, aiming to explore effective clinical treatment strategies. A total of 58 patients with agar-like ZP were set as the case group and the control group involved 3866 patients, in which the patients' oocytes presented normal ZP. BMI, basal hormone levels, and hormone levels were similar in both groups. The case patients suffered significantly longer infertility years than control (p<0.05), and most patients were diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory diseases. A distinct difference was observed in the structure of oocyte corona cumulus complexes between the two groups. The embryo development parameters, which include the rates of cleavage, high-quality embryo, blastocyst, and high-quality blastocyst in the case group were greatly lower than that in the control group (p<0.05). The rates of cumulative clinical pregnancy and live birth were comparable between the two groups. In the subsequent follow-up, thirty-four of the 58 patients receiving intracytoplasmic single sperm injection (ICSI) or early rescue ICSI (R-ICSI) treatment successfully gave birth to babies, and all of the newborns were with no neonatal defects. In addition, the fertilization rate of the R-ICSI group was significantly lower than that of the ICSI group (p<0.05). The occurrence of agar-like ZP impairs the development competence of human oocytes, however, the human oocytes with agar-like ZP can develop into healthy offspring, and an ICSI regimen is the optimal treatment strategy for them.",

        "Abstract": "Sacubitril/valsartan, the first angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration for marketing, has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization and improve symptoms in patients with chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. However, some researchers have also found that sacubitril/valsartan has an antiarrhythmic effect. The mechanism by which sacubitril/valsartan reduces the mortality associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias is not precise. Many studies have concluded that ventricular arrhythmia is associated with a reduction in myocardial fibrosis. This article reviews the current understanding of the effects of sacubitril/valsartan on the reduction of ventricular arrhythmia and explains its possible mechanisms. The results of this study suggest that sacubitril/valsartan reduces the occurrence of appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks. Meanwhile, sacubitril/valsartan may reduce the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias by affecting 3 pathways of B-type natriuretic peptide, Angiotensin II, and Bradykinin. The conclusion of this study is that sacubitril/valsartan reduces the number of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks and ventricular arrhythmias in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients.",

While how genetic information is passed through generations has been extensively characterized, it remains largely obscure how epigenetic information encoded by chromatin regulates the passage of certain traits, gene expression states and cell identity during mitotic cell divisions, and even through meiosis. In this review, we will summarize the recent advances on molecular mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance, discuss the potential impacts of epigenetic inheritance during normal development and in some disease conditions, and outline future research directions for this challenging, but exciting field.",

        "Abstract": "DNA replication stress threatens ordinary DNA synthesis. The evolutionarily conserved DNA replication stress response pathway involves sensor kinase Mec1/ATR, adaptor protein Mrc1/Claspin, and effector kinase Rad53/Chk1, which spurs a host of changes to stabilize replication forks and maintain genome integrity. DNA replication forks consist of largely distinct sets of proteins at leading and lagging strands that function autonomously in DNA synthesis in vitro. In this article, we discuss eSPAN and BrdU-IP-ssSeq, strand-specific sequencing technologies that permit analysis of protein localization and DNA synthesis at individual strands in budding yeast. Using these approaches, we show that under replication stress Rad53 stalls DNA synthesis on both leading and lagging strands. On lagging strands, it stimulates PCNA unloading, and on leading strands, it attenuates the replication function of Mrc1-Tof1. We propose that in doing so, Rad53 couples leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis during replication stress, thereby preventing the emergence of harmful ssDNA.",

        "Abstract": "Spatially remote brain regions show synchronized activity as typically revealed by correlated functional MRI (fMRI) signals. An emerging line of research has focused on the temporal fluctuations of connectivity; however, its relationships with stationary connectivity have not been clearly illustrated. We examined dynamic and stationary connectivity when the participants watched four different movie clips. We calculated point-by-point multiplication between two regional time series to estimate the time-resolved dynamic connectivity, and estimated the inter-individual consistency of the dynamic connectivity time series. Widespread consistent dynamic connectivity was observed for each movie clip, which also showed differences between the clips. For example, a cartoon movie clip, Wall-E, showed more consistent of dynamic connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus, while a court drama clip, A Few Good Men, showed more consistent of dynamic connectivity with the auditory cortex and temporoparietal junction, which might suggest the involvement of specific brain processing for different movie contents. In contrast, the stationary connectivity as measured by the correlations between regional time series was highly similar among the movie clips, and showed fewer statistically significant differences. The patterns of consistent dynamic connectivity could be used to classify different movie clips with higher accuracy than the stationary connectivity and regional activity. These results support the functional significance of dynamic connectivity in reflecting functional brain changes, which could provide more functionally relevant information than stationary connectivity.",

        "Abstract": "For micron-sized nickel-based hydroxides sheets, the reaction and migration of anions/water molecules in the inner region tends to lag behind those along the edge, which can cause structure mismatch and capacity degradation during cycles. Nanosizing and structure design is a feasible solution to shorten the ion/electron path and improve the reaction homogeneity. Herein, this study reports a novel three-stage strategy (self-assembly of NiMn-LDH/ppy-C - reduction to NiMn/ppy-C - in situ phase transformation into NiMn/NiMn-LDH/ppy-C) to reduce the sheet size of NiMn-LDH to nanometer. Triggered by electrochemical activation, NiMn-LDH nanosheets can hereby easily and orderly grow on the exposed active (111) crystal plane of Ni to establish NiMn-LDH/NiMn heterostructure around ppy-C. Importantly, nanosizing and hierarchical structure play a synergistic role to maintain structural integrity and to promote the electron/mass transfer kinetics. The NiMn/NiMn-LDH/ppy-C composite delivers superior cycling stability with almost no decay of capacity retention after 40,000 cycles at 5 A g",

        "Abstract": "Preoperative prediction of lymph node (LN) metastasis based on computed tomography (CT) scans is an important task in gastric cancer, but few machine learning-based techniques have been proposed. While multi-center datasets increase sample size and representation ability, they suffer from inter-center heterogeneity. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel multi-source domain adaptation framework for this diagnosis task, which not only considers domain-invariant and domain-specific features, but also achieves the imbalanced knowledge transfer and class-aware feature alignment across domains. First, we develop a 3D improved feature pyramidal network (i.e., 3D IFPN) to extract common multi-level features from the high-resolution 3D CT images, where a feature dynamic transfer (FDT) module can promote the network's ability to recognize the small target (i.e., LN). Then, we design an unsupervised domain selective graph convolutional network (i.e., UDS-GCN), which mainly includes three types of components: domain-specific feature extractor, domain selector and class-aware GCN classifier. Specifically, multiple domain-specific feature extractors are employed for learning domain-specific features from the common multi-level features generated by the 3D IFPN. A domain selector via the optimal transport (OT) theory is designed for controlling the amount of knowledge transferred from source domains to the target domain. A class-aware GCN classifier is developed to explicitly enhance/weaken the intra-class/inter-class similarity of all sample pairs across domains. To optimize UDS-GCN, the domain selector and the class-aware GCN classifier provide reliable target pseudo-labels to each other in the iterative process by collaborative learning. The extensive experiments are conducted on an in-house CT image dataset collected from four medical centers to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. Experimental results verify that the proposed method boosts LN metastasis diagnosis performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publically available at https://github.com/infinite-tao/LN_MSDA.",

        "Abstract": "Newly synthesized H3.1 and H3.3 histones are assembled into nucleosomes by different histone chaperones in replication-coupled and replication-independent pathways, respectively. However, it is not clear how parental H3.3 molecules are transferred following DNA replication, especially when compared to H3.1. Here, by monitoring parental H3.1- and H3.3-SNAP signals, we show that parental H3.3, like H3.1, are stably transferred into daughter cells. Moreover, Mcm2-Pola1 and Pole3-Pole4, two pathways involved in parental histone transfer based upon the analysis of modifications on parental histones, participate in the transfer of both H3.1 and H3.3 following DNA replication. Lastly, we found that Mcm2, Pole3 and Pole4 mutants defective in parental histone transfer show defects in chromosome segregation. These results indicate that in contrast to deposition of newly synthesized H3.1 and H3.3, transfer of parental H3.1 and H3.3 is mediated by these shared mechanisms, which contributes to epigenetic memory of gene expression and maintenance of genome stability.",

        "Title": "Lrwd1 impacts cell proliferation and the silencing of repetitive DNA elements.",
        "Abstract": "LRWD1, also known as ORCA, is a nuclear protein functioning in multiple biological processes. Using its WD40 domain LRWD1 interacts with repressive histone marks and maintains the silencing of heterochromatin regions in mammalian cells. ORCA also associates with the origin recognition complex (ORC) and facilitates prereplication complex formation at late-replicating origins. However, whether LRWD1 plays a role during development and the functional significance of LRWD1 in vivo remains largely unknown. Using gene-trap approach we generated Lrwd1 knockout mice and examined the expression of Lrwd1 during embryonic development. We found that Lrwd1 is ubiquitously expressed in the majority of the developing mouse embryo. Depletion of LRWD1 did not affect embryonic development but the postnatal growth of the homozygous mutants is retarded. In vitro cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) depleted of LRWD1 displayed a reduced proliferation compared to wild type cells. We also showed that the knockout of Lrwd1 in MEFs increased the expression of the epigenetically silenced repetitive elements but with minimal effect on the expression of protein coding genes. Together, these results suggest that LRWD1 plays an important, but not essential, role in postnatal development by regulating cell proliferation likely through modulating DNA replication.",

        "Abstract": "Characterization and prediction of individual difference of pain sensitivity are of great importance in clinical practice. MRI techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), have been popularly used to predict an individual's pain sensitivity, but existing studies are limited by using one single imaging modality (fMRI or DTI) and/or using one type of metrics (regional or connectivity features). As a result, pain-relevant information in MRI has not been fully revealed and the associations among different imaging modalities and different features have not been fully explored for elucidating pain sensitivity. In this study, we investigated the predictive capability of multi-features (regional and connectivity metrics) of multimodal MRI (fMRI and DTI) in the prediction of pain sensitivity using data from 210 healthy subjects. We found that fusing fMRI-DTI and regional-connectivity features are capable of more accurately predicting an individual's pain sensitivity than only using one type of feature or using one imaging modality. These results revealed rich information regarding individual pain sensitivity from the brain's both structural and functional perspectives as well as from both regional and connectivity metrics. Hence, this study provided a more comprehensive characterization of the neural correlates of individual pain sensitivity, which holds a great potential for clinical pain management.",

        "Abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis is a powerful tool to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of human brain activity, through analyzing the quasi-stable states in EEG signals. However, current studies mainly focus on rest-state EEG recordings, microstate analysis for the recording of EEG signals during naturalistic tasks is limited. It remains an open question whether current topographical clustering strategies for rest-state microstate analysis could be directly applied to task-state EEG data under the natural and dynamic conditions and whether stable and reliable results could still be achieved. It is necessary to answer the question and explore whether the topographical clustering strategies would affect the performance of microstate detection in task-state EEG microstate analysis. If it exists differences in microstate detection performance when different topographical clustering strategies are adopted, then we want to know how the alternations of the topographical clustering strategies are associated with the naturalistic task. To answer these questions, we work on a public emotion database using naturalistic and dynamic music videos as the stimulation to evaluate the effects of different topographical clustering strategies for task-state EEG microstate analysis. The performance results are systematically examined and compared in terms of microstate quality, task efficacy, and computational efficiency, and the impact of topographical clustering strategies on microstate analysis for naturalistic task data is discussed. The results reveal that a single-trial-based bottom-up topographical clustering strategy (bottom-up) achieves comparable results with the task-driven-based top-down topographical clustering (top-down). It suggests that, when task information is unknown, the single-trial-based topographical clustering could be a good choice for microstate analysis and neural activity study on naturalistic EEG data.",

        "Abstract": "Transgenic technology can transfer favorable traits regardless of reproductive isolation and is an important method in plant synthetic biology and genetic improvement. Complex metabolic pathway modification and pyramiding breeding strategies often require the introduction of multiple genes at once, but the current vector assembly systems for constructing multigene expression cassettes are not completely satisfactory. In this study, a new in vitro gene stacking system, GuanNan Stacking (GNS), was developed. Through the introduction of Type IIS restriction enzyme-mediated Golden Gate cloning, GNS allows the modular, standardized assembly of target gene expression cassettes. Because of the introduction of Gateway recombination, GNS facilitates the cloning of superlarge transgene expression cassettes, allows multiple expression cassettes to be efficiently assembled in a binary vector simultaneously, and is compatible with the Cre enzyme-mediated marker deletion mechanism. The linked dual positive-negative marker selection strategy ensures the efficient acquisition of target recombinant plasmids without prokaryotic selection markers in the T-DNA region. The host-independent negative selection marker combined with the TAC backbone ensures the cloning and transfer of large T-DNAs (>100 kb). Using the GNS system, we constructed a binary vector containing five foreign gene expression cassettes and obtained transgenic rice carrying the target traits, proving that the method developed in this research is a powerful tool for plant metabolic engineering and compound trait transgenic breeding.",

The changes in air quality during the pandemic have been investigated in numerous studies via satellite observations. Nevertheless, no relevant research has been gathered using Chinese satellite instruments, because the poor spectral quality makes it extremely difficult to retrieve data from the spectra of the Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI), the first Chinese satellite-based ultraviolet-visible spectrometer monitoring air pollutants. However, through a series of remote sensing algorithm optimizations from spectral calibration to retrieval, we successfully retrieved global gaseous pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO",

        "Title": "A new perspective on individual reliability beyond group effect for event-related potentials: A multisensory investigation and computational modeling.",
        "Abstract": "The dominant approach in investigating the individual reliability for event-related potentials (ERPs) is to extract peak-related features at electrodes showing the strongest group effects. Such a peak-based approach implicitly assumes ERP components showing a stronger group effect are also more reliable, but this assumption has not been substantially validated and few studies have investigated the reliability of ERPs beyond peaks. In this study, we performed a rigorous evaluation of the test-retest reliability of ERPs collected in a multisensory and cognitive experiment from 82 healthy adolescents, each having two sessions. By comparing group effects and individual reliability, we found that a stronger group-level response in ERPs did not guarantee higher reliability. A perspective of neural oscillation should be adopted for the analysis of reliability. Further, by simulating ERPs with an oscillation-based computational model, we found that the consistency between group-level ERP responses and individual reliability was modulated by inter-subject latency jitter and inter-trial variability. The current findings suggest that the conventional peak-based approach may underestimate the individual reliability in ERPs and a neural oscillation perspective on ERP reliability should be considered. Hence, a comprehensive evaluation of the reliability of ERP measurements should be considered in individual-level neurophysiological trait evaluation and psychiatric disorder diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "Alpha band oscillations are the most prominent rhythmic oscillations in EEG, which are related to various types of mental diseases, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression. However, the dynamics of alpha oscillations, especially how the endogenous alpha oscillations be entrained by exogenous stimulus, are still unclear. Recently, a newly-developed phase-locked visual feedback (PLVF) protocol has shown effectiveness in modulating alpha rhythm, which provides empirical evidence for the further investigation of the neural mechanism of alpha dynamics. In this work, extensive numerical simulations based on four well-studied models were used to investigate the questions that (1) What kind of dynamic model exhibits a modulation phenomenon of PLVF? (2) What is the dynamic mechanism of PLVF for alpha modulation? (3) Which factors affect the modulation effects in PLVF? The result indicates that the dynamics of endogenous alpha oscillations are close to a simpler dynamic structure, like fixed-point attractor or limit-cycle attractor, which shows a global consistent dynamic behavior at different phases of the alpha oscillation. The further analysis explains the dynamic mechanism of PLVF for amplitude and frequency modulation of the alpha rhythm, as well as the influence of parameter settings in the modulation. All these findings provide a deeper understanding of the endogenous alpha oscillations entrained by exogenous phased locked visual stimulus and lead in turn to the refinement of a control strategy for alpha modulation, which could potentially be used in developing new neural modulation methods for cognitive enhancement and mental diseases treatment.",

A total of 54 participants including 38 LBP and 16 PHN patients were enrolled. The average pain scores were 7.6 and 7.5 for LBP and PHN. High-resolution structural T1 weighted images were obtained. Both grey matter volume (GMV) and morphological connectivity (MC) were extracted. An independent two-sample t-test with false discovery rate (FDR) correction was used to identify the brain regions where LBP and PHN patients showed significant GMV difference. Next, we explored the differences of MC network between LBP and PHN patients and detected the group differences in network properties by using the two-sample t-test and FDR correction. Compared with PHN, LBP patients had significantly larger GMV in temporal gyrus, insula and fusiform gyrus (p < 0.05). The LBP cohort had significantly stronger MC in the connection between right precuneus and left opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus (p < 0.05). LBP patients had significantly stronger degree in left anterior cingulate gyrus and left rectus gyrus (p < 0.05) while had significantly weaker degree than PHN patients in left orbital part of middle frontal gyrus, left supplementary motor area and left superior parietal lobule (p < 0.05). LBP and PHN patients had significant differences in the brain's GMV, MC, and network properties, which implies that different PNPs have different neural mechanisms concerning pain modulation.",

        "Abstract": "Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that brain responses to nociceptive pain, non-nociceptive somatosensory, visual, and auditory stimuli are extremely similar. Actually, perception of external sensory stimulation requires complex interactions among distributed cortical and subcortical brain regions. However, the interactions among these regions elicited by nociceptive pain remain unclear, which limits our understanding of mechanisms of pain from a brain network perspective. Task fMRI data were collected with a random sequence of intermixed stimuli of four sensory modalities in 80 healthy subjects. Whole-brain psychophysiological interaction analysis was performed to identify task-modulated functional connectivity (FC) patterns for each modality. Task-modulated FC strength and graph-theoretical-based network properties were compared among the four modalities. Lastly, we performed across-sensory-modality prediction analysis based on the whole-brain task-modulated FC patterns to confirm the specific relationship between brain patterns and sensory modalities. For each sensory modality, task-modulated FC patterns were distributed over widespread brain regions beyond those typically activated or deactivated during the stimulation. As compared with the other three sensory modalities, nociceptive stimulation exhibited significantly different patterns (more widespread and stronger FC within the cingulo-opercular network, between cingulo-opercular and sensorimotor networks, between cingulo-opercular and emotional networks, and between default mode and emotional networks) and global property (smaller modularity). Further, a cross-sensory-modality prediction analysis found that task-modulated FC patterns could predict sensory modality at the subject level successfully. Collectively, these results demonstrated that the whole-brain task-modulated FC is preferentially modulated by pain, thus providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of pain processing.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial dynamics (fission and fusion) are essential physiological processes for mitochondrial metabolic function, mitochondrial redistribution, and mitochondrial quality control. Various proteins are involved in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. Aberrant expression of these proteins interferes with mitochondrial dynamics and induces a range of diseases. Multiple therapeutic approaches have been developed to treat the related diseases in recent years, but their curative effects are limited. Meanwhile, the role of mitochondrial dynamics in female reproductive function has attracted progressively more attention, including oocyte development and maturation, fertilization, and embryonic development. Here, we reviewed the significance of mitochondrial dynamics, proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics, and disorders resulting from primary mitochondrial dynamic dysfunction. We summarized the latest therapeutic approaches of hereditary mitochondrial fusion-fission abnormalities and reviewed the recent advances in female reproductive mitochondrial dynamics.",

        "Abstract": "Early diagnosis and intervention of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its early stage (i.e., subjective cognitive decline (SCD)) is able to delay or reverse the disease progression. However, discrimination between SCD, MCI and healthy subjects accurately remains challenging. This paper proposes an auto-weighted centralised multi-task (AWCMT) learning framework for differential diagnosis of SCD and MCI. AWCMT is based on structural and functional connectivity information inferred from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To be specific, we devise a novel multi-task learning algorithm to combine neuroimaging functional and structural connective information. We construct a functional brain network through a sparse and low-rank machine learning method, and also a structural brain network via fibre bundle tracking. Those two networks are constructed separately and independently. Multi-task learning is then used to identify features integration of functional and structural connectivity. Hence, we can learn each task's significance automatically in a balanced way. By combining the functional and structural information, the most informative features of SCD and MCI are obtained for diagnosis. The extensive experiments on the public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm obtains better performance in classifying SCD, MCI and healthy people than traditional algorithms. The newly proposed method has good interpretability as it is able to discover the most disease-related brain regions and their connectivity. The results agree well with current clinical findings and provide new insights into early AD detection based on the multi-modal neuroimaging technique.",

        "Abstract": "Drug-induced hepatotoxicity limits development of new effective medications. Drugs and numerous endogenous/exogenous agents are metabolized/detoxified by hepatocytes, during which reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated as a by-product. ROS has broad adverse effects on liver function and integrity, including damaging hepatocyte proteins, lipids, and DNA and promoting liver inflammation and fibrosis. ROS in concert with iron overload drives ferroptosis. Hepatic nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-inducing kinase (NIK) is aberrantly activated in a broad spectrum of liver disease. NIK phosphorylates and activates inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit alpha (IKKα), and the hepatic NIK/IKKα cascade suppresses liver regeneration. However, the NIK/IKKα pathway has not been explored in drug-induced liver injury. Here, we identify hepatic NIK as a previously unrecognized mediator for acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver failure. APAP treatment increased both NIK transcription and NIK protein stability in primary hepatocytes as well as in liver in mice. Hepatocyte-specific overexpression of NIK augmented APAP-induced liver oxidative stress in mice and increased hepatocyte death and mortality in a ROS-dependent manner. Conversely, hepatocyte-specific ablation of NIK or IKKα mitigated APAP-elicited hepatotoxicity and mortality. NIK increased lipid peroxidation and cell death in APAP-stimulated primary hepatocytes. Pretreatment with antioxidants or ferroptosis inhibitors blocked NIK/APAP-induced hepatocyte death. Conclusion: We unravel a previously unrecognized NIK/IKKα/ROS/ferroptosis axis engaged in liver disease progression.",

        "Abstract": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback (NFB) is a popular neuromodulation method to help one selectively enhance or inhibit his/her brain activities by means of real-time visual or auditory feedback of EEG signals. Sensory motor rhythm (SMR) NFB protocol has been applied to improve cognitive performance, but a large proportion of participants failed to self-regulate their brain activities and could not benefit from NFB training. Therefore, it is important to identify the neural predictors of SMR up-regulation NFB training performance for a better understanding the mechanisms of individual difference in SMR NFB. Twenty-seven healthy participants (12 males, age: 23.1 ± 2.36) were enrolled to complete three sessions of SMR up-regulation NFB training and collection of multimodal neuroimaging data [resting-state EEG, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)]. Correlation analyses were performed between within-session NFB learning index and anatomical and functional brain features extracted from multimodal neuroimaging data, in order to identify the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological predictors for NFB learning performance. Lastly, machine learning models were trained to predict NFB learning performance using features from each modality as well as multimodal features. According to our results, most participants were able to successfully increase the SMR power and the NFB learning performance was significantly correlated with a set of neuroimaging features, including resting-state EEG powers, gray/white matter volumes from MRI, regional and functional connectivity (FC) of resting-state fMRI. Importantly, results of prediction analysis indicate that NFB learning index can be better predicted using multimodal features compared with features of single modality. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of multimodal neuroimaging technique as a tool to explain the individual difference in within-session NFB learning performance, and could provide a theoretical framework for early identification of individuals who cannot benefit from NFB training.",

        "Abstract": "There is growing interest in developing triplet photosensitizers in terms of implementing photochemical strategies in synthetic chemistry. However, synthesis of stable triplet organic photosensitizers is nontrivial and often requires the use of heavy atoms. Herein, an alternative strategy is demonstrated to enhance the triplet generation efficiency by implanting lone-pair donor-acceptor bonds in the conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This powerful method is validated using COFs that host triazine, a moiety that has been extensively investigated in photocatalysis. Spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal substantial improvements in the photoabsorptivity and triple-state photogeneration efficiency, consistent with catalytic tests concerning industrially relevant sulfide oxidation. These systems represent a promising addition to the rapidly increasing arsenal of synthetic photocatalytic systems.",

        "Abstract": "Coexistence and cooperation between dogs and humans over thousands of years have supported convergent evolutionary processes in the two species. Previous studies found that Eurasian dogs evolved into a distinct geographic cluster. In this study, we used the genomes of 242 European dogs, 38 Southeast Asian indigenous (SEAI) dogs, and 41 gray wolves to identify adaptation of European dogs . We report 86 unique positively selected genes in European dogs, among which is LCT (lactase). LCT encodes lactase, which is fundamental for the digestion of lactose. We found that an A-to-G mutation (chr19:38,609,592) is almost fixed in Middle Eastern and European dogs. The results of two-dimensional site frequency spectrum (2D SFS) support that the mutation is under soft sweep . We inferred that the onset of positive selection of the mutation is shorter than 6,535 years and behind the well-developed dairy economy in central Europe. It increases the expression of LCT by reducing its binding with ZEB1, which would enhance dog's ability to digest milk-based diets. Our study uncovers the genetic basis of convergent evolution between humans and dogs with respect to diet, emphasizing the import of the dog as a biomedical model for studying mechanisms of the digestive system.",

        "Abstract": "Theta oscillations over the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) play vital roles in sustained attention. Specifically, pMFC power and pMFC-LPFC synchronization correlate with cognitive control in sustained-attention-related tasks, but the causal relationships remain unknown. In the present study, we first analyzed the correlation between EEG theta oscillations (characterized by time-frequency power and phase-based connectivity) and the level of sustained attention (Experiment 1) and then utilized transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate theta oscillations and in turn observed its effects on sustained attention (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, two time-frequency regions of interest (ROIs) were determined, in which high/low time-frequency power and high/low phase-based connectivity corresponded to high/low-level sustained attention. In Experiment 2, time-frequency power and phase-based connectivity of theta oscillations were compared between the sham and tACS groups within the time-frequency ROIs determined in Experiment 1. Results showed that phase-based connectivity between pMFC and LPFC significantly decreased in the tACS group compared with the sham group during the first five minutes of the poststimulation period. Moreover, a marginal trend existed that sustained attention was downregulated by tACS in the same time interval, suggesting that theta phase synchronization between pMFC and LPFC may play a causal role in sustained attention.",

        "Abstract": "The level of immunoglobulin M (IgM) displayed on the surface of peripheral blood B cells exhibits a broad dynamic range and has been associated with both development and selection. To determine whether IgM surface expression associates with distinct immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH) repertoire properties, we performed deep IgM sequencing of peripheral blood transitional and mature naïve B cells in the upper and lower quartiles of surface IgM expression for 12 healthy donors. Mature naïve B cells within the lowest quartile for surface IgM expression displayed more diverse IGH features including increased complementarity-determining region 3 length, IGHJ6 segment usage and aromatic amino acids compared with mature naïve B cells with high surface IgM. There were no differences between IGH repertoires for transitional B cells with high or low surface IgM. These findings suggest that a selection checkpoint during progression of transitional to mature naïve B cells reduces the breadth of the IGH repertoire among high surface IgM B cells but that diversity is preserved in B cells expressing low levels of surface IgM.",

        "Abstract": "The existence of nociceptive-specific brain regions has been a controversial issue for decades. Multisensory fMRI studies, which examine fMRI activities in response to various types of sensory stimulation, could help identify nociceptive-specific brain regions, but previous studies are limited by sample size and they did not differentiate nociceptive-specific regions and nociceptive-preferential regions, which have significantly larger responses to nociceptive input. In this study, we conducted a multisensory fMRI experiment on 80 healthy participants, with the aim to determine whether there are certain brain regions that specifically or preferentially respond to nociceptive stimulation. By comparing the evoked fMRI responses across four sensory modalities, we found a series of brain regions specifically or preferentially involved in nociceptive sensory input. Particularly, we found different parts of some cortical regions, such as insula and cingulate gyrus, play different functional roles in the processing of nociceptive stimulation. Hence, this multisensory study improves our understanding of the functional integrations and segregations of the nociceptive-related regions.",

        "Title": "Efficient and strand-specific profiling of replicating chromatin with enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA in mammalian cells.",
        "Abstract": "Faithful duplication of both genetic and epigenetic information is essential for all eukaryotic cells. DNA replication initiates from replication origins and proceeds bidirectionally but asymmetrically, with the leading strand being synthesized continuously and the lagging strand discontinuously as Okazaki fragments by distinct DNA polymerases. Unraveling the underlying mechanisms of chromatin replication at both strands is crucial to better understand DNA replication and its coupled processes, including nucleosome assembly, sister chromatid cohesion and DNA mismatch repair. Here we describe the enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA (eSPAN) method to analyze the enrichment of proteins of interest, including histones and their modifications at replicating chromatin in a strand-specific manner in mammalian cells. Briefly, cells are pulsed with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine to label newly synthesized DNA. After cell permeabilization, the target proteins are sequentially bound by antibodies and protein A-fused transposase, which digests and tags genomic DNA of interest once activated by magnesium. The strand specificity is preserved through oligo-replacement. Finally, the resulting double-strand DNA is denatured and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against bromodeoxyuridine to enrich nascent DNA associated with proteins of interest. After PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing, the mapped reads are used to calculate the relative enrichment of the target proteins around replication origins. Compared with alternative methods, the eSPAN protocol is simple, cost-effective and sensitive, even in a relatively small number of mammalian cells. The whole procedures from cell collection to generation of sequencing-ready libraries can be completed in 2 days.",

The resonant frequency of the proposed leakage current sensor is about 100 Hz, the system sensitivity is about 1.3 nm/A and can measure the 50 Hz and 150 Hz frequency components of the leakage current accurately. However, it cannot measure the leakage current perfectly due to the complex frequency characteristics of leakage current. The proposed tension sensor has a system sensitivity of 0.054 nm/kN and exhibits good stability, linearity, and recovery.",

        "Abstract": "Stroke has been the leading cause of adult morbidity and mortality over the past several years. After an ischemic stroke attack, many dormant or reversibly injured brain cells exist in the penumbra area. However, the pathological processes and unique cell information in the penumbra area of an acute ischemic stroke remain elusive. We applied unbiased single cell sequencing in combination with bulk RNA-seq analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of each cell type in the early stages of ischemic stroke and to detect early possible therapeutic targets to help cell survival. We used these analyses to study the mouse brain penumbra during this phase. Our results reveal the impact of ischemic stroke on specific genes and pathways of different cell types and the alterations of cell differentiation trajectories, suggesting potential pathological mechanisms and therapeutic targets. In addition to classical gene markers, single-cell genomics demonstrates unique information on subclusters of several cell types and metabolism changes in an ischemic stroke. These findings suggest that ",

        "Abstract": "Pain sensitivity is highly variable among individuals, and it is clinically important to predict an individual's pain sensitivity for individualized diagnosis and management of pain. Literature has shown that pain sensitivity is associated with regional structural features of the brain, but it remains unclear whether pain sensitivity is also related to structural brain connectivity. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between pain thresholds and morphological connectivity (MC) inferred from structural MRI based on data of 221 healthy participants. We found that MC was highly predictive of an individual's pain thresholds and, importantly, it had a better prediction performance than regional structural features. We also identified a number of most predictive MC features and confirmed the crucial role of the prefrontal cortex in the determination of pain sensitivity. These results suggest the potential of using structural MRI-based MC to predict an individual's pain sensitivity in clinical settings, and hence this study has important implications for diagnosis and treatment of pain.",

However, no such studies on human oocytes have been reported. In this study, collected in vitro-matured human oocytes were randomly divided into the following groups: fresh group, MLT-treated cryopreservation (MC) group, and no-MLT-treated cryopreservation (NC) group. After vitrification and warming, viable oocytes from these three groups were assessed for their mitochondrial function, ultrastructure, permeability of oolemma, early apoptosis, developmental competence, and cryotolerance-related gene expression.

        "Abstract": "Using machine learning to predict the intensity of pain from fMRI has attracted rapidly increasing interests. However, due to remarkable inter- and intra-individual variabilities in pain responses, the performance of existing fMRI-based pain prediction models is far from satisfactory. The present study proposed a new approach which can design a prediction model specific to each individual or each experimental trial so that the specific model can achieve more accurate prediction of the intensity of nociceptive pain from single-trial fMRI responses. More precisely, the new approach uses a supervised k-means method on nociceptive-evoked fMRI responses to cluster individuals or trials into a set of subgroups, each of which has similar and consistent fMRI activation patterns. Then, for a new test individual/trial, the proposed approach chooses one subgroup of individuals/trials, which has the closest fMRI patterns to the test individual/trial, as training samples to train an individual-specific or a trial-specific pain prediction model. The new approach was tested on a nociceptive-evoked fMRI dataset and achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy than conventional non-specific models, which used all available training samples to train a model. The generalizability of the proposed approach is further validated by training specific models on one dataset and testing these models on an independent new dataset. This proposed individual-specific and trial-specific pain prediction approach has the potential to be used for the development of individualized and precise pain assessment tools in clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "Pain is a subjective experience and clinicians need to treat patients with accurate pain levels. EEG has emerged as a useful tool for objective pain assessment, but due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of pain-related EEG signals, the prediction accuracy of EEG-based pain prediction models is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we proposed an autoencoder model based on convolutional neural networks for feature extraction of pain-related EEG signals. More precisely, we used EEGNet to build an autoencoder model to extract a small set of features from high-density pain-evoked EEG potentials and then establish a machine learning models to predict pain levels (high pain vs. low pain) from extracted features. Experimental results show that the new autoencoder-based approach can effectively identify pain-related features and can achieve better classification results than conventional methods.",

        "Abstract": "Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has became the most popular method to remove eye-blinking artifacts from electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. For long term EEG recording, ICA was commonly considered to costing a lot of computation time. Furthermore, with no ground truth, the discussion about the quality of ICA decomposition in a nonstationary environment was specious. In this study, we investigated the \"signal\" (P300 waveform) and the \"noise\" (averaged eye-blinking artifacts) on a cross-modal long-term EEG recording to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of different methods on ICA eye-blinking artifacts removal. As a result, it was found that, firstly, down sampling is an effective way to reduce the computation time in ICA. Appropriate down sampling ratio could speed up ICA computation 200 times and keep the decomposition performance stable, in which the computation time of ICA decomposition on a 2800 s EEG recording was less than 5 s. Secondly, dimension reduction by PCA was also a way to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ICA. Finally, the comparison by cropping the dataset indicated that performing ICA on each run of the experiment separately would achieve a better result for eye-blinking artifacts removal than using all the EEG data input for ICA.",

        "Abstract": "The soot suppression by acoustic oscillations for acetylene diffusion flames was investigated combining numerical and experimental studies. The combustion and soot formation were predicted by the finite-rate detailed chemistry model and modified Moss-Brookes model, respectively, while the turbulence was predicted by the detached eddy simulation (DES) with a low Reynolds number correction. Experimental results showed that the soot rate almost decreased linearly with the amplitude of acoustic oscillation, and the pinch-off of the flame occurred at a large acoustic oscillation. Numerical results showed that the flame structure was well predicted, while the soot rate was over-predicted at large acoustic oscillations; the consumption of O",
