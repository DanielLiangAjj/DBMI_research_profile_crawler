        "Title": "Exploring the value of multiple preprocessors and classifiers in constructing models for predicting microsatellite instability status in colorectal cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Approximately 15% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibit a distinct molecular phenotype known as microsatellite instability (MSI). Accurate and non-invasive prediction of MSI status is crucial for cost savings and guiding clinical treatment strategies. The retrospective study enrolled 307 CRC patients between January 2020 and October 2022. Preoperative images of computed tomography and postoperative status of MSI information were available for analysis. The stratified fivefold cross-validation was used to avoid sample bias in grouping. Feature extraction and model construction were performed as follows: first, inter-/intra-correlation coefficients and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm were used to identify the most predictive feature subset. Subsequently, multiple discriminant models were constructed to explore and optimize the combination of six feature preprocessors (Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson, Max-Abs, Min-Max, Z-score, and Quantile) and three classifiers (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest). Selecting the one with the highest average value of the area under the curve (AUC) in the test set as the radiomics model, and the clinical screening model and combined model were also established using the same processing steps as the radiomics model. Finally, the performances of the three models were evaluated and analyzed using decision and correction curves.We observed that the logistic regression model based on the quantile preprocessor had the highest average AUC value in the discriminant models. Additionally, tumor location, the clinical of N stage, and hypertension were identified as independent clinical predictors of MSI status. In the test set, the clinical screening model demonstrated good predictive performance, with the average AUC of 0.762 (95% confidence interval, 0.635-0.890). Furthermore, the combined model showed excellent predictive performance (AUC, 0.958; accuracy, 0.899; sensitivity, 0.929) and favorable clinical applicability and correction effects. The logistic regression model based on the quantile preprocessor exhibited excellent performance and repeatability, which may further reduce the variability of input data and improve the model performance for predicting MSI status in CRC.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate and objective estimation of the postmortem interval (PMI) is crucial in forensic practice. This study aimed to infer PMI through equations based on the relationship between PMI and metabolomics biomarkers.Rats were subjected to models representing various temperatures and causes of death, with blood collected at different intervals. Untargeted gas chromatographymass spectrometry metabolomics detection methods were developed, and candidate biomarkers were chosen as co-differentially expressed metabolites in four models. A targeted method was then developed for quantitatively determining candidate biomarkers. Animal tests and human cadaver samples with clearly documented causes of death and time were used to verify the reliability of the regression equation.Results: Unique differential metabolites for CO poisoning deaths included 2,3-butanediol, hypoxanthine, and dehydrated hexanol, while those for mechanical asphyxia deaths comprised propylamine, 1,3-propylene glycol, phosphoric acid, and sorbitol. Pyruvate, glycerol and isoleucine were identified as candidate biomarkers. Human case results demonstrated the method's potential (error rate < 20 %). The findings of this study may offer reference points for estimating PMI and causes of death in forensic practice.",

        "Abstract": "Manipulating orthogonally polarized waves independently in a single metasurface is pivotal. However, independently controlling the phase shifts of orthogonally polarized waves is difficult, especially in the same frequency bands. Here, we propose a receiver-phase shift-transmitter transmitarray with independent control of arbitrary polarization states in the same frequency bands, in which transmission rates reach more than 90% in the frequency bands 4.2~4.9 GHz and 5.3~5.5 GHz. By introducing a phase-regulation structure to each element, phases covering 360° for different polarized incident waves can be independently controlled by different geometric parameters, and two-bit coding phases can be obtained. The design principle based on the two-port network's scattering matrix has been analyzed. To verify the independent tuning abilities of the proposed transmitarray for different polarization incidences in the same frequency bands, a multifunctional receive-phase shift-radiation coding transmitarray (RPRCT), which is composed of 16×16 elements, with functions of anomalous refraction (for example, orbital angular momentum wave) and focusing transmission for different polarized incident waves was simulated and measured. The measured results agree reasonably well with the simulated ones. Our findings provide a simple method for obtaining a multifunctional metasurface with orthogonal polarization in the same frequency bands, which greatly improves the capacity and spectral efficiency of communication channels.",

        "Abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is the main component of plant Cannabis (Cannabis sativa), which exhibits strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. With the legalization of CBD in the United States, it is an inevitable tendency for its global legalization in the future. Therefore, it has become an urgent task to conduct the toxicological evaluation of CBD before clinical application. In this study, the developmental toxicities of CBD on zebrafish embryos were systematically evaluated, and the mechanisms were revealed. The results showed that the phenotype of liver degeneration was observed in 96 hpf zebrafish embryos after 0.1-5 μmol/L CBD exposure, further RT-qPCR experiments indicated that the above result may attributed by the alterations of FABP10A, GCLC, and GSR. Besides, 1 and 5 μmol/L CBD contributed to the developmental toxicities of heart and eye in zebrafish embryos, characterizing by the decrease in heart rate, the phenotype of pericardial edema, and the reduce of eye area. Compared to other organs, the liver of zebrafish displayed the most sensitive characteristic to CBD exposure, as 0.1 μmol/L CBD already led to the phenotype of liver degeneration. In summary, this paper provided theoretical supports for CBD toxicology research, and laid the foundation for its future clinical application.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, identified as E3 ubiquitin ligases, participate in various viral infections through ubiquitylation, ISGylation, and SUMOylation processes. Respiratory viruses, particularly influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs), have severely threatened public health with high morbidity and mortality, causing incalculable losses. Research on the regulation of TRIM proteins in respiratory virus infections is crucial for disease prevention and control. This review introduces TRIM proteins, summarizes recent discoveries regarding their roles and molecular mechanisms in IAV and CoVs infections, discusses current research gaps, and explores potential future trends in this rapidly developing field. It aims to enhance understanding of virus-host interactions and inform the development of new molecularly targeted therapies.",

        "Abstract": "The utilization of acid as a synthesis assistant provides an effective means to regulate the structure of hydrogels, thereby simplifying the design and preparation process of multifunctional hydrogels. However, there remains a dearth of discourse concerning the utilization of this convenient acid-mediated strategy, which possesses the potential to directly govern molecular interactions within gel networks for rational structure and property design. Herein, we describe the preparation of flexible dual-network conductive hydrogels using polyacrylamide (PAM) and sodium alginate (SA) as substrates, driven by the strategy of acid-mediated (HCI, H",

        "Title": "Treatment of colorectal cancer by traditional Chinese medicine: prevention and treatment mechanisms.",
        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health burden, with high morbidity and mortality rates. It is often diagnosed at middle to advanced stage, affecting approximately 35% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Currently, chemotherapy has been used to improve patient prognosis and increase overall survival. However, chemotherapy can also have cytotoxic effects and lead to adverse reactions, such as inhibiting bone marrow hematopoiesis, causing digestive dysfunction, hand-foot syndrome, and even life-threatening conditions. In response to these adverse effects, researchers have proposed using Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as an option to treat cancer. TCM research focuses on prescriptions, herbs, and components, which form essential components of the current research in Chinese medicine. The study and implementation of TCM prescriptions and herbs demonstrate its distinctive holistic approach to therapy, characterized by applying multi-component and multi-target treatment. TMC components have advantages in developing new drugs as they consist of single ingredients, require smaller medication dosages, have a precise measure of pharmacodynamic effects, and have a clear mechanism of action compared to TCM prescriptions and herbs. However, further research is still needed to determine whether TMC components can fully substitute the therapeutic efficacy of TCM prescriptions. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the research advancements made in TCM prescriptions, herbs, and components. The findings of this study can serve as a theoretical basis for researchers who are interested in exploring the potential of TCM for the treatment of colorectal cancer.",

        "Abstract": "This study investigates abnormalities in cerebellar-cerebral static and dynamic functional connectivity among patients with acute pontine infarction, examining the relationship between these connectivity changes and behavioral dysfunction. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was utilized to collect data from 45 patients within seven days post-pontine infarction and 34 normal controls. Seed-based static and dynamic functional connectivity analyses identified divergences in cerebellar-cerebral connectivity features between pontine infarction patients and normal controls. Correlations between abnormal functional connectivity features and behavioral scores were explored. Compared to normal controls, left pontine infarction patients exhibited significantly increased static functional connectivity within the executive, affective-limbic, and motor networks. Conversely, right pontine infarction patients demonstrated decreased static functional connectivity in the executive, affective-limbic, and default mode networks, alongside an increase in the executive and motor networks. Decreased temporal variability of dynamic functional connectivity was observed in the executive and default mode networks among left pontine infarction patients. Furthermore, abnormalities in static and dynamic functional connectivity within the executive network correlated with motor and working memory performance in patients. These findings suggest that alterations in cerebellar-cerebral static and dynamic functional connectivity could underpin the behavioral dysfunctions observed in acute pontine infarction patients.",

        "Abstract": "Saline-alkali land， as one of the farmland problems that seriously threatens grain yield in the 21st century， is widely distributed and has great potential for development. Biochar is a relatively efficient novel soil amendment， which can play an important role in alleviating the soil acid-base barrier， soil pollution control， carbon sequestration， and fertilizer slow release and has a great prospect in promoting sustainable agricultural development. In recent years， the research and application of biochar to improve saline-alkali soil have attracted much attention. However， due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the structural components of biochar， the improvement effect of biochar on saline-alkali soil is highly uncertain， and there is also a lack of systematic summary and in-depth discussion of the key mechanisms， which limits the further popularization and application of biochar technology in the improvement of saline-alkali soil. This study comprehensively analyzed the effects of biochar on physicochemical properties， nutrient availability， and biological characteristics of saline-alkali soil； summarized the improvement effects of biochar and modified biochar on saline-alkali soil and their effects on quality and efficiency； and elucidated the possible mechanism of biochar in the improvement of saline-alkali soil. The future research prospect of biochar was discussed in order to provide reference for further research and development of green， efficient， and accurate improvement technology of biochar in saline-alkali soil and its popularization and application.",

Host-induced gene silencing of MgCRT1 reduced the infection ability of M. graminicola, while over-expressing MgCRT1 enhanced rice susceptibility to M. graminicola. A yeast two-hybrid approach identified the calmodulin-like protein OsCML31 as an interactor of MgCRT1. OsCML31 interacts with the high mobility group protein OsHMGB1 which is a conserved DNA binding protein. Knockout of OsCML31 or overexpression of OsHMGB1 in rice results in enhanced susceptibility to M. graminicola. In contrast, overexpression of OsCML31 or knockout of OsHMGB1 in rice decreases susceptibility to M. graminicola. The GST-pulldown and luciferase complementation imaging assay showed that MgCRT1 decreases the interaction of OsCML31 and OsHMGB1 in a competitive manner. In conclusion, when M. graminicola infects rice and secretes MgCRT1 into rice, MgCRT1 interacts with OsCML31 and decreases the association of OsCML31 with OsHMGB1, resulting in the release of OsHMGB1 to enhance rice susceptibility.",

        "Abstract": "Schizophrenia, a complex psychiatric disorder with diverse symptoms, has been linked to ketamine, known for its N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonistic properties. Understanding the distinct roles and mechanisms of ketamine is crucial, especially regarding its induction of schizophrenia-like symptoms. Recent research highlights the impact of ketamine on key brain regions associated with schizophrenia, specifically the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (Hip). This study focused on these regions to explore proteomic changes related to anxiety and cognitive impairment in a chronic ketamine-induced mouse model of schizophrenia. After twelve consecutive days of ketamine administration, brain tissues from these regions were dissected and analyzed. Using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling quantitative proteomics techniques, 34,797 and 46,740 peptides were identified in PFC and Hip, corresponding to 5,668 and 6,463 proteins, respectively. In the PFC, a total of 113 proteins showed differential expression, primarily associated with the immuno-inflammatory process, calmodulin, postsynaptic density protein, and mitochondrial function. In the Hip, 129 differentially expressed proteins were screened, mainly related to synaptic plasticity proteins and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex-associated proteins. Additionally, we investigated key proteins within the glutamatergic synapse pathway and observed decreased expression levels of phosphorylated CaMKII and CREB. Overall, the study unveiled a significant proteomic signature in the chronic ketamine-induced schizophrenia mouse model, characterized by anxiety and cognitive impairment in both the PFC and Hip, and this comprehensive proteomic dataset may not only enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine-related mental disorders but also offer valuable insights for future disease treatments.",

        "Abstract": "The difficulty of wound healing due to skin defects has been a great challenge due to the complex inflammatory microenvironment. Delayed wound healing severely affects the quality of life of patients and represents a significant economic burden for public health systems worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of novel wound dressings that can efficiently resist drug-resistant bacteria and have superior wound repair capabilities in clinical applications. In this study, we designed an adhesive antimicrobial hydrogel dressing (GMH) based on methacrylic-anhydride-modified gelatin and oxidized hyaluronic acid formed by Schiff base and UV-induced double cross-linking for infected wound repair. By inserting PDA nanoparticles into the hydrogel (GMH/PDA), the hydrogel has the capability of photothermal conversion and exhibits good photothermal antimicrobial properties under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation, which helps to reduce the inflammatory response and avoid bacterial infections during the wound healing process. In addition, GMH/PDA hydrogel exhibits excellent injectability, allowing the hydrogel dressings to be adapted to complex wound surfaces, making them promising candidates for wound therapy. In conclusion, the multifunctional injectable GMH/PDA hydrogel possesses high antimicrobial efficiency, antioxidant properties and good biocompatibility, making them promising candidates for the treatment of infected skin wounds.",

Nanotechnology is expected to enhance the effectiveness of conventional biostimulants. Herein, the current study constructed an efficient proline (Pro) nanodelivery system based on a star polyamine (SPc). The hydroxyl groups of Pro could assemble with carbonyl groups of SPc, and the self-assembly of Pro with SPc formed the nanoscale particles of the Pro/SPc complex. Compared to Pro alone, the contact angle of SPc-loaded Pro decreased, and its retentivity and plant uptake increased. Importantly, the tobacco (",

        "Abstract": "Sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus displays the typical circadian rhythms. This present study investigated the molecular regulation of clock genes, as well as monoamines and melatonin, in multiple tissues of A. japonicus, responding to the photoperiod. In order to determine their pivotal role in circadian rhythms, the crucial clock genes, namely AjClock, AjArnt1, AjCry1, and AjTimeless, were identified and a comprehensive analysis of their expressions across various tissues in adult A. japonicus was conducted, revealing the potential existence of central and peripheral oscillators. Results demonstrated that the tissues of polian vesicle and nerve ring exhibited significant clock gene expression associated with the orchestration of circadian regulation, and that environmental light fluctuations exerted influence on the expression of these clock genes. However, a number of genes, such as AjArnt1 and AjCry1, maintained their circadian rhythmicity even under continuous light conditions. Moreover, we further investigated the circadian patterns of melatonin (MT), serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine (DA) secretion in A. japonicus, data that underscored the tissue-specific regulatory differences and the inherent adaptability to dynamic light environments. Collectively, these findings will provide the molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm in echinoderms and the candidate tissues playing the role of central oscillators in sea cucumbers.",

        "Abstract": "Glioma, the predominant form of central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, presents a significant challenge due to its high prevalence and low 5-year survival rate. The efficacy of current treatment methods is limited by the presence of the blood-brain barrier, the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and other factors. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach, as it can overcome the blood-brain barrier. A tumor's immune privilege, which is induced by an immunosuppressive environment, constricts immunotherapy's clinical impact in glioma. Pyroptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism facilitated by gasdermins, plays a significant role in the management of glioma. Its ability to initiate and regulate tumor occurrence, progression, and metastasis is well-established. However, it is crucial to note that uncontrolled or excessive cell death can result in tissue damage, acute inflammation, and cytokine release syndrome, thereby potentially promoting tumor advancement or recurrence. This paper aims to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in pyroptosis and subsequently discuss its induction in cancer therapy. In addition, the current treatment methods of glioma and the use of pyroptosis in these treatments are introduced. It is hoped to provide more ideas for the treatment of glioma.",

        "Abstract": "The application of nanotechnology in agriculture can break through many traditional problems of synthetic pesticides, especially for increasing bioactivity and reducing application amount. However, the safety and selective toxicity of nanocarrier-loaded pesticides should be clarified toward natural predators. In this context, an efficient spirotetramat nanodelivery system was successfully constructed based on a star polymer (SPc). Spirotetramat could complex with SPc through hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces spontaneously. The self-assembly of the spirotetramat/SPc complex decreased the particle size of spirotetramat from 1292 to 710 nm. After the complexation with SPc, the lethal concentration 50 (LC",

        "Title": "FGAHOI: Fine-Grained Anchors for Human-Object Interaction Detection.",
        "Abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI), as an important problem in computer vision, requires locating the human-object pair and identifying the interactive relationships between them. The HOI instance has a greater span in spatial, scale, and task than the individual object instance, making its detection more susceptible to noisy backgrounds. To alleviate the disturbance of noisy backgrounds on HOI detection, it is necessary to consider the input image information to generate fine-grained anchors which are then leveraged to guide the detection of HOI instances. However, it has the following challenges. i) how to extract pivotal features from the images with complex background information is still an open question. ii) how to semantically align the extracted features and query embeddings is also a difficult issue. In this paper, a novel end-to-end transformer-based framework (FGAHOI) is proposed to alleviate the above problems. FGAHOI comprises three dedicated components namely, multi-scale sampling (MSS), hierarchical spatial-aware merging (HSAM) and task-aware merging mechanism (TAM). MSS extracts features of humans, objects and interaction areas from noisy backgrounds for HOI instances of various scales. HSAM and TAM semantically align and merge the extracted features and query embeddings in the hierarchical spatial and task perspectives in turn. In the meanwhile, a novel training strategy Stage-wise Training Strategy is designed to reduce the training pressure caused by overly complex tasks done by FGAHOI. In addition, we propose two ways to measure the difficulty of HOI detection and a novel dataset, i.e., HOI-SDC for the two challenges (Uneven Distributed Area in Human-Object Pairs and Long Distance Visual Modeling of Human-Object Pairs) of HOI instances detection. Experiments are conducted on three benchmarks: HICO-DET, HOI-SDC and V-COCO. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art HOI detection methods, and the extensive ablations reveal the merits of our proposed contribution.",

        "Abstract": "To meet the increasing needs of point-of-care testing in clinical diagnosis and daily health monitoring, numerous cutting-edge techniques have emerged to upgrade current portable biosensors with higher sensitivity, smaller size, and better intelligence. In particular, due to the controlled locomotion characteristics in the micro/nano scale, microrobots can effectively enhance the sensitivity of biosensors by disrupting conventional passive diffusion into an active enrichment during the test. In addition, microrobots are ideal to create biosensors with functions of on-demand delivery, transportation, and multi-objective detections with the capability of actively controlled motion. In this review, five types of portable biosensors and their integration with microrobots are critically introduced. Microrobots can enhance the detection signal in fluorescence intensity and surface-enhanced Raman scattering detection via the active enrichment. The existence and quantity of detection substances also affect the motion state of microrobots for the locomotion-based detection. In addition, microrobots realize the indirect detection of the bio-molecules by functionalizing their surfaces in the electrochemical current and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy detections. We pay a special focus on the roles of microrobots with active locomotion to enhance the detection performance of portable sensors. At last, perspectives and future trends of microrobots in biosensing are also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Short peptides have gained widespread utilization as functional constituents in the development of functional foods due to their remarkable biological activity. Previous investigations have established the positive influence of oysters on testosterone biosynthesis, although the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study aims to assess the impact of three dipeptides derived from oysters on the oxidative stress state of TM3 cells induced by AAPH while concurrently examining alterations in cellular testosterone biosynthesis capacity. The investigation encompasses an analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, antioxidant enzyme activity, apoptotic status, and expression levels of crucial enzymes involved in the testosterone synthesis pathway within TM3 cells, thus evaluating the physiological activity of the three dipeptides. Additionally, molecular docking was employed to investigate the inhibitory activity of the three dipeptides against ACE. The outcomes of this study imply that the oxidative stress state of cells impedes the synthesis of testosterone by inhibiting the expression of essential proteins in the testosterone synthesis pathway. These three dipeptides derived from oysters ameliorate cellular oxidative stress by directly scavenging excess ROS or reducing ROS production rather than enhancing cellular antioxidant capacity through modulation of antioxidant enzyme activity. These findings introduce a novel avenue for developing and utilizing antioxidant peptides derived from food sources.",

        "Abstract": "The sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus is an economically important marine species in China, and understanding the mechanisms underlying its gonad development is crucial for successful reproduction and breeding. In this study, we performed transcriptome comparisons and analyses of A. japonicus gonadal and non-gonadal tissues to identify genes and molecular pathways associated with gonadal development. We also supplemented the annotation of the A. japonicus genome. Collectively, results revealed a total of 941 ovary-specific genes and 2499 testis-specific genes through different expression analysis and WGCNA analysis. The most enriched pathways in ovary and testis were \"DNA replication\" and \"purine metabolism\", respectively. Additionally, we identified key candidate gene modules that control gonad development and germ cell maturation, with CDT1 and DYNC2LI1 serving as hub genes. Our findings provide important insights into the gonadal development system of A. japonicus and offer valuable references for further research on reproductive biology in this marine invertebrate species.",

        "Abstract": "High-performance zeolite-supported noble metal catalysts with low loading and high dispersion of active components are the most promising materials for achieving the complete oxidation of formaldehyde (HCHO) at room temperature. In this work, palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) with different sizes were successfully encapsulated inside the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite framework by using diverse stabling ligands via the one-pot method. Thereafter, the rule on selecting the coordinative ligands for palladium was clarified: more N atoms, a short carbon chain, a smaller branch chain, and bidentate coordination are characteristics of an ideal ligand. Accordingly, the best-performing 0.2Pd@S-1(Ethylenediamine) catalyst exhibited outstanding performance for HCHO oxidation, achieving 100% conversion even at room temperature. High-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR HAADF-STEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the chelate is formed by complexation of Pd",

The absence of effective vaccines and therapeutics amplifies the urgency to deepen our comprehension of PRRSV's intricate pathogenic mechanisms. Previous transcriptomic studies, although informative, are partially constrained by their predominant reliance on in vitro models or lack of long-term infections. Moreover, the role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) during PRRSV invasion is yet to be elucidated.",

        "Abstract": "Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), which are a critical component of viperid and crotalid venoms, play various important roles in the pathogenesis of snakebite envenomation. The SVMPs from elapid venoms are not well elucidated, as compared with those from viperid and crotalid venoms. Atrase A is a nonhemorrhagic P-III SVMP purified from Naja atra venom that possesses only weak fibrinogenolytic activity. In our prior study, we found that atrase A detached adherent cells from the substrate. In this work, we investigated further the effect and mechanism of atrase A on endothelial cells. Oxidative damage, inflammatory mediators, apoptosis, and activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways were measured after HMEC-1 cells were exposed to atrase A. The results showed that HMEC-1 cells released inflammatory mediators, exihibited oxidative damage and apoptosis after exposure to atrase A. The Western blot analysis results revealed that atrase A increased Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3 levels and activated the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways in endothelial cells. The effects on endothelial cells were nearly completely abolished after atrase A was treated with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. These results showed that atrase A led to an inflammatory response, cellular injury and apoptosis in endothelial cells, and this effect was due to its metalloproteinase domain. The study contributes to a better understanding of the structures and functions of cobra venom P-III class metalloproteinases.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for biomarkers important for clinical phenotypes can lead to clinically relevant discoveries. GWAS for quantitative traits are based on simplified regression models modeling the conditional mean of a phenotype as a linear function of genotype. An alternative and easy to apply approach is quantile regression that naturally extends linear regression to the analysis of the entire conditional distribution of a phenotype of interest by modeling conditional quantiles within a regression framework. Quantile regression can be applied efficiently at biobank scale using standard statistical packages in much the same way as linear regression, while having some unique advantages such as identifying variants with heterogeneous effects across different quantiles, including non-additive effects and variants involved in gene-environment interactions; accommodating a wide range of phenotype distributions with invariance to trait transformation; and overall providing more detailed information about the underlying genotype-phenotype associations. Here, we demonstrate the value of quantile regression in the context of GWAS by applying it to 39 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank (",

        "Title": "Altered resting-state neurovascular coupling in patients with pontine infarction.",
        "Abstract": "The risk for motor and cognitive impairment is increased in patients with chronic pontine infarction (PI). In this study, we attempted to explore the alterations of neurovascular coupling (NVC) in order to understand the neural basis of behavioral impairment after PI. Three-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (3D-pcASL) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) were applied in 49 patients with unilateral PI (left-sided, n = 26; right-sided, n = 23) and 30 matched normal subjects to assess whole-brain cerebral blood flow (CBF) and functional connectivity strength (FCS). We evaluated NVC in each subject by calculating the correlation coefficient between the whole-brain CBF and FCS (CBF-FCS coupling) and the ratio between voxel-wise CBF and FCS (CBF/FCS ratio). The FCS maps were then divided into long-range and short-range FCS to identify the influence of connection distance. The results indicated that the CBF-FCS coupling in the whole-brain level was significantly interrupted in PI patients, and the CBF/FCS ratio in cognition-related brain regions was abnormal. Distance-dependent results demonstrated that PI had a more serious effect on long-range neurovascular coupling. Correlation analysis revealed that the changes in neurovascular coupling were correlated with working memory scores. These findings imply that disruption of neurovascular coupling in the remote-infarction brain regions may underlie the impaired cognitive functions in chronic PI.",

        "Title": "Irrigating degradation properties of silk fibroin-collagen type II composite cartilage scaffold in vitro and in vivo.",
        "Abstract": "Silk fibroin-collagen type II scaffolds are promising in cartilage tissue engineering due to their suitable biological functionality to promote proliferation of chondrocytes in vitro. However, their degradation properties, which are of crucial importance as scaffold degradation should consistent with the new tissue formation process, are still unknown. In this study, degradability of silk fibroin-collagen type II cartilage scaffolds was probed both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro degradation experiments show that the scaffolds decreased 32.25 % ± 0.62 %, 34.27 % ± 0.96 %, 36.27 % ± 2.39 % in weight after 8 weeks of degradation at the irrigation velocity of 0 mL/min, 7.89 mL/min and 15.79 mL/min. The degradation ratio, which increases with time and increasing irrigation velocity, is described by combining the built mathematic model and finite element modeling method. The scaffolds after 8 weeks of degradation in vitro keep their mechanical structural integrity to support new tissues. In vivo degradation experiments conducted in rabbits further show that the scaffolds degrade gradually, be absorbed with time and finally collapse in structure. The degradation process is accompanied by the growth of fibrous tissues and the scaffold is filled by fibrous tissues after 12 weeks of implantation. Immunohistology analysis shows that the inflammation caused by scaffolds is controllable and gradually alleviates with time. To sum up, silk fibroin-collagen type II cartilage scaffolds, which show suitable mechanical properties and biocompatibility during degradation in vitro and in vivo, have great potential in cartilage repair. The novelty of the study is that it not only introduces a mathematical model to predict the irrigation degradation ratio, but also provides experimental degradation data support for clinical application of silk fibroin-collagen type II cartilage scaffolds.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have long been sought as therapeutic targets for EOC, as they are frequently hyperactivated in primary tumors and drive disease relapse, progression, and metastasis. More recently, these oncogenic drivers have been implicated in EOC response to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and epigenome-interfering agents. This evidence revives RTKs as promising targets for therapeutic intervention of EOC. This review summarizes recent studies on the role of RTKs in EOC malignancy and the use of their inhibitors for clinical treatment. Our focus is on the ERBB family, c-Met, and VEGFR, as they are linked to drug resistance and targetable using commercially available drugs. The importance of these RTKs and their inhibitors is highlighted by their impact on signal transduction and intratumoral heterogeneity in EOC and successful use as maintenance therapy in the clinic through suppression of the VEGF/VEGFR axis. Finally, the therapeutic potential of RTK inhibitors is discussed in the context of combinatorial targeting via co-inhibiting proliferative and anti-apoptotic pathways, epigenomic/transcriptional programs, and harnessing the efficacy of PARP inhibitors and programmed cell death 1/ligand 1 immune checkpoint therapies.",

        "Abstract": "The complexity of periodontitis, including the complex formation mechanisms and the complex periodontium physiological environment, as well as the complex association with multiple complications, often results in poor therapy effects. Herein, we aimed to design a nanosystem with a controlled release of minocycline hydrochloride (MH) and good retention to effectively treat periodontitis by inhibiting inflammation and repairing the alveolar bone. Firstly, insoluble ion-pairing (IIP) complexes were constructed to improve the encapsulation efficiency of hydrophilic MH in PLGA nanoparticles. Then, a nanogenerator was constructed and combined with a double emulsion method to encapsulate the complexes into PLGA nanoparticles (MH-NPs). The average particle size of MH-NPs was about 100 nm as observed by AFM and TEM, and the drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were 9.59% and 95.58%, respectively. Finally, a multifunctional system (MH-NPs-in-gels) was prepared by dispersing MH-NPs into thermosensitive gels, which could continue to release drug for 21 days in vitro. And the release mechanism showed that this controlled release behavior for MH was influenced by the insoluble ion-pairing complex, PLGA nanoparticles, and gels. In addition, the periodontitis rat model was established to investigate the pharmacodynamic effects. After 4 weeks of treatment, changes in the alveolar bone were assessed by Micro-CT (BV/TV: 70.88%; BMD: 0.97 g/cm",

        "Abstract": "The main development process of periodontitis involves periodontal pathogenic bacteria as the initiating factor causing the onset of destructive inflammation, which in turn stimulates the destruction of periodontal tissue. It is difficult to achieve the eradication of periodontitis due to the complex interaction among antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and bone restoration. Herein, we propose an antibacterial-anti-inflammatory-bone restoration procedural treatment strategy with minocycline (MIN) for the efficient treatment of periodontitis. In brief, MIN was prepared into PLGA microspheres with tunable release behavior using different species of PLGA, respectively. The optimally selected PLGA microspheres (LA:GA with 50:50, 10 kDa, and carboxyl group) had a drug loading of 16.91%, an in vitro release of approximately 30 days, which also had a particle size of approximately 11.8 µm with a smooth appearance and a rounded morphology. The DSC and XRD results showed that the MIN was completely encapsulated in the microspheres as an amorphous state. Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated the safety and biocompatibility of the microspheres (cell viabilities at a concentration of 1-200 μg/mL were greater than 97%), and in vitro bacterial inhibition tests showed that the selected microspheres could achieve effective bacterial inhibition at the initial stage after administration. The favorable anti-inflammatory (low TNF-α and IL-10 levels) and bone restoration effects (BV/TV: 71.8869%; BMD: 0.9782 g/cm",

        "Abstract": "Identifying a patient's disease/health status from electronic medical records is a frequently encountered task in electronic health records (EHR) related research, and estimation of a classification model often requires a benchmark training data with patients' known phenotype statuses. However, assessing a patient's phenotype is costly and labor intensive, hence a proper selection of EHR records as a training set is desired. We propose a procedure to tailor the best training subsample with limited sample size for a classification model, minimizing its mean-squared phenotyping/classification error (MSE). Our approach incorporates \"positive only\" information, an approximation of the true disease status without false alarm, when it is available. In addition, our sampling procedure is applicable for training a chosen classification model which can be misspecified. We provide theoretical justification on its optimality in terms of MSE. The performance gain from our method is illustrated through simulation and a real-data example, and is found often satisfactory under criteria beyond MSE.",

        "Abstract": "As an essential structural, metabolic and signaling element, calcium shows low remobilization from old to young tissues in plants, restricting the nutrient-use efficiency and control efficacy against mosaic virus disease. Nanotechnology has been applied to prevent/minimize nutrient losses and improve the accessibility of poorly-available nutrients. Herein, the current study applied a star polycation (SPc) to prepare a calcium nutrition nanoagent. The SPc could assemble with calcium glycinate through hydrogen bond and Van der Waals force, forming stable spherical particles with nanoscale size (17.72 nm). Transcriptomic results revealed that the calcium glycinate/SPc complex could activate the expression of many transport-related genes and disease resistance genes in tomatoes, suggesting the enhanced transport and antiviral immunity of SPc-loaded calcium glycinate. Reasonably, the calcium transport was accelerated by 3.17 times into tomato leaves with the help of SPc, and the protective effect of calcium glycinate was remarkably improved to 77.40% and 67.31% toward tomato mosaic virus with the help of SPc after the third and fifth applications. Furthermore, SPc-loaded calcium glycinate could be applied to increase the leaf photosynthetic rate and control the unusual fast growth of tomatoes. The current study is the first success to apply nano-delivery system for enhanced calcium transport and antiviral immunity, which is beneficial for increasing nutrient-use efficiency and shows good prospects for field application.",

        "Abstract": "Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are highly specialized neural cells with several functions essential for vision. Progressive deterioration of RPE cells in elderly individuals can result in visual impairment and, ultimately, blinding disease. While human embryonic stem cell-derived RPE cell (hESC-RPE) growth conditions are generally harsher than those of cell lines, the subretinal transplantation of hESC-RPE is being clinically explored as a strategy to recover the damaged retina and improve vision. The cell-adhesion ability of the support is required for RPE transplantation, where pre-polarized cells can maintain specific functions on the scaffold. This work examined four typical biodegradable hydrogels as supports for hESC-RPE growth.",

        "Title": "Learning to segment subcortical structures from noisy annotations with a novel uncertainty-reliability aware learning framework.",
        "Abstract": "Accurate segmentation of subcortical structures is an important task in quantitative brain image analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable results in medical image segmentation. However, due to the difficulty of acquiring high-quality annotations of brain subcortical structures, learning segmentation networks using noisy annotations is an inevitable topic. A common practice is to select images or pixels with reliable annotations for training, which usually may not make full use of the information from the training samples, thus affecting the performance of the learned segmentation model. To address the above problem, in this work, we propose a novel robust learning method and denote it as uncertainty-reliability awareness learning (URAL), which can make sufficient use of all training pixels. At each training iteration, the proposed method first selects training pixels with reliable annotations from the set of pixels with uncertain network prediction, by utilizing a small clean validation set following a meta-learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we propose the online prototypical soft label correction (PSLC) method to estimate the pseudo-labels of label-unreliable pixels. Then, the segmentation loss of label-reliable pixels and the semi-supervised segmentation loss of label-unreliable pixels are used to calibrate the total segmentation loss. Finally, we propose a category-wise contrastive regularization to learn compact feature representations of all uncertain training pixels. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two publicly available brain MRI datasets. The proposed method achieves the best Dice scores and MHD values on both datasets compared to several recent state-of-the-art methods under all label noise settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/neulxlx/URAL.",

        "Abstract": "Conductive silver paste is a key material in the fields of printed circuits and printed electronic devices. However, the preparation of conductive silver paste with low-cost and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is still a challenge. In this work, conductive silver pastes with excellent comprehensive performances were developed by using water-borne polyurethane (WPU) as the bonding phase and using the ternary mixture of Ag microflakes (Ag MFs), Ag nanowires (Ag NWs), and Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as the conductive phase. WPU endowed conductive silver pastes with the adhesion along with releasing a few VOCs during the curing. Results showed that a small amount of Ag NPs or Ag NWs dramatically enhanced the electrical conductivity of silver paste paint film filled only with Ag MFs. The electrical resistivity for optimal ternary mixture conductive silver paste was 0.2 × 10",

Many studies have suggested that the brain's left-right asymmetry is one of the possible diagnostic landmarks for AD. However, most published approaches to classification problems may not adequately explore the asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres. At the same time, the relationship between asymmetry traits and other classifier features remains understudied.",

        "Abstract": "The microstructure of materials importantly affects their performance. As electrocatalyst materials, the performance of hollow-structure materials is usually better than that of solid materials because of the larger specific surface area, lower density, and more exposed active sites of hollow structure. Bimetallic catalysts usually exhibit better catalytic activity than monometallic catalysts because of the synergistic effects between different metal elements. Prussian blue and its analogues (PB/PBAs) are ideal precursors for preparing hollow-structure bimetallic catalysts due to their structure and composition characteristics. In this study, ZIF-67 hollow sphere (HS) was used as the template to prepare hierarchical hollow CoFePBA (H-SCP) through anion-exchange method. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance of H-SCP was further improved by low-temperature heat treatment in N",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a design method for frequency response masking (FRM)-based nonuniform filter bank with reduced effective wordlength. Instead of designing prototype filters separately, we propose to model the filter bank design problem as a nonlinear programming problem and jointly design the prototype filters in the FRM structure. Moreover, in this work, all the filters are designed directly in the finite wordlength space, such that they can be directly implemented using efficient fixed-point arithmetic without any quantization. By simultaneously considering all the subband constraints during optimization, the proposed method is able to guarantee the desirable stopband attenuation for all subbands and achieve optimal effective wordlength (EWL) for the coefficients, reducing the hardware complexity for very large-scale integration (VLSI) implementation. Experimental results show that the hardware complexity of filter banks can be reduced without sacrificing the audiogram compensation performance for hearing aid applications.",

The method is flexible enough to depict complex and nonlinear associations between the covariates and the quantiles of the outcome. We establish the theoretical properties of the estimated quantiles, and develop inference tools to assess the quantile effects. Extensive simulation studies indicate that the novel method generally outperforms existing zero-inflated approaches and the direct quantile regression in terms of the estimation and inference of the heterogeneous effect of the covariates. The approach is applied to data from the Northern Manhattan Study to identify risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis, measured by the ultrasound carotid plaque burden.",

        "Abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on individuals' mental health. This study aimed to investigate how negative emotions toward the COVID-19 pandemic, including feeling anxious, depressed, upset, and stressed, were associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Sweden. The study is a cross-sectional online survey conducted between 21-28 May 2021, using three nested hierarchical logistic regression models to assess the association. The study included 965 unvaccinated individuals, 51.2% (n = 494) of whom reported their intention to get vaccinated. We observed graded positive associations between reported negative emotions and vaccine acceptance. Individuals who experienced economic stress had lower odds of vaccine acceptance while having a positive opinion of the government's response to COVID-19 was associated with higher odds of being vaccine-acceptant. In conclusion, unvaccinated individuals experiencing negative emotions about the pandemic were more willing to get the vaccine. On the contrary, those with a negative opinion about the government's response, and those that had experienced economic stress were less likely to accept the immunization.",

        "Abstract": "Whole-organ transcriptomic analyses have emerged as a common method for characterizing developmental transitions in mammalian organs. However, it is unclear if all cell types in an organ follow the whole-organ defined developmental trajectory. Recently, a postnatal two-stage developmental process was described for the mouse stomach. Here, using laser capture microdissection to obtain in situ transcriptomic data, we show that mouse gastric pit cells exhibit four postnatal developmental stages. Interestingly, early stages are characterized by the up-regulation of genes associated with metabolism, a functionality not typically associated with pit cells. Hence, beyond revealing that not all constituent cells develop according to the whole-organ determined pathway, these results broaden our understanding of the pit cell phenotypic landscape during stomach development.",

        "Abstract": "Estrogen substances in the environment are increasing dramatically, which interfere with the normal hormone level of human body, lead to the disorder of endocrine system and even cancer. It is difficult to screen a large number of environmental estrogen substances by existing estrogen effect detection methods, and the results are often affected by many factors, thus the development of new method has become an urgent task. Electrochemical method is promising to reflect cell proliferation by tracking intracellular purine bases directly. In this study, the estrogen level in MCF-7 cells on multiwall carbon nanotubes modified glassy carbon electrode (MWCNTs/GCE) could be tracked simply and conveniently, and the estrogen effect of estradiol could be reflected by electrochemistry in time and dose-dependent manners. Electrochemical method displayed the best tolerance to culture factors, such as different cell densities, serum types, culture medium types and serum estrogen-free methods, which responsed to estrogen effect higher than MTT (about 40%) and cell counting methods (about 50%). Further Western blotting analysis showed that the estrogen effect of estradiol promoted purine catabolism and up-regulated guanine deaminase (GDA) and adenine deaminase (ADA) expression, the key enzymes of purine catabolism pathway, in a dose-dependent manner. The up-regulation of GDA and ADA led to the increase of intracellular guanine and xanthine, which enhanced the electrochemical signal derived from guanine and xanthine.",

It is of great importance to establish new methods to evaluate the estrogen effect of heavy metals from multiple angles due to the complex mechanism of estrogen effect.

The two electrochemical signals of MCF-7 cells derived from uric acid (0.30 V) and the mixture of guanine and xanthine (0.68 V) increased in a time and dose-dependent manner when MCF-7 cells induced by Cd, reaching the maximum at 96 h and 10",

        "Abstract": "Alcohol can cause injury and lead to an inflammatory response in the liver. The NF-κB/AMPK signaling pathway plays a vital role in regulating intracellular inflammatory cytokine levels. In this study, corn oligopeptides (CPs), as the research objects, were obtained from corn gluten meal, and their regulation of the activation of the Kupffer cell NF-κB/AMPK signal pathway induced by LPS was investigated. Results showed that ALT, AST, and inflammatory cytokines in mice serum after the administration of CPs at 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/kg of body weight displayed a distinct (p < 0.05) reduction. On the other hand, the CPs also inhibited the expression of recognized receptor CD14 and TLR4, down-regulated P-JNK, P-ERK, and P-p-38, and thus inhibited inflammatory cytokine levels in Kupffer cells (KCs). Furthermore, four kinds of dipeptides with a leucine residue at the C-terminus that might exhibit down-regulated inflammatory cytokines in the NF-κB/AMPK signaling pathway functions were detected using HPLC-MS/MS. These results indicated that CPs have a potential application value in acute alcoholic liver disease.",

        "Abstract": "Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). We have shown that ketamine can induce cognitive impairments and schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice. However, the detailed metabolic profile changes in the progression of ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like symptoms are still not fully elucidated. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry-based untargeted hippocampus high-throughput metabolomics method was first performed to screen for potential biomarkers in a schizophrenia-like state in a chronically administered ketamine-induced mouse model. Our results identified that the amino acid and energy metabolism pathways were significantly affected in mouse models of ketamine-induced schizophrenia. The detailed amino acid profiles were subsequently quantified in the hippocampus. The results showed that ketamine dramatically decreased the Lys, Gly, and Ser levels while significantly increasing the Gln level and relative Glu-to-GABA ratio. Our study suggested that Gln, Gly and Ser metabolism disturbances might be involved in ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like phenotypes. This research offers a fresh viewpoint for creating new neuroleptic medications and contributes to understanding the mechanisms underlying ketamine-induced schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "Automatic brain structure segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) plays an important role in the diagnosis of various neuropsychiatric diseases. However, most existing methods yield unsatisfactory results due to blurred boundaries and complex structures. Improving the segmentation ability requires the model to be explicit about the spatial localization and shape appearance of targets, which correspond to the low-frequency content features and the high-frequency edge features, respectively. Therefore, in this paper, to extract rich edge and content feature representations, we focus on the composition of the feature and utilize a frequency decoupling (FD) block to separate the low-frequency and high-frequency parts of the feature. Further, a novel edge-aware network (EA-Net) is proposed for jointly learning to segment brain structures and detect object edges. First, an encoder-decoder sub-network is utilized to obtain multi-level information from the input MRI, which is then sent to the FD block to complete the frequency separation. Further, we use different mechanisms to optimize both the low-frequency and high-frequency features. Finally, these two parts are fused to generate the final prediction. In particular, we extract the content mask and the edge mask from the optimization feature with different supervisions, which forces the network to learn the boundary features of the object. Extensive experiments are performed on two public brain MRI T1 scan datasets (the IBSR dataset and the MALC dataset) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experiments show that the EA-Net achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, and improves the segmentation DSC score by 1.31% at most compared with the U-Net model and its variants. Moreover, we evaluate the EA-Net under different noise disturbances, and the results demonstrate the robustness and superiority of our method under low-quality noisy MRI. Code is available at https://github.com/huqian999/EA-Net.",

        "Title": "Ferroptosis, novel therapeutics in asthma.",
        "Abstract": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, was recently demonstrated to be closely associated with the immune system. Regulators of ferroptosis may be the cells and secretions of the immune system. Ferroptosis has contributed to the progression of various diseases, namely, cancer, ischemia, and degenerative diseases. However, research on the relationship between ferroptosis and asthma remains fragmented. Non-immune cells associated with asthma are also closely associated with ferroptosis. Further studies on cross-linking asthma inflammation with ferroptosis signaling pathways could help identify several key molecules, known as ferroptosis regulators, that regulate asthma. Ferroptosis provides a new perspective to interpret and understand the manifestations of asthma, potential drug discovery targets, and new therapeutic options to effectively intervene in the imbalance caused by abnormal inflammation in asthma. Thus, the pathogenesis of ferroptosis and its contribution to the pathogenesis of asthma is essential in deepening the understanding and improving the prognosis and cure rate of the patients. Herein, we introduce the main molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis and asthma, describe the relationship between ferroptosis and asthma based on their common regulatory cells or molecules, and discuss potential drug discovery targets and therapeutic applications of ferroptosis in the context of immunomodulation and symptom alleviation.",

        "Abstract": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most commonly inherited metabolic disease and has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Patients with FH usually present with high levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, xanthomas and early coronary artery disease. Children with FH are subject to developing early and enhanced atherosclerosis, leading to an increased risk of coronary events. We report here an 8-year-old patient with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who was diagnosed with homozygous FH (HoFH) due to mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene and subsequently treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) after filtration plasma. To the best of our knowledge, this patient is the youngest case of HoFH treated with filtration plasma followed by PTCA reported to date.",

        "Abstract": "Uncontrolled growth, distant metastasis and chemoresistance are critical characteristics of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and they result in high mortality; however, the mechanisms triggering these effects have not been fully investigated. In this study, we analysed a dataset in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified PCDH1, a rarely studied transmembrane protein, as a novel prognostic marker in PDAC patients. We demonstrated that PCDH1 expression was upregulated in PDAC tissues, and its expression levels were associated with the depth of tumour invasion and lymph node metastasis. Patients with high PCDH1 levels showed poor overall survival (OS). We also investigated the biological significance of PCDH1 in PDAC cell growth, metastasis, and side population (SP) phenotype acquisition and explored the internal molecular mechanisms of PCDH1 action. Our results demonstrated that PCDH1 enhanced p65 nuclear localization by interacting with KPNB1, a well-characterized nuclear transporter, thereby activating the NF-κB signalling pathway and increasing its functional effects during PDAC progression. Hence, our results indicate that PCDH1 can be used as a negative prognostic marker and may be a potential therapeutic target for PDAC patients.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been growing enthusiasm for using electronic medical records (EMRs) for biomedical research. Quantile regression estimates distributional associations, providing unique insights into the intricacies and heterogeneity of the EMR data. However, the widespread nonignorable missing observations in EMR often obscure the true associations and challenge its potential for robust biomedical discoveries. We propose a novel method to estimate the covariate effects in the presence of nonignorable missing responses under quantile regression. This method imposes no parametric specifications on response distributions, which subtly uses implicit distributions induced by the corresponding quantile regression models. We show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. We also provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the proposed estimate and a randomly weighted bootstrap approach for statistical inferences. Numerical studies, including an empirical analysis of real-world EMR data, are used to assess the proposed method's finite-sample performance compared to existing literature.",

        "Title": "Astrocyte Activation, but not Microglia, Is Associated with the Experimental Mouse Model of Schizophrenia Induced by Chronic Ketamine.",
        "Abstract": "Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Many experimental studies have shown that ketamine can induce cognitive impairments and schizophrenia-like symptoms. While much data have demonstrated that glial cells are associated with the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, the response of glial cells to ketamine and its significance to schizophrenia are not clear. The present study was intended to explore whether chronic ketamine treatment would induce behavioral and glial changes in mice. First, ketamine was used to stimulate behavioral abnormalities similar to schizophrenia evaluated by the open field test, elevated plus-maze test, Y maze test, novel object recognition test, and tail suspension test. Secondly, histopathology and Nissl staining were performed. Meanwhile, immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the expression levels of IBA-1 (a microglial marker) and GFAP (an astrocyte marker) in the mouse hippocampus for any change. Then, ELISA was used to analyze proinflammatory cytokine levels for any change. Our results showed that ketamine (25 mg/kg, i.p., qid, 12 days) induced anxiety, recognition deficits, and neuronal injury in the hippocampus. Moreover, chronic ketamine treatment enhanced GFAP expression in CA1 and DG regions of the hippocampus but did not influence the expression of IBA-1. Ketamine also increased the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the mouse hippocampus. Our study created a new procedure for ketamine administration, which successfully induce negative symptoms and cognitive-behavioral defects in schizophrenia by chronic ketamine. This study further revealed that an increase in astrocytosis, but not microglia, is associated with the mouse model of schizophrenia caused by ketamine. In summary, hippocampal astrocytes may be involved in the pathophysiology of ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like phenotypes through reactive transformation and regulation of neuroinflammation.",

Aimed at the cysteine (Cys) receptor on the surface of the Golgi apparatus, ligand-directed carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were synthesized for Golgi apparatus-targeting imaging. In order to reduce the interference of tissue self-fluorescence and enhance the tissue penetration depth, orange-emissive levorotatory CQDs (L-CQDs) with Golgi apparatus-targeting ability were synthesized using the strategy of inheriting Cys residues and the inherent conjugated electronic structure of neutral red. They exhibit excitation-dependent, fluorescence stability, rich surface Cys residues, excellent biocompatibility, and low toxicity. As a Golgi apparatus-targeting agent, L-CQDs can quickly enter cells for Golgi apparatus-targeting imaging, and can also penetrate through biological tissue for imaging ",

        "Abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction in patients with infratentorial stroke has been paid little attention. Brainstem stroke may disrupt network connectivity across the whole brain and affect multidomain cognition, but the details of this process remain unclear. The study aimed to investigate the effects of stroke-induced pontine injury on whole-brain network connectivity and cognitive function. We included 47 patients with pontine stroke and 56 healthy comparisons (HC), who underwent cognitive tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Seven meaningful brain networks were identified using independent component analysis (ICA). Patients with pontine stroke had decreased intra-network functional connectivities (FCs) in the primary perceptual and higher cognitive control networks, including sensorimotor network (SMN), visual network (VIS), default mode network (DMN), and salience network (SAN), as well as decreased inter-network FCs in the primary perceptual (VIS-SMN) and higher cognitive control networks (bilateral frontoparietal networks, rFPN-lFPN). While the FCs between the primary perceptual and higher cognitive control networks (VIS-DMN, VIS-rFPN, VIS-lFPN) were increased. Furthermore, the alterations in these FCs correlated with patients' cognitive measurements. These findings suggested that the infratentorial stroke can induce dysfunctional connectivity in both primary perceptual and higher cognitive control networks at the whole-brain level, which may be attributable to the neural substrates of multidomain cognitive deficits in these patients.",

        "Abstract": "Background Microwave ablation (MWA) has attracted interest as a minimally invasive treatment for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, comparisons between MWA and surgical resection (SR) in the management of T1N0M0 PTC are rare. Purpose To compare the technical effectiveness, disease progression, and complications of MWA and SR for solitary T1N0M0 PTC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a single center. A total of 1029 patients with T1N0M0 PTC treated with either MWA or SR from January 2015 to May 2021 were studied and divided into two groups according to treatment modality. Propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to control for confounding factors. Disease progression was analyzed in T1N0M0 PTCs as well as T1a and T1b subgroups by using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results A total of 404 patients (mean age, 43 years ± 12 [SD]; 289 women; 337 with T1a PTC) underwent MWA, and 625 (mean age, 46 years ± 12; 495 women; 521 with T1a PTC) underwent SR. During the follow-up (median, 25 months; IQR, 7-61 months), there was no evidence of differences regarding disease progression in T1N0M0 (4.0% vs 4.0%; ",

        "Abstract": "The use of Ge as framework atom to direct the formation of double-four-ring (d4r) unit is an effective way to prepare zeolite with extra-large pores, which however also brings about serious problems with regard to production cost and structure stability for their practical application. A new solvent-free thermal synthesis strategy is presented here for facile preparation and molecular-level mechanism study of extra-large-pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL-1 with -CLO structure. For the first time, the formation of intermediate d4r in the induction period was successfully confirmed, and was correlated with the synthesis condition of low water content and quaternary ammonium template with suitable alkyl chain length. The self-assembly pathway via d4r to form lta, afterwards clo and super cages was further revealed. This work shed light on the rational synthesis of Ge-free extra-large-pore zeotypes based on d4r route.",

        "Abstract": "Biomacromolecules are used to encapsulate carotenoids, but their poor absorption-enhancing ability restricts their application. This study integrated dietary fatty acids (FAs) into the protein-based encapsulation of fucoxanthin (FUCO) due to its positive role in carotenoid absorption. The results showed that of the 14 tested FAs, only myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and docosahexaenoic acid obviously promoted FUCO absorption. FAs were employed for FUCO encapsulation using bovine serum albumin (BSA) to fabricate FUCO-FA-BSA systems, with an encapsulation efficiency of > 98%, a particle size ranging from 113.1 nm to 193.5 nm, and a Zeta-potential between -32.8 mV and -38.3 mV. Electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed complete FUCO encapsulation, while the FUCO-loading particles exhibited a \"core-shell\" structure. The retention rate of the encapsulated FUCO increased 2.16-4.06 times when heated at 80.0 °C for 200 min. These results suggested that FA-BSA complexes might provide a promising strategy for embedding carotenoids.",

        "Abstract": "Differential gene expression analysis based on scRNA-seq data is challenging due to two unique characteristics of scRNA-seq data. First, multimodality and other heterogeneity of the gene expression among different cell conditions lead to divergences in the tail events or crossings of the expression distributions. Second, scRNA-seq data generally have a considerable fraction of dropout events, causing zero inflation in the expression. To account for the first characteristic, existing parametric approaches targeting the mean difference in gene expression are limited, while quantile regression that examines various locations in the distribution will improve the power. However, the second characteristic, zero inflation, makes the traditional quantile regression invalid and underpowered. We propose a quantile-based test that handles the two characteristics, multimodality and zero inflation, simultaneously. The proposed quantile rank-score based test for differential distribution detection (ZIQRank) is derived under a two-part quantile regression model for zero-inflated outcomes. It comprises a test in logistic modeling for the zero counts and a collection of rank-score tests adjusting for zero inflation at multiple prespecified quantiles of the positive part. The testing decision is based on an aggregate result by combining the marginal ",

        "Abstract": "Fucoxanthin, a special xanthophyll derived from marine algae, has increasingly attracted attention due to its diverse biological functions. However, reports on its ocular benefits are still limited. In this work, the ameliorative effect of fucoxanthin on visible light and lipid peroxidation-induced phagocytosis disruption in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells was investigated in vitro. Marked oxidative stress, inflammation, and phagocytosis disruption were evident in differentiated RPE cells following their exposure to visible light under a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich environment. Following pretreatment with fucoxanthin, however, the activated nuclear factor erythroid-derived-2-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway was observed and, furthermore, when the fucoxanthin -pretreated RPE cells were irradiated with visible light, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and inflammation were obviously suppressed, while phagocytosis was significantly improved. However, following the addition of Nrf2 inhibitor ML385, the fucoxanthin exhibited no ameliorative effects on the oxidative stress, inflammation, and phagocytosis disruption in the RPE cells, thus indicating that the ameliorative effect of fucoxanthin on the phagocytosis of RPE cells is closely related to the Nrf2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, these results suggest that fucoxanthin supplementation might be beneficial to the prevention of visible light-induced retinal injury.",

        "Abstract": "Cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is common in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), which is responsible for tumor staging and surgical strategy. The accurate preoperative identification of CLNM is essential. In this study, twenty consecutive patients with PTC received a parenchyma injection of Sonazoid followed by contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to identify CLNM. The specific lymphatic CEUS (LCEUS) signs for diagnosing CLNM were summarized, which were further compared with the resected specimens to get the pathological basis. After the injection of contrast agent, lymphatic vessel and lymph node (LN) could be exclusively displayed as hyperperfusion on LCEUS. The dynamic perfusion process of contrast agent in CLNM over time can be clearly visualized. Perfusion defect and interruption of bright ring were the two characteristic LCEUS signs in diagnosing CLNM. After comparing with pathology, perfusion defect was correlated to the metastatic foci in medulla and interruption of bright ring was correlated to the tumor seeding in marginal sinus (all p values < 0.001). The diagnostic efficacies of these two signs were high (perfusion defect vs. interruption of bright ring: AUC, 0.899, 95% CI 0.752-1.000 vs. 0.904, 0.803-1.000). LCEUS has advantages in identifying CLNM from PTC. The typical LCEUS signs of CLNM correlated with pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Neurological deficits after stroke are closely related to white matter microstructure damage. However, secondary changes in white matter microstructure after pontine infarction (PI) in the whole brain remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the correlation of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI)-derived diffusion and kurtosis parameters of abnormal white matter tracts with behavioral function in patients with chronic PI. Overall, 60 patients with unilateral chronic PI (33 patients with left PI and 27 patients with right PI) and 30 normal subjects were recruited and underwent DKI scans. Diffusion parameters derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and DKI and kurtosis parameters derived from DKI were obtained. Between-group differences in multiple parameters were analyzed to assess the changes in abnormal white matter microstructure. Moreover, we also calculated the sensitivities of different diffusion and kurtosis parameters of DTI and DKI for identifying abnormal white matter tracts. Correlations between the DKI-derived parameters in secondary microstructure changes and behavioral scores in the PI were analyzed. Compared with the NC group, both left PI and right PI groups showed more extensive perilesional and remote white matter microstructure changes. The DKI-derived diffusion parameters showed higher sensitivities than did the DTI-derived parameters. Further, DKI-derived diffusion and kurtosis parameters in abnormal white matter regions were correlated with impaired motor and cognitive function in patients with PI. In conclusion, PI could lead to extensive white matter tracts impairment in perilesional and remote regions. Further, the diffusion and kurtosis parameters could be complementary for identifying comprehensive tissue microstructural damage after PI.",

        "Abstract": "The inflammatory response of macrophages is an orderly and complex process under strict regulation accompanied by drastic changes in morphology and functions. It is predicted that proteins will undergo structural changes during these finely regulated processes. However, changes in structural proteome in macrophages during the inflammatory response remain poorly characterized. In the present study, we applied limited proteolysis coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) to identify proteome-wide structural changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. We identified 386 structure-specific proteolytic fingerprints from 230 proteins. Using the Gene Ontology (GO) biological process enrichment, we discovered that proteins with altered structures were enriched into protein folding-related terms, in which HSP60 was ranked as the most changed protein. We verified the structural changes in HSP60 by using cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and native CETSA. Our results showed that the thermal stability of HSP60 was enhanced in activated macrophages and formed an HSP10-less complex. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in situ structural systems biology is an effective method to characterize proteomic structural changes and reveal that the structures of chaperone proteins vary significantly during macrophage activation.",

        "Abstract": "Gridization is an alternative way to create macromolecules of various sizes in addition to linear and dendritic polymerization as well as cyclization. Organic nanogrids are an expanding family of macrocycle-like closed structures at the nanoscale, but with a series of well-defined extension edges and vertices. Cyclic nanogrids can be used as nanoscale building blocks for the fabrication of not only rotaxanes, catenanes, knots, 3D cages, but also nanopolymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and complex molecular cross-scale architectures. In this review, the history of fluorene-based macrocycles has first been explored, followed by the development of the synthetic methodologies; in particular, fluorene-based nanogrids are highlighted owing to their features and applications. Typically, fluorenes are fused arenes with a hybrid entity between tetrahedral Csp",

        "Title": "Environmental allergens house dust mite-induced asthma is associated with ferroptosis in the lungs.",
        "Abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that allergens such as house dust mites (HDM) in the environment can induce allergic asthma. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of regulatory cell death characterized by aberrant lipid peroxidation and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. However, whether ferroptosis participates in the pathological process of asthma remains to be elucidated. The present study used a HDM-induced mouse asthma model to determine the effect of HDM exposure on allergic asthma and its underlying mechanisms. Female BALB/c mice were intranasally exposed to HDM to induce allergic asthma. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), lung inflammation, mucus secretion, IgE levels, cytokine levels and inflammatory cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were investigated. In addition, the morphological changes of mitochondria, ROS levels, glutathione (GSH) levels and changes in ferroptosis pathway proteins were also determined in murine lungs. As a result, HDM exposure significantly increased AHR, inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus secretion around the airways. Furthermore, elevated IgE levels in the BALF, lung eosinophilia and a concomitant increase in IL-13 and IL-5 levels in BALF were observed. HDM inhalation increased ROS and decreased GSH levels in the lungs. HDM inhalation induced dysmorphic small mitochondria with decreased crista, as well as condensed, ruptured outer membranes. Western blotting demonstrated that the activities of glutathione peroxidase 4 and catalytic subunit solute carrier family 7 member 11 were significantly decreased, and that protein expression levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 and 15 lipoxygenase 1 were upregulated compared with mice in the normal control group. Overall, these results indicated that the AHR, airway inflammation, lipid peroxidation and ROS levels increased in HDM-induced asthma, and that HDM inhalation induced ferroptosis in the lungs, which helped to form an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic asthma.",

        "Abstract": "Gynecological laparoscopic surgery is the current routine treatment. Although the injury is relatively small, it is still a traumatic operation and also increases the recovery speed of patients. This paper mainly explores the intervention effect of rapid rehabilitation after gynecological laparoscopic surgery by means of WeChat group guidance based on the information adoption model and UTAUT model. Gynecological patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery and met the inclusion and exclusion conditions in a provincial maternal and child health hospital were selected as the research objects. The WeChat intervention group was compared with the nonintervention group, and the oral description score (VRS), comfort score (BCS), and 40-item recovery quality rating scale (QoR-40) were used as the scoring criteria. The results showed that the postoperative VRS and BCS scores in the WeChat intervention group were significantly lower than those in the nonintervention group. The total score of QoR-40 in both groups decreased compared with that before operation, reached the lowest on the first day after operation, and began to rise from the second day. This result is consistent with the patient's postoperative recovery process. After operation, the total score of the WeChat intervention group on days 1 and 2 was higher than that of the non-WeChat intervention group. By comparing the results of the patient's postoperative oral description score (VRS), comfort score (BCS), 40-item recovery quality score scale (QoR-40), etc., it can be shown that the overall recovery quality of the WeChat intervention group was better during these two days. In each section, the oral description score (VRS) and the 40-item recovery quality score scale (QoR-40) indicated that the pain sensation and emotional state scores of patients in the WeChat intervention group were higher than those in the nonintervention group, while the comfort score (BCS) was lower, indicating better comfort in the WeChat intervention group.",

        "Abstract": "Enabled by active motion of microrobots, conventional biological detection and chemical analyses limited by passive diffusion can be significantly enhanced with fast testing speed and unique sensitiveness. However, controlled release and precise enrichment of microrobot swarms are still difficult to accomplish and thus prohibit them away from practical applications. Here, an efficient and versatile strategy utilizing a needle-shaped hybrid sonoelectrode to disperse and aggregate distinct micromotors is presented, remarkably accelerating mass transfer and enhancing the signal intensity. Hydrogen bubbles generated at the tip of charged electrode can oscillate as actuated by the acoustic field, creating intensified vortexes to disperse micromotors spontaneously. Via removing the attached bubble, the sonoelectrode serving as solid needle isolator is capable of collecting micromotors in a large scale with acoustic streaming in the working reservoir at higher ultrasound frequency. Numerical calculation reveals the streaming profiles with/without microbubbles, and manipulations on classic spherical and tubular micromotor models confirm that the acoustic-powered prototype device is effective for controlling different swarming behaviors in microfluidic channels. Overall, the proposed hybrid sonoelectrode offers a universal and rapid strategy to tailor micromotor swarm behaviors, advancing intelligent microrobots to be featured with active enrichment and compatible for next-generation sensitive portable detection microsystems.",

        "Title": "Development of a Chinese College Students' Attitudes Toward Sexual Swear Words Scale.",
        "Abstract": "Sexual swear words are frequently used and considered vulgar and controversial in Chinese. The study of attitude is not only an important part of the study of swear words, but is also an important way for predicting their use. To date, few independent studies have been conducted on Chinese sexual swear words; those that have been conducted mostly focus on language ontology rather than language use. The studies have mainly used qualitative research methods, with a lack of empirical analysis and use of measurement tools. It is feasible and necessary to study college students as the object of sexual swear words because of the prevalence of \"Zu'an culture\" and the abuse of sexual swear words. Based on the current research status of Chinese swear words and the context of using swear words on campus, this paper combines the research of linguistic differences in swearing, psychological theories, and social science measurement theories and uses SPSS and Mplus statistical software to develop Chinese college students' attitudes toward Sexual Swear Words Scale. The participants consist of students from Zhejiang Normal University and other universities. A total of 262 college students participated in the preliminary test. Through item analysis and exploratory factor analysis, the formal scale was formed. A total of 608 college students were formally tested, and confirmatory factor analysis, reliability, and validity tests were carried out to produce the final scale. The scale contains three subscales: Cognition (17 items), Affection (17 items), and Behavior Tendency (15 items). The results show that each subscale model fits well, has good reliability and validity, and can be used as an important tool to measure attitudes of Chinese college students toward sexual swear words.",

Zaoheibao grape berries, and the effects of VvANR silencing on berries phenotype; gene expression level of ANS, LAR1, LAR2, and UFGT; enzyme activity of ANS; and accumulations of anthocyanin and flavan-3-ol were investigated. At the third day after treatment, the VvANR silenced grape berries began to turn red slightly, which was 2 days earlier than that of the control group. And the flavan-3-ol content in VvANR-silenced grape berries had been remarkable within 1 to 5 days, the ANR enzyme activity in VvANR-silenced grapes extremely significantly decreased in 3 days, and LAR enzyme activity also decreased, but the difference was not striking. The ANS enzyme activity of the transformed berries was significantly higher than that of the control after 3 days of infection, and it was exceedingly significantly higher than that of the control after 5 to 10 days. The content of anthocyanin in transformed berries increased of a very marked difference within 3 to 15 days. pTRV2-ANR infection resulted in an extremely significant decrease in the expression of VvANR gene, and the expression of VvLAR1, VvLAR2, VvMYBPA1, VvMYBPA2, and VvDFR were also down-regulated. However, the expression of VvANS and VvUFGT was up-regulated significantly. After VvANR silencing via VIGS, VvANR expression in grape berries was extremely significantly decreased, resulting in decreased ANR enzyme activity and flavan-3-ol content; berries turned red and deeper in advance. In addition, VvANR silencing can induce up-regulation of VvANS and VvUFGT expression, significantly increase ANS enzyme activity, and increase of anthocyanin accumulation.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer risk models increasingly are including mammographic density (MD) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) to improve identification of higher-risk women who may benefit from genetic screening, earlier and supplemental breast screening, chemoprevention, and other targeted interventions. Here, we present additional considerations for improved clinical use of risk prediction models with MD, PRS, and questionnaire-based risk factors. These considerations include whether changing risk factor patterns, including MD, can improve risk prediction and management, and whether PRS could help inform breast cancer screening without MD measures and prior to the age at initiation of population-based mammography. We further argue that it may be time to reconsider issues around breast cancer risk models that may warrant a more comprehensive head-to-head comparison with other methods for risk factor assessment and risk prediction, including emerging artificial intelligence methods. With the increasing recognition of limitations of any single mathematical model, no matter how simplified, we are at an important juncture for consideration of these different approaches for improved risk stratification in geographically and ethnically diverse populations.",

        "Abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammation of the soft tissue surrounding and supporting the teeth, which causes periodontal structural damage, alveolar bone resorption, and even tooth loss. Its prevalence is very high, with nearly 60% of the global population affected. Hence, periodontitis is an important public health concern, and the development of effective healing treatments for oral diseases is a major target of the health sciences. Currently, the application of local drug delivery systems (LDDS) as an adjunctive therapy to scaling and root planning (SRP) in periodontitis is a promising strategy, giving higher efficacy and fewer side effects by controlling drug release. The cornerstone of successful periodontitis therapy is to select an appropriate bioactive agent and route of administration. In this context, this review highlights applications of LDDS with different properties in the treatment of periodontitis with or without systemic diseases, in order to reveal existing challenges and future research directions.",

        "Abstract": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) causes substantial economic losses to the global pig industry. Members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family are the important effectors of the innate immune response against viral infections. We have previously characterized the entire porcine TRIM (pTRIM) family, and predicted pTRIM5, 14, 21, 25 and 38 as host restriction factors against PRRSV infection. However, little is known about whether and how pTRIMs restrict the infection of PRRSV. In this study, we firstly performed the amino acid alignments of the RING domain of pTRIM5, 21, 25 and 38, and found that pTRIM proteins contained the characteristic consensus C3HC4 type zinc-binding motif which is important for the ubiquitination function. Then we detected the mRNA changes of pTRIMs in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) by transcriptome sequencing after PRRSV infection in piglets. Transcriptional profiles showed that the expression of pTRIM5, 21 and 26 was significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated, consistent with their expression in vitro. Finally, as the most up-regulated gene after PRRSV infection both in vivo and in vitro, pTRIM21 was investigated for its anti-PRRSV activity in immortalized PAMs (iPAMs) in two aspects: knockdown and overexpression of pTRIM21. Knockdown of endogenic pTRIM21 could significantly promote PRRSV replication at 12 and 24 h post infection in iPAMs. Meanwhile, overexpression of pTRIM21 could significantly suppress PRRSV replication but not affect its attachment and endocytosis. Moreover, pTRIM21 RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase was essential for anti-PRRSV activity. Our data enhance our understanding of the pTRIMs against PRRSV infection, which may help us develop novel therapeutic tools to control PRRSV.",

        "Title": "USP22 promotes melanoma and BRAF inhibitor resistance via YAP stabilization.",
        "Abstract": "Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a conserved transcriptional coactivator that plays key roles in controlling organ size, tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Emerging evidence shows that YAP is overexpressed and associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitor treatment in melanoma. However, the mechanism accounting for YAP-overexpression in melanoma is largely unknown. The present study characterized ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) as a deubiquitinase controlling YAP abundance and biological functions in melanoma. Using western blotting and immunohistochemical staining, it was found that the expression of USP22 and YAP was associated in melanoma cell lines and patient samples. Moreover, USP22 interacted with and deubiquitinated YAP to prevent YAP turnover. Depletion of USP22 decreased YAP expression, which in turn suppressed cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, overexpression of USP22 conferred vemurafenib resistance in a YAP-dependent manner. Overall, the present study revealed the important role of the USP22/YAP axis in melanoma and BRAF inhibitor resistance, and provides a rationale to target USP22/YAP for melanoma treatment.",

        "Title": "Mechanism of rutaecarpine on ethanol-induced acute gastric ulcer using integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology.",
        "Abstract": "This study was aimed to explore the mechanism of rutaecarpine (RUT) on ethanol-induced gastric ulcer (GU) in mice by integrated approaches. At first, the efficacy was determined through the macroscopic and microscopic state of stomach tissue and the expression levels of GU-related factors. Then, the serum metabolomics method based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was used to explore the specific metabolites and metabolic pathways. Finally, the upstream key protein targets of these specific metabolites were analyzed by network pharmacology and verified by PCR to explore the potential mechanism. RUT alleviated the histological and pathological damage of gastric tissue caused by ethanol, and could remarkably ameliorate the level of GU-related factors. Subsequently, a total of 7 potential metabolites involved in 9 metabolic pathways were identified by metabolomics analysis. Then, a 'component-targets-metabolites' interaction network was constructed, and therefore 4 key target proteins (PLA2G1B, PDE5A, MIF and SRC) that may regulate the specific metabolites were obtained. This case was further verified by the results of PCR. ALL the above results strongly demonstrated that RUT exerted a gastroprotective effect against GU. And it is the first time to combine metabolomics combined with network pharmacology to elucidate the mechanism of RUT on GU, which may be related to the regulation of energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation, and these pathways may be regulated through the upstream protein PLA2G1B, PDE5A, MIF and SRC.",

        "Abstract": "This study evaluates the protective role of oyster peptide (OP) on the occurrence of Exercise-Hypogonadal Male Condition. Male rats were given heavy-load swimming training and / or OP was supplemented for 6 consecutive weeks. After heavy-load training, sperm count, sperm viability and sperm motility in epididymis, testosterone in serum and testis, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) and androgen receptor (AR) in testis and mating times were remarkably decreased, malondialdehyde (MDA), capture latency and mating latency were significantly increased, mRNA expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) and P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) were obviously down-regulated, but serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) were not statistically changed. Conversely, when OP was supplemented at heavy-load training, sperm count, sperm viability and sperm motility in epididymis, serum FSH, LH, testosterone, GSH-px, superoxide dismutase (SOD), testosterone, AR in testis and mating times were dramatically increased, while testicular MDA, capture latency and mating latency were significantly decreased, and mRNA expression of StAR, StARD7, P450scc and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) were significantly up-regulated. In conclusion, heavy-load training causes testicular spermatogenic and steroidogenic disorders by enhancing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be protected by the co-administration of OP by enhancing the function of pituitary gonad axis and lowering ROS generation.",

Here, we extend these findings to advanced pulmonary fibrosis using cultured precision-cut lung slices from explants of patients with IPF undergoing transplantation. During these experiments, we were surprised to discover that not only did EGCG attenuate TGFβ1 signalling and new collagen accumulation but also activated matrix metalloproteinase-dependent collagen I turnover, raising the possibility of slow fibrosis resolution with continued treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease and acupuncture is frequently used in patients suffering from asthma in clinic. However, the regulatory mechanism of acupuncture treatment in asthma is not fully elucidated. We sought to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture on asthma and the associated regulatory mechanism. An ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse asthma model was established and the effect of acupuncture on airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), mucus hypersecretion and inflammation was assessed. Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis of lung tissue and bioinformatics analysis were performed. Our results revealed that the OVA-induced mouse asthma model was successfully established with the significantly elevated AHR to methacholine (Mch), and acupuncture was effective in attenuation of AHR to Mch, peribronchial and perivascular inflammation and mucus production. The inflammatory cells around the airways, mucous secretion as well as levels of IgE, CCL5, CCL11, IL-17A in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 levels in serum were siginificantly inhibited by acupuncture. TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis found that a total of 6078 quantifiable proteins were identiﬁed, and 564 (334 up-regulated and 230 down regulated) differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identiﬁed in OVA-induced asthma model group (A) versus normal control group (NC). Acupuncture treatment resulted in 667 DEPs (416 up-regulated and 251 down regulated) compared with A group, and 86 overlapping DEPs were identiﬁed in NC, A and AA groups. Among the 86 overlapping DEPs, we identified 41 DEPs regulated by acupuncture. Based on the above data, we performed a systematic bioinformatics analysis of the 41 DEPs, and results showed that these 41 DEPs were predominantly related to 4 KEGG pathways including SNARE interactions in vesicular transport, ferroptosis, endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, and protein digestion and absorption. DEPs of SLC3A2 and ATP1A3 expression levels were verified by immumohistochemical staining. Mice in OVA-induced asthma model group had elevated SLC3A2 and ATP1A3 expression and acupuncture had the ability to downregulate SLC3A2 and ATP1A3 protein expression. Furthermore, acupuncture reduced the MDA level and increased the GSH and SOD levels in the lung tissue. Taken together, our data suggested that acupuncture was effective in treating asthma by attenuation of AHR, mucus secretion and airway inflammation, and the mechanism was associated with regulation of ferroptosis, SLC3A2 and ATP1A3 protein expression as well as oxidative stress. Results from our experiments revealed the anti-inflammatory effect of acupuncture in OVA-induced mouse asthma model, leading to a more effective approach to be chosen by patients in clinic.",

        "Abstract": "Abnormal cerebral blood flow (CBF) and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) are sensitive biomarkers of disease progression and prognosis. This study investigated neural underpinnings of motor and cognitive recovery by longitudinally studying the changes of CBF and FC in pontine infarction (PI). Twenty patients underwent three-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (3D-pcASL), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans, and behavioral assessments at 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months after stroke. Twenty normal control (NC) subjects underwent the same examination once. First, we investigated CBF changes in the acute stage, and longitudinal changes from 1 week to 6 months after PI. Brain regions with longitudinal CBF changes were then used as seeds to investigate longitudinal FC alterations during the follow-up period. Compared with NC, patients in the left PI (LPI) and right PI (RPI) groups showed significant CBF alterations in the bilateral cerebellum and some supratentorial brain regions at the baseline stage. Longitudinal analysis revealed that altered CBF values in the right supramarginal (SMG_R) for the LPI group, while the RPI group showed significantly dynamic changes of CBF in the left calcarine sulcus (CAL_L), middle occipital gyrus (MOG_L), and right supplementary motor area (SMA_R). Using the SMG_R as the seed in the LPI group, FC changes were found in the MOG_L, middle temporal gyrus (MTG_L), and prefrontal lobe (IFG_L). Correlation analysis showed that longitudinal CBF changes in the SMG_R and FC values between the SMG_R and MOG_L were associated with motor and memory scores in the LPI group, and longitudinal CBF changes in the CAL_L and SMA_R were related to memory and motor recovery in the RPI group. These longitudinal CBF and accompany FC alterations may provide insights into the neural mechanism underlying functional recovery after PI, including that of motor and cognitive functions.",

        "Abstract": "The treatment of recurrent cervical cancer, especially pelvic locoregional recurrence, is very challenging for gynecologic oncologists. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with Endostar, a novel modified recombinant human endostatin, in patients with pelvic locoregional recurrence of cervical cancer following surgical treatment.This phase 2 study was conducted between May 2018 and May 2019 at a single center in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and enrolled 31 patients with pelvic locoregional recurrence of cervical cancer following surgical treatment. All patients were treated with IMRT-based CCRT for 6 weeks and intravenous infusions of Endostar (15 mg/m), which were administered on days 1 to 7 of CCRT, followed by rest for 4 weeks. After resting, chemotherapy with cisplatin (70 mg/m) plus paclitaxel (135-175 mg/m) was given every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments.Thirty-one patients were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The mean age was 50.03 years (SD 7.72). The objective response rate was 67.74% and the disease control rate was 83.87% (48.39% achieved a complete response, 19.35% a partial response, 16.13% had disease stabilization, and 16.13% had progressive disease). The most common adverse events were nausea, vomiting, alopecia, neutropenia, and leukopenia; most events were grade 1 or 2 in intensity. Grade 3 toxicities included thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in 2 patients each, and leukopenia in 4 patients. No cases of grade 4 acute toxicity were observed.IMRT-based CCRT with Endostar infusions is effective and safe. Our results support the use of this treatment for patients with pelvic locoregional recurrence of cervical cancer following surgical treatment.",
