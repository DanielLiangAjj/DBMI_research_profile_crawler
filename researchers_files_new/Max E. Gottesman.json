        "Abstract": "In bacteria, transcription is coupled to, and can be regulated by, translation. Although recent structural studies suggest that the N-utilization substance G (NusG) transcription factor can serve as a direct, physical link between the transcribing RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the lead ribosome, mechanistic studies investigating the potential role of NusG in mediating transcription-translation coupling are lacking. Here, we report development of a cellular extract- and reporter gene-based, in vitro biochemical system that supports transcription-translation coupling as well as the use of this system to study the role of NusG in coupling. Our findings show that NusG is required for coupling and that the enhanced gene expression that results from coupling is dependent on the ability of NusG to directly interact with the lead ribosome. Moreover, we provide strong evidence that NusG-mediated coupling enhances gene expression through a mechanism in which the lead ribosome that is tethered to the RNAP by NusG suppresses spontaneous backtracking of the RNAP on its DNA template that would otherwise inhibit transcription.",

        "Title": "DksA and DNA double-strand break repair.",
        "Abstract": "We use genetic assays to suggest that transcription-coupled repair or new origin formation in Escherichia coli involves removal of RNAP to create an RNA primer for DNA synthesis. Transcription factor DksA was shown to play a role in numerous reactions involving RNA polymerase. Some, but not all, of the activities of DksA at promoters or during transcription elongation require (p)ppGpp. In addition to its role during transcription, DksA is also involved in maintaining genome integrity. Cells lacking DksA are sensitive to multiple DNA damaging agents including UV light, ionizing radiation, mitomycin C, and nalidixic acid. Here, we focus on two recent studies addressing the importance of DksA in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs), one by Sivaramakrishnan et al. (Nature 550:214-218, 2017) and one originating in our laboratory, Myka et al. (Mol Microbiol 111:1382-1397. https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14227 , 2019). It appears that depending on the type and possibly location of DNA damage, DksA can play either a passive or an active role in DSB repair. The passive role relies on exclusion of anti-backtracking factors from the RNAP secondary channel. The exact mechanism of active DksA-mediated DNA repair is unknown. However, DksA was proposed to destabilize transcription complexes, thus clearing the way for recombination and DNA repair. Based on the requirement for DksA, both in repair of DSBs and the R-loop-dependent formation of new origins of DNA replication, we propose that DksA may allow for removal of RNAP without unwinding of the RNA:DNA hybrid, which can then be extended by a DNA polymerase. This mechanism obviates the need for RNAP backtracking to repair damaged DNA.",

        "Abstract": "The formation of new replication origins (cSDR) and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in E.Â coli share a commonality. We find that the two processes require the RNAP-associated factor, DksA. However, whereas cSDR also relies on (p)ppGpp, the alarmone molecule is dispensable for the repair of topoisomerase type II (Top II) DNA adducts and associated DSBs. The requirement for DksA in repair of nalidixic acid (Nal)-induced DSBs or for the formation of new origins is not suppressed by a greA deletion mutation, indicating an active role of DksA rather than competition with GreA for insertion into the RNAP secondary channel. Like dksA mutations, transcription termination factor Rho mutations also confer sensitivity to Nal. The rho and dksA mutations are not epistatic, suggesting they involve different repair pathways. The roles of DksA in DSB repair and cSDR differ; certain DksA and RNAP mutants are able to support the first process, but not the latter. We suggest that new origin formation and DNA repair of protein adducts with DSBs may both involve the removal of RNAP without destruction of the RNA:DNA hybrid.",

NMR revealed association of the NusG carboxy-terminal domain with S10 (NusE), implying a direct role for NusG as a bridge linking RNAP and the lead ribosome. Here we present the first in vitro and in vivo evidence of full-length NusG association with mature 70S ribosomes. Binding did not require accessory factors in vitro. Mutating the NusG:S10 binding interface at NusG F165 or NusE M88 and D97 residues weakened NusG:S10 association in vivo and completely abolished it in vitro, supporting the specificity of this interaction. Mutations in the binding interface increased sensitivity to chloramphenicol. This phenotype was suppressed by rpoB*35, an RNAP mutation that reduces replisome-RNAP clashes. We propose that weakened NusG:S10 interaction leads to uncoupling when translation is inhibited, with resulting RNAP backtracking, replication blocks and formation of lethal DNA double-strand breaks.",

        "Abstract": "The coliphage HK022 protein Nun transcription elongation arrest factor inhibits RNA polymerase translocation. In vivo, Nun acts specifically to block transcription of the coliphage Î» chromosome. Using in vitro assays, we demonstrate that Nun cross-links RNA in an RNA:DNA hybrid within a ternary elongation complex (TEC). Both the 5' and the 3' ends of the RNA cross-link Nun, implying that Nun contacts RNA polymerase both at the upstream edge of the RNA:DNA hybrid and in the vicinity of the catalytic center. This finding suggests that Nun may inhibit translocation by more than one mechanism. Transcription elongation factor GreA efficiently blocked Nun cross-linking to the 3' end of the transcript, whereas the highly homologous GreB factor did not. Surprisingly, both factors strongly suppressed Nun cross-linking to the 5' end of the RNA, suggesting that GreA and GreB can enter the RNA exit channel as well as the secondary channel, where they are known to bind. These findings extend the known action mechanism for these ubiquitous cellular factors.",

ICLs are repaired during and outside S phase, and replication-independent ICL repair (RIR) is critical to maintain genomic integrity and to allow transcription in nondividing or slowly dividing cells. Here, we show that the Y family DNA polymerase kappa (Pol Îº) is essential for RIR of a site-specific ICL lesion in Xenopus egg extracts, and that both its catalytic activity and UBZ domains are required for this function. We also demonstrate a requirement for PCNA and its modification on lysine 164. Finally, we show that Pol Îº participates in ICL repair in mammalian cells, particularly in G0. Our results identify key components of the RIR pathway and begin to unravel its mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "Loss of retinoid-containing lipid droplets upon hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is one of the first events in the development of liver disease leading to hepatocellular carcinoma. Although retinoid stores are progressively lost from HSCs during the development of hepatic disease, how this affects hepatocarcinogenesis is unclear. To investigate this, we used diethylnitrosamine (DEN) to induce hepatic tumorigenesis in matched wild-type (WT) and lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) knockout (KO) mice, which lack stored retinoid and HSC lipid droplets. Male 15-day-old WT or Lrat KO mice were given intraperitoneal injections of DEN (25 mg/kg body wt). Eight months later, Lrat KO mice showed significantly less liver tumor development compared with WT mice, characterized by less liver tumor incidence and smaller tumor size. Two days after DEN injection, lower serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and decreased hepatic levels of cyclin D1 were observed in Lrat KO mice. Lrat KO mice also exhibited increased levels of retinoic acid-responsive genes, including p21, lower levels of cytochrome P450 enzymes required for DEN bioactivation and higher levels of the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), both before and after DEN treatment. Our results indicate that Lrat KO mice are less susceptible to DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis due to increased retinoid signaling and higher expression of p21, which is accompanied by altered hepatic levels of DEN-activating enzymes and MGMT in Lrat KO mice also contribute to decreased cancer initiation and suppressed liver tumor development.",

        "Abstract": "DNA replication fork movement is impeded by collisions with transcription elongation complexes (TEC). We propose that a critical function of transcription termination factors is to prevent TEC from blocking DNA replication and inducing replication fork arrest, one consequence of which is DNA double-strand breaks. We show that inhibition of Rho-dependent transcription termination by bicyclomycin in Escherichia coli induced double-strand breaks. Cells deleted for Rho-cofactors nusA and nusG were hypersensitive to bicyclomycin, and had extensive chromosome fragmentation even in the absence of the drug. An RNA polymerase mutation that destabilizes TEC (rpoB*35) increased bicyclomycin resistance >40-fold. Double-strand break formation depended on DNA replication, and can be explained by replication fork collapse. Deleting recombination genes required for replication fork repair (recB and ruvC) increased sensitivity to bicyclomycin, as did loss of the replication fork reloading helicases rep and priA. We propose that Rho responds to a translocating replisome by releasing obstructing TEC.",

Protein expression level is the dominant determinant of the clock rate in a number of organisms.

        "Abstract": "Phage lambda propagation in Escherichia coli host cells requires transcription antitermination on the lambda chromosome mediated by lambdaN protein and four host Nus factors, NusA, B, E (ribosomal S10) and G. Interaction of E. coli NusB:NusE heterodimer with the single stranded BoxA motif of lambdanutL or lambdanutR RNA is crucial for this reaction. Similarly, binding of NusB:NusE to a BoxA motif is essential to suppress transcription termination in the ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons. We used fluorescence anisotropy to measure the binding properties of NusB and of NusB:NusE heterodimer to BoxA-containing RNAs differing in length and sequence. Our results demonstrate that BoxA is necessary and sufficient for binding. We also studied the gain-of-function D118N NusB mutant that allows lambda growth in nusA1 or nusE71 mutants. In vivo lambda burst-size determinations, CD thermal unfolding measurements and X-ray crystallography of this as well as various other NusB D118 mutants showed the importance of size and polarity of amino acid 118 for RNA binding and other interactions. Our work suggests that the affinity of the NusB:NusE complex to BoxA RNA is precisely tuned to maximize control of transcription termination.",

        "Abstract": "The Nun protein of coliphage HK022 excludes superinfecting lambda phage. Nun recognizes and binds to the N utilization (nut) sites on phage lambda nascent RNA and induces transcription termination. Overexpression of Nun from a high-copy plasmid is toxic for Escherichia coli, despite the fact that nut sites are not encoded in the E. coli genome. Cells expressing Nun cannot exit stationary phase. Toxicity is related to transcription termination, since host and nun mutations that block termination also suppress cell killing. Nun inhibits expression of wild-type lacZ, but not lacZ expressed from the Crp/cAMP-independent lacUV5 promoter. Microarray and proteomic analyses show that Nun down-regulates crp and tnaA. Crp overexpression and high indole concentrations partially reverse Nun-mediated toxicity and restore lacZ expression.",

        "Title": "Role of an RNase III binding site in transcription termination at lambda nutL by HK022 Nun protein.",
        "Abstract": "The phage HK022 Nun protein excludes phage lambda by binding nascent lambda pL and pR transcripts at nutL and nutR, respectively, and inducing transcription termination just downstream of these sites. Termination is more efficient at nutL than at nutR. One difference between nutL and nutR is the presence of RNase III processing sites (rIII) located immediately promoter distal to lambda nutL. We found that deletion of rIII dramatically reduced Nun transcription arrest in vitro but had little effect on termination in vivo. However, consistent with the in vitro results, overexpression of a transcript carrying nutL and rIII efficiently titrated Nun, allowing lambda to grow on a strain that expressed Nun, whereas a transcript carrying only nutL or nutL-rIII with nucleotides 97 to 141 deleted was ineffective. Rnc70, an RNase III mutant that binds but does not cleave rIII, also prevented Nun-mediated lambda exclusion. We propose that rIII enhances the on-rate of Nun at nutL, stimulating Nun-mediated arrest in vitro. We have shown that a specific element in rIII, i.e., box C (G89GUGUGUG), strongly enhances arrest on rIII+ templates. Nun-rIII interactions do not stimulate Nun termination in vivo, presumably because formation of the Nun-nutL complex is normally not rate-limiting in the cell. In contrast to Nun, N is not occluded by Rnc70 and is not efficiently titrated by a nutL-rIII transcript.",

        "Abstract": "The 109 amino acid residue Nun protein expressed from prophage HK022 excludes superinfecting phage lambda by arresting transcription on the lambda chromosome near the lambdanut sites. In vitro, the Nun N terminus binds to nascent lambdanutRNA, whereas the C terminus interacts with RNA polymerase and DNA template. Escherichia coli host factors, NusA, NusB, NusE (S10), and NusG, stimulate Nun-arrest. NusA binds the Nun C terminus and enhances formation of the Nun-nutRNA complex. Because of these in vitro activities of NusA, and since a nusA mutation (nusAE136K) blocked Nun in vivo, we assumed that NusA was required for Nun activity. However, using a nusAts strain, we find that NusA is required for termination at nutR but not at nutL. Furthermore, nusAE136K is dominant to nusA(+) for Nun-arrest, both in vitro and in vivo. NusAE136K shows increased affinity for Nun and, unlike NusA(+), can readily be recovered in a ternary complex with Nun and nutRNA. We propose NusAE136K suppresses Nun-arrest when it is a component of the transcription elongation complex, perhaps, in part, by blocking interactions between the Nun C terminus and RNA polymerase and DNA. We also find that in contrast to Nun-arrest, antitermination by lambda N requires NusA.",

        "Abstract": "Circulating retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives) are found predominantly as retinol bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP), which transports retinol from liver stores to target tissues, or as retinyl ester incorporated in lipoproteins of dietary origin. The transport of retinoids from maternal to fetal circulation is poorly understood, especially under conditions of inadequate dietary vitamin A intake. Here we present RBP-/- mice as a tunable model of embryonic vitamin A deficiency. This model has enabled us to analyze metabolic links between maternal nutrition and retinoid delivery to the fetus. Our data show that retinol-RBP is the primary contributor to fetal development, whereas retinyl ester are largely responsible for accumulation of fetal retinoid stores. Furthermore, these studies indicate the importance of embryonic RBP in distributing vitamin A to certain developing tissues under restrictive diets. We also show differences among developing tissues in their dependency on the embryonic retinol-RBP pathway. Finally, we demonstrate that accumulation of embryonic vitamin A stores does not depend on the expression of RBP in the fetal liver.",

In higher eukaryotes, cAMP signaling originating at the plasma membrane is distributed to different subcellular districts by cAMP waves received by PKA bound to PKA anchor proteins (AKAPs) tethered to these compartments. This review focuses on the subgroup of AKAPs that anchor PKA to the mitochondrial outer membrane (mtAKAPs). Only PKA anchored to mtAKAPs can efficiently transmit cAMP signals to mitochondria. mtAKAP complexes are remarkably heterogeneous. In addition to PKA regulatory subunits, they may include mRNAs, tyrosine phosphatase(s) and tyrosine kinase(s). Selective regulation of these components by cAMP-PKA integrates various signal transduction pathways and can determine which subcellular compartment receives the signal. Unveiling the interactions among the components of these large complexes will shed light on how cAMP and PKA regulate vital mitochondrial processes.",

        "Abstract": "The 109-amino acid Nun protein of prophage HK022 excludes superinfecting bacteriophage lambda by blocking transcription elongation on the lambda chromosome. Multiple interactions between Nun and the transcription elongation complex are involved in this reaction. The Nun NH(2)-terminal arginine-rich motif binds BOXB sequence in nascent lambda transcripts, whereas the COOH terminus binds RNA polymerase and contacts DNA template. Nun Trp(108) is required for interaction with DNA and transcription arrest. We analyzed the role of the adjacent Lys(106) and Lys(107) residues in the Nun reaction. Substitution of the lysine residues with arginine (K106R/K107R) had no effect on transcription arrest in vitro or in vivo. Nun K106A/K107A was partially active, whereas Nun K106D/K107D was defective in vitro and failed to exclude lambda. All mutants bound RNA polymerase and BOXB. In contrast to Nun K106R/K107R and K106A/K107A, Nun K106D/K107D did not cross-link DNA template. These results suggest that transcription arrest is facilitated by electrostatic interactions between positively charged Nun residues Lys(106) and Lys(107) and negatively charged DNA phosphate groups. These may assist intercalation of Trp(108) into template.",

        "Abstract": "Retinoids are required for normal embryonic development. Both embryonic retinoid deficiency and excess result in congenital malformations. There is little understanding of the physiology underlying retinoid transfer from the maternal circulation to the embryo. We now report studies that explore this process using retinol-binding protein-deficient (RBP-/-) mice and mice that express human RBP on the RBP-/-) background. Our studies establish that dietary retinoid, bound to lipoproteins, can serve as an important source for meeting tissue retinoid requirements during embryogenesis. Indeed, retinyl ester concentrations in the circulations of pregnant RBP-/- mice are significantly elevated over those observed in wild-type mice, suggesting that lipoprotein retinyl esters may compensate for the absence of retinol-RBP during pregnancy. We also demonstrate, contrary to earlier proposals, that maternal RBP does not cross the placenta and cannot enter the fetal circulation. Overall, our data indicate that both retinol-RBP and retinyl esters bound to lipoproteins are able to provide sufficient retinoid to the embryo to allow for normal embryonic development.",

Heteronuclear NMR studies have been performed on a Nun peptide comprising residues 1-49 bound to the nutR BoxB RNA. The pattern of (13)C chemical shifts indicates that the arginine-rich motif of Nun forms an induced alpha-helix, consisting of residues 23-43, when bound to BoxB RNA, consistent with the structure of a shorter (residues 22-44) Nun peptide/BoxB RNA complex [Faber, C., SchÃ¤rpf, M., Becker, T., Sticht, H. and RÃ¶sch (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 32064-32070]. The N-terminal extension, residues 1-22, does not show chemical shifts or nuclear Overhauser effects characteristic of stable secondary structure. Nonetheless, (15)N relaxation measurements indicate that this region is not completely disordered, as expected for a random coil peptide. Restriction of conformation flexibility in the N-terminal extension of Nun may be important for binding to other target molecules involved in transcription termination.",

In contrast, in a purified in vitro system, Nun arrests transcription on lambdaDNA templates without dissociation of the transcription elongation complex (TEC). Our evidence indicates that transcription-repair coupling factor (Mfd) frees Nun-arrested RNA polymerase. The activity of Nun is enhanced in an mfd-null mutant, consistent with prolonged association of Nun with the TEC. Furthermore, expression of lambda nut RNA in the mfd mutant titrates Nun, allowing superinfecting lambda to form plaques. Finally, addition of Mfd releases a Nun-arrested transcription complex in vitro.",

        "Abstract": "The N-terminal arginine-rich motif of phage HK022 Nun protein binds to NUT sequences in phage lambda nascent transcripts and induces transcription termination. Interactions between the Nun C terminus and RNA polymerase as well as the DNA template are required for termination. We have isolated Nun C-terminal point and deletion mutants that are unable to block transcription. The mutants bind NUT RNA and inhibit translation of the lambda N gene. Thus HK022 excludes lambda both by terminating transcription on the phage chromosome and by preventing translation of the essential lambda N gene. Like N autoregulation, translation repression by Nun requires host RNaseIII deficiency (rnc) or a mutation in the RNaseIII processing site (rIII) located between NUTL and the beginning of the N coding sequence. Our data support the idea that Nun bound at NUTL causes steric interference with ribosome attachment to the nearby N coding sequence. Two models, Nun acting alone or in complex with host proteins, are discussed.",

AKAP121, which tethers PKAII to the outer mitochondrial membrane, includes a K homology (KH) RNA-binding motif. Purified AKAP121 KH domain binds the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of transcripts encoding the Fo-f subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Binding requires a structural motif in the 3'UTR and is stimulated by PKA phosphorylation of the domain or a mutation that mimics this phosphorylation. AKAP121 expressed in HeLa cells promotes the translocation of MnSOD mRNA from cytosol to mitochondria and an increase in mitochondrial MnSOD. Both reactions are stimulated by cAMP. Thus, by focusing translation at the mitochondrial membrane, AKAP121 may facilitate import of mitochondrial proteins in response to cAMP stimulation.",

A transgenic mouse strain that expresses human RBP under the control of the muscle creatine kinase promoter in the null background was generated. The exogenous protein bound retinol and transthyretin in the circulation and effectively delivered retinol to the eye. Thus, RBP expressed from an ectopic source suppresses the visual phenotype, and retinoids accumulate in the eye. No human RBP was found in the retinal pigment epithelium of the transgenic mice, indicating that retinol uptake by the eye does not entail endocytosis of the carrier RBP.",
