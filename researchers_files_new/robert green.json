        "Abstract": "Panel germline testing allows for the efficient detection of deleterious variants for multiple conditions, but the benefits and harms of identifying these variants are not always well understood. We present a multi-gene, multi-disease aggregate utility formula that allows the user to consider adding or removing each gene in a panel based on variant frequency, estimated penetrances, and subjective disutilities for testing positive but not developing the disease and testing negative but developing the disease. We provide credible intervals for utility that reflect uncertainty in penetrance estimates. Rare, highly penetrant deleterious variants tend to contribute positive net utilities for a wide variety of user-specified disutilities, even when accounting for parameter estimation uncertainty. However, the clinical utility of deleterious variants with moderate, uncertain penetrance depends more on assumed disutilities. The decision to include a gene on a panel depends on variant frequency, penetrance, and subjective utilities and should account for uncertainties around these factors.",

        "Abstract": "HLA matching improves long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation, yet implementation challenges persist, particularly within the African American (Black) patient demographic due to donor scarcity. Consequently, kidney survival rates among Black patients significantly lag behind those of other racial groups. A refined matching scheme holds promise for improving kidney survival, with prioritized matching for Black patients potentially bolstering rates of HLA-matched transplants. To facilitate quantity, quality and equity in kidney transplants, we propose two matching algorithms based on quantification of HLA immunogenicity using the hydrophobic mismatch score (HMS) for prospective transplants. We mined the national transplant patient database (SRTR) for a diverse group of donors and recipients with known racial backgrounds. Additionally, we use novel methods to infer survival assessment in the simulated transplants generated by our matching algorithms, in the absence of actual target outcomes, utilizing modified unsupervised clustering techniques. Our allocation algorithms demonstrated the ability to match 87.7% of Black and 86.1% of White recipients under the HLA immunogenicity threshold of 10. Notably, at the lowest HMS threshold of 0, 4.4% of Black and 12.1% of White recipients were matched, a marked increase from the 1.8% and 6.6% matched under the prevailing allocation scheme. Furthermore, our allocation algorithms yielded similar or improved survival rates, as illustrated by Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, and enhanced survival prediction accuracy, evidenced by C-indices and Integrated Brier Scores.",

        "Abstract": "Bleeding and thrombosis are common extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) complications associated with increased mortality. Heparin is the most commonly used ECMO anticoagulant, employed in 94% of cases. Reduced antithrombin III (AT3) levels could decrease heparin effectiveness. Neonates have inherently lower levels of AT3 than adults, and pediatric patients on ECMO can develop AT3 deficiency. One potential approach for patients on ECMO with AT3 deficiency is exogenous AT3 supplementation. However, there is conflicting data concerning the use of AT3 for pediatric and neonatal patients on ECMO.",

        "Abstract": "Newborn genomic sequencing (NBSeq) to screen for medically important genetic information is of considerable interest but data characterizing the actionability of such findings, and the downstream medical efforts in response to discovery of unanticipated genetic risk variants, are lacking. From a clinical trial of comprehensive exome sequencing in 127 apparently healthy infants and 32 infants in intensive care, we previously identified 17 infants (10.7%) with unanticipated monogenic disease risks (uMDRs). In this analysis, we assessed actionability for each of these uMDRs with a modified ClinGen actionability semiquantitative metric (CASQM) and created radar plots representing degrees of penetrance of the condition, severity of the condition, effectiveness of intervention, and tolerability of intervention. In addition, we followed each of these infants for 3-5 years after disclosure and tracked the medical actions prompted by these findings. All 17 uMDR findings were scored as moderately or highly actionable on the CASQM (mean 9, range: 7-11 on a 0-12 scale) and several distinctive visual patterns emerged on the radar plots. In three infants, uMDRs revealed unsuspected genetic etiologies for existing phenotypes, and in the remaining 14 infants, uMDRs provided risk stratification for future medical surveillance. In 13 infants, uMDRs prompted screening for at-risk family members, three of whom underwent cancer-risk-reducing surgeries. Although assessments of clinical utility and cost-effectiveness will require larger datasets, these findings suggest that large-scale comprehensive sequencing of newborns will reveal numerous actionable uMDRs and precipitate substantial, and in some cases lifesaving, downstream medical care in newborns and their family members.",

        "Abstract": "Saccade planning and execution can be affected by a multitude of factors present in a target selection task. Recent studies have shown that the similarity between a target and nearby distractors affects the curvature of saccade trajectories, because of target-distractor competition. To further understand the nature of this competition, we varied the distance between and the similarity of complex target and distractor objects in a delayed match-to-sample task to examine their effects on human saccade trajectories and better understand the underlying neural circuitry. For trials with short saccadic reaction times (SRTs) when target-distractor competition is still active, the distractor is attractive and saccade trajectories are deviated toward the distractor. We found a robust effect of distance consistent with saccade vector averaging, whereas the effect of similarity suggested the existence of an object-based suppressive surround. At longer SRTs, there was sufficient time for competition between the objects to complete and the distractor to be repulsive, which resulted in saccade trajectory deviations away from the distractor exhibiting the effects of a spatial suppressive surround. In terms of similarity, as the target-distractor similarity decreased, the initial saccade angle shifted toward the target, reflecting stronger distractor inhibition. There were no interactions between distance and similarity at any point in the time course of target-distractor competition. Together, saccade trajectories reflect target-distractor competition that is affected independently by both spatial and object space suppressive surrounds. The differences in saccade trajectories at short and long SRTs distinguish between active and completed decision-making processes.",

The CFL phosphors are often coated twice by depositing a light coat of rare-earth-containing phosphors over the inexpensive halophosphate phosphor, which generates white light with high efficacy and a good color rendering index and possesses a balance between phosphor cost and performance. Costs of phosphors can be mitigated by requiring lower rare-earth ion concentrations or by completely eliminating rare-earth ions, which was one of the main goals of investigating the oxyfluorides Sr",

In the research domain, large-scale analyses, including whole genome sequencing with variant interpretation and curation, virtually guarantee identification of variants that are pathogenic or likely pathogenic and actionable. Multiple guidelines recommend that findings associated with actionable conditions be offered to research participants in order to demonstrate respect for autonomy, reciprocity, and participant interests in health and privacy. Some recommendations go further and support offering a wider range of findings, including those that are not immediately actionable. In addition, entities covered by the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may be required to provide a participant's raw genomic data on request. Despite these widely endorsed guidelines and requirements, the implementation of return of genomic results and data by researchers remains uneven. This article analyzes the ethical and legal foundations for researcher duties to offer adult participants their interpreted results and raw data as the new normal in genomic research.",

        "Abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) can prevent progression of several genetic disorders. Although a subset of these disorders are identified on newborn screening panels, others are not identified until irreversible symptoms develop. Genetic testing is an efficient methodology to ascertain pre-symptomatic children, but the penetrance of risk-associated variants in the general population is not well understood. We developed a list of 127 genes associated with disorders treatable with HSCT. We identified likely pathogenic or pathogenic (LP/P) and loss-of-function (LoF) variants in these genes in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), a dataset containing exome and genome sequencing data from 141,456 healthy adults. Within gnomAD, we identified 59 individuals with a LP/P or LoF variant in 15 genes. Genes were associated with bone marrow failure syndromes, bleeding disorders, primary immunodeficiencies, osteopetrosis, metabolic disorders, and epidermolysis bullosa. In conclusion, few ostensibly healthy adults had genotypes associated with pediatric disorders treatable with HSCTs. Given that most of these disorders do not have biomarkers that could be cheaply and universally assessed on a standard newborn screen, our data suggest that genetic testing may be a complementary approach to traditional newborn screening methodology that has the potential to improve mortality and is not expected to lead to a high burden of false-positive results.",

Best practices are evolving but are likely to involve integrating a PRS into an absolute risk model and using guideline-driven care linked to a specific threshold of risk. Because this approach is not currently available for most diseases, it may be necessary to use different methods of presenting risk and linking it to appropriate clinical action. We discuss the trade-offs of each strategy and argue for transparent communication to providers and patients of the imprecision in both risk estimates and action thresholds for PRSs.",

        "Abstract": "Over 100 million research participants around the world have had research array-based genotyping (GT) or genome sequencing (GS), but only a small fraction of these have been offered return of actionable genomic findings (gRoR). Between 2017 and 2021, we analyzed genomic results from 36,417 participants in the Mass General Brigham Biobank and offered to confirm and return pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants (PLPVs) in 59 genes. Variant verification prior to participant recontact revealed that GT falsely identified PLPVs in 44.9% of samples, and GT failed to identify 72.0% of PLPVs detected in a subset of samples that were also sequenced. GT and GS detected verified PLPVs in 1% and 2.5% of the cohort, respectively. Of 256 participants who were alerted that they carried actionable PLPVs, 37.5% actively or passively declined further disclosure. 76.3% of those carrying PLPVs were unaware that they were carrying the variant, and over half of those met published professional criteria for genetic testing but had never been tested. This gRoR protocol cost approximately $129,000 USD per year in laboratory testing and research staff support, representing $14 per participant whose DNA was analyzed or $3,224 per participant in whom a PLPV was confirmed and disclosed. These data provide logistical details around gRoR that could help other investigators planning to return genomic results.",

The PBHS is an ongoing, multicenter, longitudinal cohort study with data from four initial enrollment sites. PBHS participants are recruited from the general population along with groups enriched for heart disease and cancer disease risk. Cross-sectional data on return of results were collected in 2017-2018 from an (1) in-person enrollment survey (n = 1,890), (2) benchmark online survey (n = 1,059), and (3) participant interviews (n = 21). The main outcomes included (1) preferences for type of information to be added next to returned results, (2) participant plans for sharing returned results with a non-study clinician, and (3) choice to opt-out of receiving genetic results. Results were compared by sociodemographic characteristics. Enrollment and benchmark survey respondents were 57.1% and 53.5% female, and 60.0% and 66.2% white, respectively. Participants preferred the following data types be added to returned results in the future: genetics (29.9%), heart imaging, (16.4%), study watch (15.8%), and microbiome (13.3%). Older adults (OR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.41-0.87) were less likely to want their genetic results returned next. Forty percent of participants reported that they would not share all returned results with their non-study clinicians. Black (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.95) and Asian (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.73) participants were less likely, and older participants more likely (OR 1.45-1.61), to plan to share all results with their clinician than their counterparts. At enrollment, 5.8% of participants opted out of receiving their genetics results. The study showed that substantial heterogeneity existed in participant's preferences and expectations for return of results, and variations were related to sociodemographic characteristics.",

        "Abstract": "Radial frequency (RF) patterns, circles which have had their radius modulated as a function of their polar angle, have been used in the examination of the integration of contour information around closed contour patterns. Typically, these patterns have been presented in a random orientation from trial-to-trial in order to maintain spatial uncertainty as to the location of the deformation on the pattern, as it may affect observer strategy and performance. However, the effect of fixed and random orientation (phase) on observer gaze strategies used to discriminate RF patterns has not been directly tested. This study compared fixation patterns across four conditions: fixed phase single cycle; random phase single cycle; fixed phase three cycle; and random phase three cycle RF3 patterns. The results showed that observers fixated on the known location of deformation for the fixed phase single cycle condition but used a more central fixation for the other three conditions. This strategy had a significant effect on observer thresholds for the fixed phase single cycle condition, with greater adherence to the strategy resulting in lower thresholds. It was also found that for the single cycle patterns observers tended to fixate on different locations on the pattern: on the maximum orientation difference from circular for the fixed phase pattern; and on the point of maximum curvature for the random phase pattern. These differences in gaze patterns are likely driven by the underlying local or global processing of the fixed or random phase single cycle patterns, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur in burn patients with or without inhalational injury and can significantly increase mortality. For patients with severe respiratory failure who fail conventional therapy with mechanical ventilation, the use of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be a life-saving salvage therapy. There have been a series of case reports detailing the use of ECMO in burn patients over the last 20 years, but very little is currently known about the status of ECMO use at burn centers in North America. Using a web-based survey of burn center directors in Canada and the United States, we examined the rate of usage of ECMO in burn care, barriers to its use, and the perioperative management of burn patients receiving ECMO therapy. Our findings indicate that approximately half of the burn centers have used ECMO in the care of burn patients, but patient volume is very low on average (less than 1 per year). Of centers that do use ECMO in burn care, only 40% have a specified protocol for doing so. Approximately half have operated on patients being actively treated with ECMO therapy, but perioperative management of anticoagulation varies widely. A lack of experience and institutional support and a perceived lack of evidence to support ECMO use in burn patients were the most commonly identified barriers to more widespread uptake. Better collaboration between burn centers will allow for the creation of consensus statements and protocols to improve outcomes for burn patients who require ECMO.",

        "Title": "Sudden Collapse of Magnetic Order in Oxygen-Deficient Nickelate Films.",
        "Abstract": "Antiferromagnetic order is a common and robust ground state in the parent (undoped) phase of several strongly correlated electron systems. The progressive weakening of antiferromagnetic correlations upon doping paves the way for a variety of emergent many-electron phenomena including unconventional superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, and collective charge-spin-orbital ordering. In this study, we explored the use of oxygen stoichiometry as an alternative pathway to modify the coupled magnetic and electronic ground state in the family of rare earth nickelates (RENiO_{3-x}). Using a combination of x-ray spectroscopy and resonant soft x-ray magnetic scattering, we find that, while oxygen vacancies rapidly alter the electronic configuration within the Ni and O orbital manifolds, antiferromagnetic order is remarkably robust to substantial levels of carrier doping, only to suddenly collapse beyond 0.21 e^{-}/Ni without an accompanying structural transition. Our work demonstrates that ordered magnetism in RENiO_{3-x} is mostly insensitive to carrier doping up to significant levels unseen in other transition-metal oxides. The sudden collapse of ordered magnetism upon oxygen removal may provide a new mechanism for solid-state magnetoionic switching and new applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics.",

        "Abstract": "The VeriFiler™ Plus PCR Amplification Kit is a 6-dye multiplex assay that simultaneously amplifies a set of 23 autosomal markers (D3S1358, vWA, D16S539, CSF1PO, D6S1043, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D2S441, D19S433, FGA, D10S1248, D22S1045, D1S1656, D13S317, D7S820, Penta E, Penta D, TH01, D12S391, D2S1338, and TPOX), a quality indicator system, and two sex-identification markers. Combined, the markers satisfy the requirements of the Chinese National autosomal DNA database as well as expanded CODIS (Combined DNA Index System). The VeriFiler Plus kit was developed with an improved Master Mix which incorporates the brighter TED™ dye, and accommodates a higher sample loading volume thus allowing for increased sensitivity and enabling maximum information recovery from challenging casework samples including touch, degraded, and inhibited samples. Here, we report the results of the developmental validation study which followed the SWGDAM (Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods) guidelines and includes data for PCR-based studies, sensitivity, species specificity, stability, precision, reproducibility and repeatability, concordance, stutter, DNA mixtures, and performance on mock casework samples. The results validate the multiplex design as well as demonstrate the kit's robustness, reliability, and suitability as an assay for human identification with casework DNA samples.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of individuals, particularly at international border crossings, coupled with the evolving sophistication of identity documents are issues that authorities must contend with. Particularly, the ability to distinguish legitimate from counterfeit documents, with high throughput, sensitivity, and selectivity is an ever-evolving challenge. Over the last decade, an increasing number of security features have been introduced by authorities in identification documents. The latest generation of travel documents (such as passports and national ID cards) forego paper substrates for several layers of polycarbonate, allowing security features to be embedded within the documents. These security features may contain information at either the superficial and sub-surface levels, thus increasing the document's resilience to counterfeiting. As the documents become harder to forge, so does the sophistication of forgery detection. There appears to be an unmet and evolving need to identify such sophisticated forgeries, in a non-destructive, high throughput manner. In this publication, we report on the application of optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging on assessing security features in specimen passports and national ID cards. OCT allows sub-surface imaging of translucent structures, non-destructively enabling quantitative visualisation of embedded security features.",

        "Title": "A medication therapy management residency rotation adjusts to coronavirus disease 2019 constraints.",
        "Abstract": "The purpose of this commentary is to describe the Johns Hopkins Home Care Group's (JHHCG) Community-based Pharmacy Residency Medication Therapy Management (MTM) rotation, summarize adjustments made to the rotation after the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, describe key learnings from the adjustments, and provide a call to action for other residency programs seeking to improve their rotations amidst pandemic restrictions. MTM clinical pharmacists at JHHCG collaborate with patients to identify barriers to adherence, review medications, and develop plans for improvement. Through improved medication adherence, the goals for this program are to reduce adverse effects, patient cost, and medical visits or hospital admissions. Central to this practice is the belief that strong patient relationships are necessary to uncover the root cause of medication nonadherence. In Postgraduate Year-1 (PGY-1) community-based pharmacy residency training, new pharmacists learn the value of building relationships with patients and working through complex problems during this clinical experience. By assisting patients with complex medical conditions and social situations, new pharmacists gain skills in patient care, pharmacy operations, and medication access challenges. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced the discontinuation of face-to-face interactions in this setting, rotation experiences for residents were adapted with the goal of continuing high-impact patient interactions and keeping everyone involved safe. Although considerable changes were made to the MTM rotation because of the COVID-19 pandemic, residents were still able to provide meaningful clinical care telephonically and continued to learn valuable patient care skills. Most importantly, high quality care was still delivered to the patients despite considerable challenges. The major challenge for the residents' clinical experiences as a result of the adjustments has been finding an impactful volume of complex patients to enhance their skills. Other residency programs are encouraged to consider three recommendations to improve their rotations moving forward.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) will look very different to the more familiar monogenic testing. Here we argue that despite these differences, most of the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) raised in the monogenic setting, such as the relevance of results to family members, the approach to secondary and incidental findings, and the role of expert mediators, continue to be relevant in the polygenic context, albeit in modified form. In addition, PRS will reanimate other old debates. Their use has been proposed both in the practice of clinical medicine and of public health, two contexts with differing norms. In each of these domains, it is unclear what endpoints clinical use of PRS should aim to maximize and under what constraints. Reducing health disparities is a key value for public health, but clinical use of PRS could exacerbate race-based health disparities owing to differences in predictive power across ancestry groups. Finally, PRS will force a reckoning with pre-existing questions concerning biomarkers, namely the relevance of self-reported race, ethnicity and ancestry, and the relationship of risk factors to disease diagnoses. In this Opinion, we argue that despite the parallels to the monogenic setting, new work is urgently needed to gather data, consider normative implications, and develop best practices around this emerging branch of genomics.",

        "Abstract": "Plants measure light quality, intensity, and duration to coordinate growth and development with daily and seasonal changes in environmental conditions; however, the molecular details linking photochemistry to signal transduction remain incomplete. Two closely related light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domain-containing photoreceptor proteins, ZEITLUPE (ZTL) and FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1), divergently regulate the protein stability of circadian clock and photoperiodic flowering components to mediate daily and seasonal development. Using structural approaches, we identified that mutations at the Gly46 position led to global rearrangements of the ZTL dimer interface in the isolated ZTL-LOV domain. Specifically, G46S and G46A variants induce a 180° rotation about the ZTL-LOV dimer interface that is coupled to ordering of N- and C-terminal signaling elements. These conformational changes hinge upon rotation of a C-terminal Gln residue (Gln154) analogous to that present in light-state structures of ZTL. In contrast to other LOV proteins, a Q154L variant retains light-state interactions with GIGANTEA (GI), thereby indicating N5 protonation is not required for ZTL signaling. The results presented herein confirm a divergent signaling mechanism within ZTL, whereby steric and electronic effects following adduct formation can be sufficient for signal propagation in LOV proteins containing a Gly residue at position 46. Examination of bacterial LOV structures with Gly residues at the equivalent position suggests that mechanisms of signal transduction in LOV proteins may be fluid across the LOV protein family.",

        "Abstract": "Despite advances in burn care, mortality in adult patients with extensive burn injuries remains a concern, particularly in those who develop concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In cases of ARDS refractory to conventional treatments, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may represent a viable salvage therapy, even in the major burn population. We present the case of a 38-year-old man with full thickness burns to over 80% of his body, who developed severe ARDS 4 days postburn. After failing to respond to deep sedation, paralysis, and proning, ECMO therapy was initiated to maintain oxygenation and ventilation. Over the next 14 days, while the patient was treated with ECMO, he successfully underwent three major operations to debride and allograft approximately 65% of his body surface area, including one in the prone position. ECMO therapy was discontinued on postburn day 18, and the patient had his wounds reconstructed and survived his injuries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a burn patient with such severe burns requiring surgical intervention that has been treated with ECMO and survived, and the first case of a burn patient on ECMO having surgery in the prone position. They conclude this case serves as a \"proof of concept\" that ECMO is a potential treatment for appropriately selected major burn patients with ARDS who fail to respond to other therapies.",

        "Abstract": "The symbiotic relationship between legumes and rhizobium bacteria in root nodules has a high demand for iron, and questions remain regarding which transporters are involved. Here, we characterize two nodule-specific Vacuolar iron Transporter-Like (VTL) proteins in Medicago truncatula. Localization of fluorescent fusion proteins and mutant studies were carried out to correlate with existing RNA-seq data showing differential expression of VTL4 and VTL8 during early and late infection, respectively. The vtl4 insertion lines showed decreased nitrogen fixation capacity associated with more immature nodules and less elongated bacteroids. A mutant line lacking the tandemly-arranged VTL4-VTL8 genes, named 13U, was unable to develop functional nodules and failed to fix nitrogen, which was almost fully restored by expression of VTL8 alone. Using a newly developed lux reporter to monitor iron status of the bacteroids, a moderate decrease in luminescence signal was observed in vtl4 mutant nodules and a strong decrease in 13U nodules. Iron transport capability of VTL4 and VTL8 was shown by yeast complementation. These data indicate that VTL8, the closest homologue of SEN1 in Lotus japonicus, is the main route for delivering iron to symbiotic rhizobia. We propose that a failure in iron protein maturation leads to early senescence of the bacteroids.",

        "Abstract": "Prolonged immobility has detrimental consequences for critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Previous work has shown that early mobilization of ICU patients is a safe, feasible and effective strategy to improve outcomes; however, few of these studies focused on trauma ICU patients. Our objective was to assess the impact of implementing an ICU early mobilization protocol (EMP) on trauma outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Perception of local properties of the visual field is influenced by aftereffects of adaptation. The tilt aftereffect describes repulsion of the perceived orientation of a line from the orientation of an adapting line. Analogous effects of spatial context are often called illusions. Repulsion of the perceived orientation of a grating from the orientation of a surrounding grating is referred to as the tilt illusion. In the same manner, the size aftereffect and Ebbinghaus illusion form a complementary pair of temporal and spatial context effects of size. Here we report psychophysical evidence for a previously unknown aspect-ratio illusion which causes the perceived aspect-ratio of a rectangle to be repelled from the aspect-ratio of rectangles surrounding it. This illusion provides a spatial analogue to the aspect-ratio aftereffect.",

        "Abstract": "While genetic testing may be the gateway to the future of medicine, it also poses challenges for individuals, especially in terms of differentiated treatments on the basis of their genetic characteristics. The fear of unwanted disclosure to insurers and the possibility of genetic discrimination can hamper the recruitment of individuals for clinical research that involves genetic testing. Precision medicine initiatives, such as All of Us, are proliferating in the United States. In order to succeed, however, they must ensure that the millions of Americans recruited to share their genetic data are not penalized with regard to life, disability and long-term insurance coverage. In this Perspective, we discuss several initiatives adopted by countries around the world, such as the United Kingdom and France, that better balance the interests of insurers and research subjects, and explain how the United States might learn from them. We call for regulatory and industry leadership to come together to establish a voluntary moratorium on insurance pricing with the aim of protecting research participants.",

        "Title": "Phase specific shape aftereffects explained by the tilt aftereffect.",
        "Abstract": "Aftereffects of adaptation are frequently used to infer mechanisms of human visual perception. Commonly, the properties of stimuli are repelled from properties of the adaptor. For example, in the tilt aftereffect a line is repelled in orientation from a previously experienced line. Perceived orientation is predicted by the centroid of the responses of a population of mechanisms individually tuned to limited ranges of orientation but collectively sensitive to the whole possible range. Aftereffects are also predictable if the mechanisms are allowed to adapt. Adaptation across radial frequency patterns, patterns deformed from circular by a sinusoidal modulation of radius, causes repulsive aftereffects, sensitive to the relative amplitudes and orientations of the patterns. Here we show that these shape aftereffects can be accounted for by the application of local tilt aftereffects around the shape contour. We suggest that fields of tilt aftereffects might provide a general mechanism for exaggerating the perceptual difference between successively experienced stimuli, making them more discriminable. If the human visual system does indeed exploit this possibility, then the conclusions often made by studies assuming adaptation within mechanisms sensitive to the shape of stimuli will need to be reconsidered.

        "Abstract": "Opportunistic genomic screening is becoming increasingly common as laboratories adopt recommendations to report secondary genomic findings. In parallel, interest in using genome sequencing as a population screening test has grown rapidly. We consider here 3 potential applications of genome sequencing for preventive medicine: (1) provider-ordered predispositional testing in healthy adults, (2) indication-based testing with opportunistic screening of secondary results, and (3) population screening in the public health context. We conclude that despite superficial similarities, there are important and fundamental differences in the way medical risks and benefits can be addressed in these 3 contexts. Recommendations to report secondary genomic findings should not be interpreted as an endorsement of population genomic screening. Ongoing work is developing the evidence that will be needed to fully justify current and future initiatives in population genomic screening.

        "Abstract": "Cytochrome P450s have been shown to play a vital role in the xenobiotic detoxification system of Sclerotinia homoeocarpa, the causal agent of the turfgrass disease dollar spot. A previous study indicated that three CYP450s were validated to play a functional role in resistance against different fungicide classes including propiconazole and plant growth regulator, flurprimidol. In this study, we present these CYP450s possess the capability to modify the multi-site mode of action fungicide chlorothalonil. Chlorothalonil is an extensively used contact fungicide and has been shown to persist in soils. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) indicated faster rates of chlorothalonil biotransformation by CYP561 and CYP65 overexpression strains when compared to the wild-type and CYP68 overexpression strain. Our GC-MS results show that the primary transformation intermediate found in soils, 4-hydroxy-2,5,6 trichloro-isophthalonitrile is produced by CYP450s' metabolism. These findings suggest fungal CYP450s can biotransform chlorothalonil for biodegradation or detoxification.",

        "Abstract": "There is an ongoing debate over whether there is convincing evidence in support of global contour integration in shape discrimination tasks, particularly when using radial frequency (RF) patterns as stimuli (Baldwin, Schmidtmann, Kingdom, & Hess, 2016). The objection lies in the previous use of high-threshold theory (HTT), rather than signal detection theory (SDT) to model the probability summation estimates of observer thresholds to determine whether integration of information is occurring around the contour. Here we used a discrimination at threshold method to establish evidence of global processing of two frequently used RF patterns (RF3 and RF5) that does not require mathematical modeling. To provide a bridge between current and past research we examined the two proposed methods, finding that HTT produced probability summation estimates that were more conservative than SDT (when an appropriate number of channels was used to generate estimates). We found no difference in observer thresholds when an RF pattern was presented as the only test stimulus in a block of trials or when two RF patterns were interleaved, and no evidence for a decrease in psychometric slopes with increasing numbers of stimulus elements. These findings are contrary to what is predicted by SDT for a stimulus whose detection conforms to probability summation. Therefore, our results find no evidence that supports probability summation, further demonstrating the importance of using random phase RF patterns while measuring integration around a contour and providing strong evidence for global shape processing around low frequency RF patterns.",

        "Title": "Integration of shape information occurs around closed contours but not across them.",
        "Abstract": "Scenery and complex objects can be reduced to a combination of shapes, so it is pertinent to examine if the integration of information found occurring around simple contours also occurs across them. Baldwin, Schmidtmann, Kingdom, and Hess (2016) investigated this idea using radial frequency (RF) patterns, distributing information around a single contour or across four contours. However, their use of a restricted number of locations for this information may have influenced their results (see Green, Dickinson, & Badcock, 2017). The current study revisits their paradigm using random-phase (spatial uncertainty) presentation of RF patterns with 11 observers. Results provide strong evidence for the integration of information around single contours but not across them. These findings are contrary to the lack of integration found by Baldwin et al. (2016) within a single contour, but do provide support for their suggestion that improvement in performance when adding information to separate RF patterns is a function of probability summation. Similar to Green et al. (2017), it suggests the importance of using random-phase RF patterns when measuring integration.",

        "Title": "The effect of spatiotemporal displacement on the integration of shape information.",
        "Abstract": "Within a natural scene it is not uncommon for an object's shape to be revealed over time. We investigated whether the same integration of shape information that happens around a fully visible contour also happens when that information is distributed over time. In a two-interval forced-choice task, observers discriminated between a radial frequency (RF) pattern and a circle that were revealed either using an implicit slit or traced out by a dot's motion; and a line and a modulated line that were either contour-defined or motion-defined. First, with presentation times of approximately 1 s, we found no difference in the strength of integration when comparing a freely visible contour to one that (a) moved behind a slit; (b) was revealed by a moving slit; or (c) revealed piecemeal by a slit appearing at random locations (Experiment 1). Changing the duration of presentation (250-4,000 ms) had no effect on strength of integration or threshold for detection within the moving slit condition (Experiment 2). Considering these results, Experiment 3 revisited integration for a dot tracing out an RF path (Or, Thabet, Wilkinson, & Wilson, 2011), finding removal of a change in speed cue increased the strength of integration to that found in Experiments 1 and 2 of the current study. The pattern of results for modulated lines was different from RF patterns; however, within these conditions, there was no difference in strength of integration between contour-defined and motion-defined stimuli. Our results suggest motion-defined patterns are processed as form from motion.",

Fifty-two parents with children 2 to 12 years old in a resident continuity clinic in East Harlem, New York, completed a survey asking about children's and parent's practice and quantitative consumption of juice and SSBs as well as parental knowledge of the AAP recommendations on juice limits. Parent's total daily consumption of juice and SSBs ( P < .01), parent's score on the test of AAP guidelines ( P = .04), and parent's post-high school education ( P = .01) were associated with children's juice and SSB consumption in a multivariable linear regression model. Children's consumption of juice and SSBs is positively associated with parental consumption of juice and SSBs and negatively associated with parental formal education and knowledge of the AAP recommendations on juice limits.",

        "Abstract": "Electrosynthesis has much to offer to the synthetic organic chemist. But in order to be widely accepted as a routine procedure in an organic synthesis laboratory, electrosynthesis needs to be presented in a much more user-friendly way. The literature is largely based on electrolysis in a glass beaker or H-cells that often give poor performance for synthesis with a very slow rate of conversion and, often, low selectivity and reproducibility. Flow cells can lead to much improved performance. Electrolysis is participating in the trend toward continuous flow synthesis, and this has led to a number of innovations in flow cell design that make possible selective syntheses with high conversion of reactant to product with a single passage of the reactant solution through the cell. In addition, the needs of the synthetic organic chemist can often be met by flow cells operating with recycle of the reactant solution. These cells give a high rate of product formation while the reactant concentration is high, but they perform best at low conversion. Both approaches are considered in this review and the important features of each cell design are discussed. Throughout, the application of the cell designs is illustrated with syntheses that have been reported.",

        "Title": "Global processing of random-phase radial frequency patterns but not modulated lines.",
        "Abstract": "Previously, researchers have used circular contours with sinusoidal deformations of the radius (radial frequency [RF] patterns) to investigate the underlying processing involved in simple shape perception. On finding that the rapid improvement in sensitivity to deformation as more cycles of modulation were added was greater than expected from probability summation across sets of local independent detectors, they concluded that global integration of contour information was occurring. More recently, this conclusion has been questioned by researchers using a method of calculating probability summation derived from signal detection theory (Baldwin, Schmidtmann, Kingdom, & Hess, 2016). They could not distinguish between global integration and probability summation. Furthermore, it has been argued that RF patterns and lines are processed in a similar manner (Mullen, Beaudot, & Ivanov, 2011; Schmidtmann & Kingdom, 2017). The current study investigates these claims using fixed-phase (in which the local elements have spatial certainty) and random-phase (in which the local elements have spatial uncertainty) RF patterns and modulated lines. Thresholds were collected from eight naïve observers and compared to probability summation estimates calculated using methods derived from both high threshold theory and signal detection theory. The results indicate global processing of random-phase RF patterns and evidence for an interaction between local and global cues for fixed-phase RF patterns. They also show no evidence of global integration with modulated line stimuli. The results provide further evidence for the global processing of random-phase RF patterns and indicate that RF patterns and modulated lines are processed differently.",

        "Title": "Relative seismic velocity variations correlate with deformation at Kīlauea volcano.",
        "Abstract": "Seismic noise interferometry allows the continuous and real-time measurement of relative seismic velocity through a volcanic edifice. Because seismic velocity is sensitive to the pressurization state of the system, this method is an exciting new monitoring tool at active volcanoes. Despite the potential of this tool, no studies have yet comprehensively compared velocity to other geophysical observables on a short-term time scale at a volcano over a significant length of time. We use volcanic tremor (~0.3 to 1.0 Hz) at Kīlauea as a passive source for interferometry to measure relative velocity changes with time. By cross-correlating the vertical component of day-long seismic records between ~230 station pairs, we extract coherent and temporally consistent coda wave signals with time lags of up to 120 s. Our resulting time series of relative velocity shows a remarkable correlation between relative velocity and the radial tilt record measured at Kīlauea summit, consistently correlating on a time scale of days to weeks for almost the entire study period (June 2011 to November 2015). As the summit continually deforms in deflation-inflation events, the velocity decreases and increases, respectively. Modeling of strain at Kīlauea suggests that, during inflation of the shallow magma reservoir (1 to 2 km below the surface), most of the edifice is dominated by compression-hence closing cracks and producing faster velocities-and vice versa. The excellent correlation between relative velocity and deformation in this study provides an opportunity to understand better the mechanisms causing seismic velocity changes at volcanoes, and therefore realize the potential of passive interferometry as a monitoring tool.",

        "Abstract": "PurposeTelephone disclosure of genetic test results can improve access to services. To date, studies of its impact have focused on return of Mendelian risk information, principally hereditary cancer syndromes.MethodsIn a multisite trial of Alzheimer disease genetic risk disclosure, asymptomatic adults were randomized to receive test results in person or via telephone. Primary analyses examined patient outcomes 12 months after disclosure.ResultsData from 257 participants showed that telephone disclosure occurred 7.4 days sooner and was 30% shorter, on average, than in-person disclosure (both P < 0.001). Anxiety and depression scores were well below cutoffs for clinical concern across protocols. Comparing telephone and in-person disclosure protocols, 99% confidence intervals of mean differences were within noninferiority margins on scales assessing anxiety, depression, and test-related distress, but inconclusive about positive impact. No differences were observed on measures of recall and subjective impact. Subanalyses supported noninferiority on all outcomes among apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4-negative participants. Subanalyses were inconclusive for APOE ɛ4-positive participants, although mean anxiety and depression scores were still well below cutoffs for clinical concern.ConclusionTelephone disclosure of APOE results and risk for Alzheimer disease is generally safe and helps providers meet demands for services, even when results identify an increased risk for disease.",

The solar-reflected regime spans the 0.38 - 2.5 μm interval, and is captured by a wide range of current and planned instruments on both airborne and orbital platforms. To date there has been no systematic study of its spectral dimensionality as a function of space, time, and land cover. Here we report a multi-site, multi-year statistical survey by NASA's \"Classic\" Airborne Visible Near InfraRed Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C). AVIRIS-C measured large regions of California, USA, spanning wide latitudinal and elevation gradients containing all canonical MODIS land cover types. The spectral uniformity of the AVIRIS-C design enabled consistent in-scene assessment of measurement noise across acquisitions. The estimated dimensionality as a function of cover type ranged from the low 20s to the high 40s, and was approximately 50 for the combined dataset. This result indicates the high diversity of physical processes distinguishable by imaging spectrometers like AVIRIS-C for one region of the Earth.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose Significant concerns exist regarding the potential for unwarranted behavior changes and the overuse of health care resources in response to direct-to-consumer personal genomic testing (PGT). However, little is known about customers' behaviors after PGT. Methods Longitudinal surveys were given to new customers of 23andMe (Mountain View, CA) and Pathway Genomics (San Diego, CA). Survey data were linked to individual-level PGT results through a secure data transfer process. Results Of the 1,042 customers who completed baseline and 6-month surveys (response rate, 71.2%), 762 had complete cancer-related data and were analyzed. Most customers reported that learning about their genetic risk of cancers was a motivation for testing (colorectal, 88%; prostate, 95%; breast, 94%). No customers tested positive for pathogenic mutations in highly penetrant cancer susceptibility genes. A minority of individuals received elevated single nucleotide polymorphism-based PGT cancer risk estimates (colorectal, 24%; prostate, 24%; breast, 12%). At 6 months, customers who received elevated PGT cancer risk estimates were not significantly more likely to change their diet, exercise, or advanced planning behaviors or engage in cancer screening, compared with individuals at average or reduced risk. Men who received elevated PGT prostate cancer risk estimates changed their vitamin and supplement use more than those at average or reduced risk (22% v 7.6%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.44 to 8.18). Predictors of 6-month behavior include baseline behavior (exercise, vitamin or supplement use, and screening), worse health status (diet and vitamin or supplement use), and older age (advanced planning, screening). Conclusion Most adults receiving elevated direct-to-consumer PGT single nucleotide polymorphism-based cancer risk estimates did not significantly change their diet, exercise, advanced care planning, or cancer screening behaviors.",

        "Abstract": "In populations that have not been selected for family history of disease, it is unclear how commonly pathogenic variants (PVs) in disease-associated genes for rare Mendelian conditions are found and how often they are associated with clinical features of these conditions. We conducted independent, prospective analyses of participants in two community-based epidemiological studies to test the hypothesis that persons carrying PVs in any of 56 genes that lead to 24 dominantly inherited, actionable conditions are more likely to exhibit the clinical features of the corresponding diseases than those without PVs. Among 462 European American Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and 3223 African-American Jackson Heart Study (JHS) participants who were exome-sequenced, we identified and classified 642 and 4429 unique variants, respectively, in these 56 genes while blinded to clinical data. In the same participants, we ascertained related clinical features from the participants' clinical history of cancer and most recent echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and lipid measurements, without knowledge of variant classification. PVs were found in 5 FHS (1.1%) and 31 JHS (1.0%) participants. Carriers of PVs were more likely than expected, on the basis of incidence in noncarriers, to have related clinical features in both FHS (80.0% versus 12.4%) and JHS (26.9% versus 5.4%), yielding standardized incidence ratios of 6.4 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7 to 16.5; P = 7 × 10",

        "Abstract": "The development of massively parallel sequencing (or next-generation sequencing) has facilitated a rapid implementation of genomic sequencing in clinical medicine. Genomic sequencing (GS) is now an essential tool for evaluating rare disorders, identifying therapeutic targets in neoplasms, and screening for prenatal aneuploidy. Emerging applications, such as GS for preconception carrier screening and predisposition screening in healthy individuals, are being explored in research settings and utilized by members of the public eager to incorporate genomic information into their health management. The rapid pace of adoption has created challenges for all stakeholders in clinical GS, from standardizing variant interpretation approaches in clinical molecular laboratories to ensuring that nongeneticist clinicians are prepared for new types of clinical information. Clinical GS faces a pivotal moment, as the vast potential of new quantities and types of data enable further clinical innovation and complicated implementation questions continue to be resolved.",
