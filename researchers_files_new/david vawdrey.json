        "Abstract": "Self-report is purported to be the gold standard for collecting demographic information. Many entry forms include a free-text \"write-in\" option in addition to structured responses. Balancing the flexibility of free-text with the value of collecting data in a structured format is a challenge if the data are to be useful for measuring and mitigating health disparities. While much work has been done to improve collection of race and ethnicity information, how to best collect data related to sexual and gender minority status and military veteran status has been less commonly studied. We analyzed 3,381 patient-provided free-text responses collected via a patient portal for gender identity, sexual orientation, pronouns, and veteran experiences. We identified common responses to better understand our patient population and help improve future iterations of data collection tools.",

        "Abstract": "With widespread electronic health record (EHR) adoption and improvements in health information interoperability in the United States, troves of data are available for knowledge discovery. Several data sharing programs and tools have been developed to support research activities, including efforts funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), EHR vendors, and other public- and private-sector entities. We surveyed 65 leading research institutions (77% response rate) about their use of and value derived from ten programs/tools, including NIH's Accrual to Clinical Trials, Epic Corporation's Cosmos, and the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics consortium. Most institutions participated in multiple programs/tools but reported relatively low usage (even when they participated, they frequently indicated that fewer than one individual/month benefitted from the platform to support research activities). Our findings suggest that investments in research data sharing have not yet achieved desired results.",

        "Abstract": "Between March 2020 and February 2022, use of telemedicine services in the U.S. shifted dramatically in response to the evolving SARS-CoV2 pandemic. The initial wave caused many non-emergent clinical services to be postponed, including specialty care clinic visits, which were rapidly converted to telemedicine encounters. Telemedicine use ebbed and flowed with subsequent pandemic waves. This paper describes trends in telemedicine use from March 2020-February 2022 at Geisinger, a predominantly rural integrated health system. It highlights characteristics of 5,390 virtual vs. 15,740 in-person clinic visits to neurosurgery and gastroenterology specialists in December 2021 and January 2022. Differences in ordering of diagnostic testing and prescription medications, as well as post-clinic-visit utilization, varied by specialty. Virtual visits in these specialties saved patients from traveling over 174,700 miles/month to attend appointments. Analyzing telemedicine use patterns can inform future resource allocation and determine when virtual encounters can complement or replace in-person specialty care visits.",

        "Abstract": "The use of copy-paste in authoring clinical notes has been widely embraced by busy providers, but inappropriate copy-paste has been lambasted by critics for introducing risks related to patient safety and regulatory compliance. At an integrated academic health system with over 4,100 providers writing notes, we developed a pragmatic approach to assess the use of copy-paste. From January 1-December 31, 2020, approximately 2.3M inpatient notes and 6.6M ambulatory clinic notes were authored in our electronic health record. Of the inpatient notes, 42% used copy-paste, and 19% of overall note content was copied; in ambulatory notes, 18% used copy-paste and 12% of note content was copied. We describe an approach for including providers' copy-paste usage statistics into the ongoing professional practice evaluation process required for hospital accreditation, thereby offering individual training opportunities related to the lack of use of copy-paste or its potential overuse.",

Many health-care organizations are working to collect sexual orientation and gender identity in their electronic health records (EHRs), with the goal of providing more inclusive care to their LGBTQ+ patients. There are significant human and technical barriers to making these efforts successful. Based on our 5-year experience at Geisinger (an integrated health system located in a rural, generally conservative area), this case report provides insights to overcome challenges in 4 critical areas: (1) enabling the EHR to collect and use information to support the health-care needs of LGBTQ+ patients, (2) building a culture of awareness and caring, empowering members of the health-care team to break down barriers of misunderstanding and mistrust, (3) developing services to support the needs of LGBTQ+ patients, and (4) partnering with local communities to become a trusted health-care provider.",

        "Abstract": "The recognition, disambiguation, and expansion of medical abbreviations and acronyms is of upmost importance to prevent medically-dangerous misinterpretation in natural language processing. To support recognition, disambiguation, and expansion, we present the Medical Abbreviation and Acronym Meta-Inventory, a deep database of medical abbreviations. A systematic harmonization of eight source inventories across multiple healthcare specialties and settings identified 104,057 abbreviations with 170,426 corresponding senses. Automated cross-mapping of synonymous records using state-of-the-art machine learning reduced redundancy, which simplifies future application. Additional features include semi-automated quality control to remove errors. The Meta-Inventory demonstrated high completeness or coverage of abbreviations and senses in new clinical text, a substantial improvement over the next largest repository (6-14% increase in abbreviation coverage; 28-52% increase in sense coverage). To our knowledge, the Meta-Inventory is the most complete compilation of medical abbreviations and acronyms in American English to-date. The multiple sources and high coverage support application in varied specialties and settings. This allows for cross-institutional natural language processing, which previous inventories did not support. The Meta-Inventory is available at https://bit.ly/github-clinical-abbreviations .",

        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and abnormal blood glucose is an important risk factor. Delayed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus can increase patients' morbidity. In an urban academic medical center with a large clinical data warehouse, we used a novel algorithm to identify 56,794 family members of diabetic patients that were eligible for disease screening. We found that 30.6% of patients did not receive diabetes screening as recommended by current guidelines. Further, our analysis showed that having more than one family member affected and being a female were important contributors to being screened for diabetes mellitus. This study demonstrates that informatics methods applied to electronic health record data can be used to identify patients at risk for disease development, and therefore support clinical care.",

However, few studies have assessed provider's perceptions of an acute care portal after implementation. In this study, we surveyed 63 nurses, physicians, and physician assistants following a 3-year randomized trial of an acute care portal. The survey assessed providers' perceptions of the portal and its impact on care delivery. Respondents reported that the portal positively impacted care, and they perceived that their patients found it usable and trustworthy. Respondents reported that all the portal's features were useful, especially the display of laboratory test results. Compared with the results of a patient survey, providers underestimated the portal's usefulness to patients, and ranked features as ",

In this study, we assessed the quality of smoking status captured in an electronic health record from a large academic medical center. We analyzed data from structured notes, finding that smoking status was documented in 98% of 64,451 hospital encounters in 2016. 32% hospital encounters had discrepant documentation, and 54.5% of patients had implausible changes (e.g., changes from \"current smoker\" to \"never smoker\"). Overall, only 2.9% of patients were documented as active smokers, but 36.4% were documented as \"unknown\" or had discrepancies in their smoking status. These results suggest that patients that smoke are not appropriately identified. Centralized documentation with clinically actionable smoking status categories and implementation of patient-facing tools that allow patients to directly record their information could improve data quality of smoking status.",

        "Abstract": "Though several institutions offer hospitalized patients access to their medical records through acute care patient portals, no studies have assessed the potential impact of patients' access to physicians' notes through these systems. We employed a mixed-methods approach, including patient surveys, system usage log analysis, and qualitative interviews, to describe patients' perspectives on receiving their clinical notes and usage of the clinical notes feature in an acute care patient portal. Patients visited the clinical notes feature more frequently and for longer durations than any other feature. In qualitative interviews, patients reported improved access to information, better insight into their conditions, decreased anxiety, increased appreciation for clinicians, improvements in health behaviors, and more engagement in care. Our results suggest that sharing notes with hospitalized patients is feasible and beneficial, although further studies should investigate the magnitude of benefit and explore the unintended negative consequences associated with increased transparency of clinical information.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical data warehouses, initially directed towards clinical research or financial analyses, are evolving to support quality improvement efforts, and must now address the quality improvement life cycle. In addition, data that are needed for quality improvement often do not reside in a single database, requiring easier methods to query data across multiple disparate sources. We created a virtual data warehouse at NewYork Presbyterian Hospital that allowed us to bring together data from several source systems throughout the organization. We also created a framework to match the maturity of a data request in the quality improvement life cycle to proper tools needed for each request. As projects progress in the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control stages of quality improvement, there is a proper matching of resources the data needs at each step. We describe the analysis and design creating a robust model for applying clinical data warehousing to quality improvement.",

NewYork-Presbyterian has designed and developed a real-time patient monitoring system that integrates vital signs sensors, networking, and electronic health records, to allow for automatic charting of patient status. We evaluate the representativeness (a combination of agreement, safety and timing) of a core vital sign across nursing intensity care protocols for preliminary feasibility assessment. Our findings suggest an automated way of summarizing heart rate provides representation of true heart rate status and can facilitate alternatives approaches to burdensome manual nurse charting of physiological parameters.",

However, internet access through traditional methods may be limited for populations most at risk for fragmented care. A convenience sample of postpartum women at a community hospital and tertiary-care academic center in New York City completed a self-administered survey. Most (75.2%, n = 200) women approached participated. The majority (70.0%) were Latina, 53.5% were Spanish speakers, 23.4% were uninsured, and 41.6% were publicly insured. Smartphone ownership (85.6%) including a data plan (80.0%) was high. While insurance and educational level were associated with decreased odds of internet access at home, access via cellphone only differed by age. Nearly all (94%) women wanted PHR access and interest only differed by language. Even the minority (20.0%) of women with concerns, reported high (93.8%) interest. High smartphone ownership, use of phone for internet access, and interest in PHR access, suggest the potential of optimizing PHR use via mobile technologies.",

While patient engagement has been a focus in the outpatient setting, strategies to engage inpatients in their care have not been well studied. We are undertaking a study to assess how patients' information needs during hospitalization can be addressed with health information technologies. To achieve this aim, we developed a personalized inpatient portal that allows patients to see who is on their care team, monitor their vital signs, review medications being administered, review current and historical lab and test results, confirm allergies, document pain scores and send questions and comments to inpatient care providers. The purpose of this paper is to describe the protocol for the study.",

        "Abstract": "The rapidly expanding use of electronic records in health-care settings is generating unprecedented quantities of data available for clinical, epidemiological, and cost-effectiveness research. Several challenges are associated with using these data for clinical research, including issues surrounding access and information security, poor data quality, inconsistency of data within and across institutions, and a paucity of staff with expertise to manage and manipulate large clinical data sets. In this article, we describe our experience with assembling a data-mart and conducting clinical research using electronic data from four facilities within a single hospital network in New York City. We culled data from several electronic sources, including the institution's admission-discharge-transfer system, cost accounting system, electronic health record, clinical data warehouse, and departmental records. The final data-mart contained information for more than 760,000 discharges occurring from 2006 through 2012. Using categories identified by the National Institutes of Health Big Data to Knowledge initiative as a framework, we outlined challenges encountered during the development and use of a domain-specific data-mart and recommend approaches to overcome these challenges.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to track and report long-term outcomes, especially mortality, is essential for advancing clinical research. The purpose of this study was to present a framework for assessing the quality of mortality information in clinical research databases. Using the clinical data warehouse (CDW) at Columbia University Medical Center as a case study, we measured: 1) agreement in vital status between our institution's patient registration system and the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File (DMF), 2) the proportion of patients marked as deceased according to the DMF records who had subsequent visits to our institution, and 3) the proportion of patients still living according to Columbia's CDW who were over 100 and 120 years of age. Of 33,295 deaths recorded in our institution's patient registration system, 13,167 (39.5%) did not exist in the DMF. Of 315,037 patients in our CDW who marked as deceased according to the DMF, 2.1% had a subsequent clinical encounter at our institution. The proportion of patients still living according to Columbia's CDW who were over 100 and 120 years of age was 43.6% and 43.1%, respectively. These measures may be useful to other clinical research investigators seeking to assess the quality of mortality data (1-4).",

        "Abstract": "Research Data eXplorer (RedX) was designed to support self-service research data queries and cohort identification from clinical research databases. The primary innovation of RedX was the electronic health record view of patient data, to provide better contextual understanding for non-technical users in building complex data queries. The design of RedX around this need identified multiple functions that would use individual patient views to better understand population-based data, and vice-versa. During development, the more necessary and valuable components of RedX were refined, leading to a functional self-service query and cohort identification tool. However, with the improved capabilities and extensibility of other applications for data querying and navigation, our long-term implementation and dissemination plans have moved towards consolidation and alignment of RedX functions as enhancements in these other initiatives.",

To investigate on an international scale the current state of approaches for providing patients with access to their own clinical information, individuals from 16 countries, across six continents, participated in cross-sectional semi-structured interviews. Interview questions focused on social and cultural influences that affected patient engagement activities, government support for current and planned initiatives, data ownership models, and technical issues. Substantive initiatives for providing information to patients in the majority of countries interviewed are present; however, these initiatives were diverse in nature and stage of implementation. Efforts to improve patient access to data are active on a global-scale. There are many open questions about best practices and much can be learned by adopting an international perspective to guide future implementation efforts.",

In this study we assessed the quality of family history data captured in an established commercial electronic health record (EHR) at a large academic medical center. Because the EHR had no centralized location to store family history information, it was collected as part of clinical notes in structured or free-text format. We analyzed differences between 10,000 free-text and 9,121 structured family history observations. Each observation was classified according to disease presence/absence and family member affected (e.g., father, mother, etc.). The structured notes did not collect a complete family history as defined by standards endorsed by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; the free-text notes contained more information than the structured notes, but still not enough to be considered \"complete.\" Several barriers remain for collecting complete, useful family history data in electronic health records.",

        "Abstract": "Communication and information sharing are critical parts of teamwork in the hospital; however, achieving open and fluid communication can be challenging. Finding specific patient information within documentation can be difficult. Recent studies on handoff documentation tools show that resident handoff notes are increasingly used as an alternative information source by non-physician clinicians. Previous findings also show that residents have become aware of this unintended use. This study investigated the alignment of resident note updating patterns and team note viewing patterns based on usage log data of handoff notes. Qualitative interviews with clinicians were used to triangulate findings based on the log analysis. The study found that notes that were frequently updated were viewed significantly more frequently than notes updated less often (p < 2.2 × 10(-16)). Almost 44% of all notes had aligned frequency of views and updates. The considerable percentage (56%) of mismatched note utilization suggests an opportunity for improvement.",

        "Abstract": "For hospitalized patients, handoffs between providers affect continuity of care and increase the risk of medical errors. Most commercial electronic health record (EHR) systems lack dedicated tools to support patient handoff activities. We developed a collaborative application supporting patient handoff that is fully integrated with our commercial EHR. The application creates user-customizable printed reports with automatic inclusion of a variety of EHR data, including: allergies, medications, 24-hour vital signs, recent common laboratory test results, isolation requirements, and code status. It has achieved widespread voluntary use at our institution (6,100 monthly users; 700 daily reports generated), and we have distributed the application to several other institutions using the same EHR. Though originally designed for resident physicians, today about 50% of the application users are nurses, 40% are physicians/physician assistants/nurse practitioners, and 10% are pharmacists, social workers, and other allied health providers.",

Electronic health records (EHRs) are necessary to enable the Learning Health System; however, a source of frustration is that current systems fail to adequately support research needs. We propose a model for enhancing EHRs to collect structured and standards-based clinical research data during clinical encounters that promotes efficiency and computational reuse of quality data for both care and research. The model integrates Common Data Elements (CDEs) for clinical research into existing clinical documentation workflows, leveraging executable documentation guidance within the EHR to support coordinated, standardized data collection for both patient care and clinical research.",

        "Abstract": "The patient problem list, like administrative claims data, has become an important source of data for decision support, patient cohort identification, and alerting systems. A two-fold intervention to increase capture of problems on the problem list automatically - with minimal disruption to admitting and provider billing workflows - is described. For new patients with no prior data in the electronic health record, the intervention resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of problems recorded to the problem list (3.8 vs 2.9 problems post-and pre-intervention respectively, p value 2×10(-16)). The majority of problems were recorded in the first 24 hours of admission. The proportion of patients with at least one problem coded to the problem list within the first 24 hours increased from 94% to 98% before and after intervention (chi square 344, p value 2×10(-16)). ICD9 \"V codes\" connoting circumstances beyond disease were captured at a higher rate post intervention than before. Deyo/Charlson comorbidities derived from problem list data were more similar to those derived from claims data after the intervention than before (Jaccard similarity 0.3 post- vs 0.21 pre-intervention, p value 2×10(-16)). A workflow-sensitive, non-interruptive means of capturing provider-entered codes early in admission can improve both the quantity and content of problems on the patient problem list.",

        "Abstract": "Being a hospital patient can be isolating and anxiety-inducing. We conducted two experiments to better understand clinician and patient perceptions about giving patients access to their medical records during hospital encounters. The first experiment, a survey of physicians, nurses, and other care providers (N=53), showed that most respondents were comfortable with the idea of providing patients with their clinical information. Some expressed reservations that patients might misunderstand information and become unnecessarily alarmed or offended. In the second experiment, we provided eight hospital patients with a daily copy of their full medical record-including physician notes and diagnostic test results. From semi-structured interviews with seven of these patients, we found that they perceived the information as highly useful even if they did not fully understand complex medical terms. Our results suggest that increased patient information sharing in the inpatient setting is beneficial and desirable to patients, and generally acceptable to clinicians.",

        "Abstract": "Between 2008 and 2010, our academic medical center transitioned to electronic provider documentation using a commercial electronic health record system. For attending physicians, one of the most frustrating aspects of this experience was the system's failure to support their existing electronic billing workflow. Because of poor system integration, it was difficult to verify the supporting documentation for each bill and impractical to track whether billable notes had corresponding charges. We developed and deployed in 2011 an integrated billing application called \"iCharge\" that streamlines clinicians' documentation and billing workflow, and simultaneously populates the inpatient problem list using billing diagnosis codes. Each month, over 550 physicians use iCharge to submit approximately 23,000 professional service charges for over 4,200 patients. On average, about 2.5 new problems are added to each patient's problem list. This paper describes the challenges and benefits of workflow integration across disparate applications and presents an example of innovative software development within a commercial EHR framework.",

We investigated the information needs of emergency medicine clinicians in order to design an electronic dashboard to fill information gaps in the emergency department. An online survey was distributed to all emergency medicine physicians at a large, urban academic medical center. The survey response rate was 48% (52/109). The clinical information items reported to be most helpful while caring for patients in the emergency department were vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) reports, previous discharge summaries, and previous lab results. Brief structured interviews were also conducted with 18 clinicians during their shifts in the emergency department. From the interviews, three themes emerged: 1) difficulty accessing vital signs, 2) difficulty accessing point-of-care tests, and 3) difficulty comparing the current ECG with the previous ECG. An emergency medicine clinical dashboard was developed to address these difficulties.",

        "Abstract": "Handoffs are a critical component of coordinated patient care; however, poor handoffs have been associated with near misses and adverse events. To address this, national agencies have recommended standardizing handoffs, for example through the use of handoff documentation tools. Recent research suggests that handoff tools, typically designed for physicians, are often used by non-physician providers as information sources. In this study, we investigated patterns of edits of an electronic handoff tool in a large teaching hospital through examination of its usage log data. Qualitative interviews with clinicians were used to triangulate log data findings. The analysis showed that despite its primary focus on facilitating transitions of care, information in the handoff documentation tool was updated throughout the day. Interviews with residents confirmed that they purposefully updated information to make it available for other members of their patient care teams. This further reiterates the view of electronic handoff tools as facilitators of team communication and coordination. However, the study also showed considerable variability in the frequency of updates between different units and across different patients. Further research is required to understand what factors drive such diversity in the use of electronic handoff tool and whether this diversity can be used to make inferences about patients' conditions.",

        "Abstract": "In the 1990s, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital began developing a comprehensive, standards-based immunization information system. The system, known as EzVac, has been operational since 1998 and now includes information on 2 million immunizations administered to more than 260,000 individuals. The system exchanges data with multiple electronic health records, a public health immunization registry, and a standalone personal health record. EzVac modules have recently been incorporated into the OpenMRS application and are being used to enhance immunization efforts in developing nations. We report on our experience with developing and using the EzVac system for 1) clinical care, both in local and global settings, 2) public health reporting, 3) consumer engagement, and 4) clinical and informatics research. We emphasize the advantages of using health IT standards to facilitate immunization information exchange in each of these domains.",

        "Abstract": "Use of electronic alerts in clinical practice has had mixed effects on providers' prescribing practices. Little research has explored the use of electronic alerts for improving screening practices. New York City has one of the highest rates of HIV in the United States. Recent New York State legislation requires healthcare providers to offer an HIV test to patients aged 13-64 years during a clinical encounter. Adhering to this requirement is particularly challenging in emergency department (ED) settings, which are frequently overcrowded and under-resourced. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of an electronic \"hard-stop\" alert on HIV testing rates in the ED. Approximately four months of data were reviewed before and after the implementation of the alert. We found that use of the electronic alert significantly increased documentation of offering an HIV test (O.R. = 267.27, p&lt;0.001) and resulted in a significant increase in HIV testing. Findings from this study add to the current knowledge about the use of electronic alertsfor improving disease screening.",

EHR vendors seldom provide analytic tools for customers to maintain such content and monitor its usage. We developed an application for tracking order sets, documentation templates and clinical alerts in a commercial electronic health record. Using the application, we compared trends in order set creation and usage at two academic medical centers over a three-year period. In January 2012, one medical center had 873 order sets available to clinicians; the other had 787. Approximately 50-75 new order sets were added each year at each medical center. We found that 46% of order sets at the first medical center and 39% at the second medical center were unused over the three-year period.",

        "Abstract": "As patients are encouraged to become active participants in their own care, recent research has begun to explore the direct sharing of electronic health information with patients during hospital visits. The design of patient-facing views of clinical information is, however, a relatively recent line of inquiry. Research is needed to further understand guidelines for communicating specific types of information to hospital patients. In this work, we focus on cardiology patients' information needs related to their hospital medications. We assessed these needs to inform the design of interactive, electronic views of medication information for cardiology inpatients. We present results of in-situ interviews with 11 inpatients and 6 nurses in a cardiology step-down unit. Our findings suggest that cohesive trends in medication information needs exist across cardiology inpatients. We discuss interview results and their implications for the design of inpatient-facing information technology. We also discuss key ways in which electronic medication information, formatted for inpatient use, differs from that formatted for outpatient or transitional medication-management use.",

        "Abstract": "Adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to assist with clinical reasoning and streamline workflow; however, the data entry and review capabilities of most systems are suboptimal which may lead to workarounds. As an instance of a workaround, we examined nurses' use of optional free-text comments in EHR flowsheets to support clinical needs for data interpretation. This mixed-method study included: 1) Content analysis of comments, 2) Interviews with nurses. We performed a sub-analysis of flowsheet data for 201 patients that experienced a cardiac arrest and interviewed 5 acute care nurses. We found that nurses used workarounds in the EHR - despite the extra effort that they required - to convey clinically significant relationships and to communicate concerning events to physicians. EHRs should better support entry of clinical data that \"belongs together\" and enable messaging capabilities integrated with nurses' flowsheet documentation workflow.",

Using Apple iPad devices, the prototype application was provided to five patients in a cardiology step-down unit. We conducted detailed interviews to assess patients' knowledge of their inpatient care, as well as their perceptions of the usefulness of the application. While patients exhibited varying levels of comfort with using the tablet computer, they were highly enthusiastic about the application's ability to supply health information such as their inpatient medication histories and photographs of their care providers. Additional research is warranted to assess the benefit such applications may have for addressing inpatient information needs, enhancing patient-provider communication and improving patient satisfaction.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical documents frequently contain a list of a patient's medications. Missing information about the dosage, route, or frequency of a medication impairs clinical communication and may harm patients. We examined 253 medication lists. There were 181 lists (72%) with at least one medication missing a dose, route, or frequency. Missing information was judged to be potentially harmful in 47 of the lists (19% of 253) by three physician reviewers (kappa=0.69). We also observed that many lists contained additional information included as annotations, prompting a secondary thematic analysis of the annotations. Fifty-five of the 253 lists (22%) contained one or more annotations. The most frequent types of annotations were comments about the patient's medical history, the clinician's treatment plan changes, and the patient's adherence to a medication. Future development of electronic medication reconciliation tools to improve medication list completeness should also support annotating the medication list in a flexible manner.",

Little is known about the prevalence of, or factors associated with, 2009 H1N1 vaccine coverage in low-income, urban pediatric populations. This study evaluated 2009 H1N1 vaccination coverage in 19,643 children aged 6months to 18years receiving care at one of five community clinics associated with an academic medical center in a low-income community. Any (≥1 dose) and full coverage (1 dose for children ≥10years old, 2 doses for those <10years) was determined as of December 1, 2009 and the end of vaccination period (June 30, 2010). Multivariable analyses were used to assess the impact of race/ethnicity, age, insurance, gender, and language on vaccine coverage and timeliness. By December 1, only 16.6% of children had received one dose, and 5.3% had full coverage. By the end of the vaccination period, 36.2% had received at least one H1N1 dose and 23.6% had full coverage. On multivariable analysis, older age, minority race/ethnicity, and private insurance were negatively associated with vaccination by December 1 and end of vaccination period, even after accounting for attendance at a clinic visit. In future pandemics, when timely receipt of a new vaccine in large populations may be imperative, general vaccination programs as well as special targeted education and vaccine reminders for these at risk groups may be warranted.",

        "Abstract": "Many hospitals have experienced challenges with accomplishing the Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goal for medication reconciliation. Our institution implemented a fully electronic process for performing and documenting medication reconciliation at hospital admission. The process used a commercial EHR and relied on a longitudinal medication list called the \"Outpatient Medication Profile\" (OMP). Clinician compliance with documenting medication reconciliation was difficult to achieve, but approached 100% after a \"hard-stop\" reminder was implemented. We evaluated the impact of the process at a large urban academic medical center. Before the new process was adopted, the average number of medications contained in the OMP for a patient upon admission was <2. One year after adoption, the average number had increased to 4.7, and there were regular updates made to the list. Updating the OMP was predominantly done by physicians, NPs, and PAs (94%), followed by nurses (5%) and pharmacists (1%).",

We created an application within our commercial EHR that supports basic management of these checklists at two urban, academic medical centers. We collected and analyzed over 400,000 checklist tasks created in the application. We calculated the frequencies of terms and term-combinations (n-grams) in these lists, and compared these data with a previously described clinical task model. Our findings provide evidence for the generalizability of the original clinical task model, and provide the foundation for a more sophisticated physician checklist utility. This could contribute to improved efficiency and safety in patient care.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To support collaboration and clinician-targeted decision support, electronic health records (EHRs) must contain accurate information about patients' care providers. The objective of this study was to evaluate two approaches for care provider identification employed within a commercial EHR at a large academic medical center. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of EHR data for 121 patients in two cardiology wards during a four-week period. System audit logs of chart accesses were analyzed to identify the clinicians who were likely participating in the patients' hospital care. The audit log data were compared with two functions in the EHR for documenting care team membership: 1) a vendor-supplied module called \"Care Providers\", and 2) a custom \"Designate Provider\" order that was created primarily to improve accuracy of the attending physician of record documentation. RESULTS: For patients with a 3-5 day hospital stay, an average of 30.8 clinicians accessed the electronic chart, including 10.2 nurses, 1.4 attending physicians, 2.3 residents, and 5.4 physician assistants. The Care Providers module identified 2.7 clinicians/patient (1.8 attending physicians and 0.9 nurses). The Designate Provider order identified 2.1 clinicians/patient (1.1 attending physicians, 0.2 resident physicians, and 0.8 physician assistants). Information about other members of patients' care teams (social workers, dietitians, pharmacists, etc.) was absent. CONCLUSIONS: The two methods for specifying care team information failed to identify numerous individuals involved in patients' care, suggesting that commercial EHRs may not provide adequate tools for care team designation. Improvements to EHR tools could foster greater collaboration among care teams and reduce communication-related risks to patient safety.",

Frequent handoffs of patient care, high acuity of patient illness, and the increasing amount of available data complicate information exchange.

        "Abstract": "Effective communication is essential to safe and efficient patient care. We aimed to understand the current patterns and perceptions of communication of common goals in the ICU using the distributed cognition and clinical communication space theoretical frameworks. We conducted a focus group and 5 interviews with ICU clinicians and observed 59.5 hours of interdisciplinary ICU morning rounds. Clinicians used a CIS/CPOE system and paper artifacts for documentation; yet, preferred verbal communication as a method of information exchange because they perceived that the documentation was often not updated or efficient for information retrieval. These perceptions that the CIS/CPOE is a \"shift behind\" may lead to a further reliance on verbal information exchange, which is a valuable clinical communication activity, yet, is subject to information loss. Electronic documentation tools that, in real time, capture information that is currently verbally communicated may increase the effectiveness of communication.",

The expense of developing the interface across systems was minimal, and it was successfully incorporated within the vendor EHR. Users consistently used the legacy data view while using the EHR; usage reached up to 50% of accessed data. Data showing concurrent increases in the use of the legacy data view and adoption of the new EHR suggests the method may improve adoption of the new system.",

At a healthcare institution comprising two large academic medical centers, a documentation management data mart and a custom, Web-accessible business intelligence application were developed to track the availability and usage of electronic documentation templates. For each medical center, template availability and usage trends were measured from November 2007 through February 2008. By February 2008, approximately 65,000 electronic notes were authored per week on the two campuses. One site had 934 available templates, with 313 being used to author at least one note. The other site had 765 templates, of which 480 were used. The most commonly used template at both campuses was a free text note called \"Miscellaneous Nursing Note,\" which accounted for 33.3% of total documents generated at one campus and 15.2% at the other.",
