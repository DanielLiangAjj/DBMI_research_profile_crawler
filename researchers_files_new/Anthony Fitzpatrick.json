        "Abstract": "Ponderomotive phase plates have shown that temporally consistent phase contrast is possible within electron microscopes via high-fluence static laser modes resonating in Fabry-Perot cavities. Here, we explore using pulsed laser beams as an alternative method of generating high fluences. We find through forward-stepping finite element models that picosecond or shorter interactions are required for meaningful fluences and phase shifts, with higher pulse energies and smaller beam waists leading to predicted higher fluences. An additional model based on quasi-classical assumptions is used to discover the shape of the phase plate by incorporating the oscillatory nature of the electric field. From these results, we find the transient nature of the laser pulses removes the influence of Kapitza-Dirac diffraction patterns that appear in the static resonator cases. We conclude by predicting that a total laser pulse energy of 8.7 μJ is enough to induce the required π/2 phase shift for Zernike-like phase microscopy.",

        "Abstract": "As structural determination of protein complexes approaches atomic resolution, there is an increasing focus on conformational dynamics. Here we conceptualize the combination of two techniques which have become established in recent years: microcrystal electron diffraction and ultrafast electron microscopy. We show that the extremely low dose of pulsed photoemission still enables microED due to the strength of the electron bunching from diffraction of the protein crystals. Indeed, ultrafast electron diffraction experiments on protein crystals have already been demonstrated to be effective in measuring intermolecular forces in protein microcrystals. We discuss difficulties that may arise in the acquisition and processing of data and the overall feasibility of the experiment, paying specific attention to dose and signal-to-noise ratio. In doing so, we outline a detailed workflow that may be effective in minimizing the dose on the specimen. A series of model systems that would be good candidates for initial experiments is provided.",

        "Abstract": "Misfolding and aggregation of disease-specific proteins, resulting in the formation of filamentous cellular inclusions, is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disease with characteristic filament structures, or conformers, defining each proteinopathy. Here we show that a previously unsolved amyloid fibril composed of a 135 amino acid C-terminal fragment of TMEM106B is a common finding in distinct human neurodegenerative diseases, including cases characterized by abnormal aggregation of TDP-43, tau, or α-synuclein protein. A combination of cryoelectron microscopy and mass spectrometry was used to solve the structures of TMEM106B fibrils at a resolution of 2.7 Å from postmortem human brain tissue afflicted with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP, n = 8), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, n = 2), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 1). The commonality of abundant amyloid fibrils composed of TMEM106B, a lysosomal/endosomal protein, to a broad range of debilitating human disorders indicates a shared fibrillization pathway that may initiate or accelerate neurodegeneration.",

Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of tau filaments from corticobasal degeneration (CBD) human brain tissue. Cryo-EM and mass spectrometry of tau filaments from CBD reveal that this conformer is heavily decorated with posttranslational modifications (PTMs), enabling us to map PTMs directly onto the structures. By comparing the structures and PTMs of tau filaments from CBD and Alzheimer's disease, it is found that ubiquitination of tau can mediate inter-protofilament interfaces. We propose a structure-based model in which cross-talk between PTMs influences tau filament structure, contributing to the structural diversity of tauopathy strains. Our approach establishes a framework for further elucidating the relationship between the structures of polymorphic fibrils, including their PTMs, and neurodegenerative disease.",

A wide variety of proteins and peptides can be involved, with aggregation originating from a natively folded or a natively unstructured species. Large deposits of amyloid fibrils are typically associated with cell death in late stage pathology. In this review, we illustrate the contributions of cryo-EM and related methods to the structure determination of amyloid fibrils extracted post mortem from patient brains or formed in vitro. We also discuss cell models of protein aggregation and the contributions of electron tomography to understanding the cellular context of aggregation.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and there are no mechanism-based therapies. The disease is defined by the presence of abundant neurofibrillary lesions and neuritic plaques in the cerebral cortex. Neurofibrillary lesions comprise paired helical and straight tau filaments, whereas tau filaments with different morphologies characterize other neurodegenerative diseases. No high-resolution structures of tau filaments are available. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps at 3.4-3.5 Å resolution and corresponding atomic models of paired helical and straight filaments from the brain of an individual with Alzheimer's disease. Filament cores are made of two identical protofilaments comprising residues 306-378 of tau protein, which adopt a combined cross-β/β-helix structure and define the seed for tau aggregation. Paired helical and straight filaments differ in their inter-protofilament packing, showing that they are ultrastructural polymorphs. These findings demonstrate that cryo-EM allows atomic characterization of amyloid filaments from patient-derived material, and pave the way for investigation of a range of neurodegenerative diseases.",

These transport processes are energized by the ATPase MacB, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. We present an electron cryo-microscopy structure of the ABC-type tripartite assembly at near-atomic resolution. A hexamer of the periplasmic protein MacA bridges between a TolC trimer in the outer membrane and a MacB dimer in the inner membrane, generating a quaternary structure with a central channel for substrate translocation. A gating ring found in MacA is proposed to act as a one-way valve in substrate transport. The MacB structure features an atypical transmembrane domain with a closely packed dimer interface and a periplasmic opening that is the likely portal for substrate entry from the periplasm, with subsequent displacement through an allosteric transport mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "Squeaking in ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) total hip arthroplasty (THA) was investigated with an acoustic monitoring device to distinguish between squeaking emanating from the trunnion morse taper (TMT) connection versus the articular surface. 82 patients with implant problems scheduled for revision were selected and acoustic emissions (AE) with simple movements monitored. Five of these patients with CoC implants underwent surgery and their retrieved implant components were analyzed in vitro. In vivo recordings of all 82 patients found audible squeaks produce frequency content across the entire 0-50 kHz spectrum. Of the five CoC implants the in vivo peak frequency range of flexion/extension motions was 0.8 kHz and comparable to the range of in vitro testing (0.2 kHz). In vitro TMT connection motions were very large comparatively, producing a higher average peak frequency range of 22.5 kHz. All retrieved implants showed evidence of wear at the TMT connection. These findings suggest, the TMT connection does not directly cause audible squeaking. Wear occurring at this junction may contribute to debris which disrupt lubrication, increase friction, and produce noise. This observation supports current evidence suggesting that squeaking is from the bearing surface. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that in CoC THA the recordable noise of a hip squeak does not originate nor have contribution from the TMT connection. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

        "Abstract": "The amyloid state of polypeptides is a stable, highly organized structural form consisting of laterally associated β-sheet protofilaments that may be adopted as an alternative to the functional, native state. Identifying the balance of forces stabilizing amyloid is fundamental to understanding the wide accessibility of this state to peptides and proteins with unrelated primary sequences, various chain lengths, and widely differing native structures. Here, we use four-dimensional electron microscopy to demonstrate that the forces acting to stabilize amyloid at the atomic level are highly anisotropic, that an optimized interbackbone hydrogen-bonding network within β-sheets confers 20 times more rigidity on the structure than sequence-specific sidechain interactions between sheets, and that electrostatic attraction of protofilaments is only slightly stronger than these weak amphiphilic interactions. The potential biological relevance of the deposition of such a highly anisotropic biomaterial in vivo is discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Protein magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy has generated structural models of several amyloid fibril systems, thus providing valuable information regarding the forces and interactions that confer the extraordinary stability of the amyloid architecture. Despite these advances, however, obtaining atomic resolution information describing the higher levels of structural organization within the fibrils remains a significant challenge. Here, we detail MAS NMR experiments and sample labeling schemes designed specifically to probe such higher order amyloid structure, and we have applied them to the fibrils formed by an eleven-residue segment of the amyloidogenic protein transthyretin (TTR(105-115)). These experiments have allowed us to define unambiguously not only the arrangement of the peptide β-strands into β-sheets but also the β-sheet interfaces within each protofilament, and in addition to identify the nature of the protofilament-to-protofilament contacts that lead to the formation of the complete fibril. Our efforts have resulted in 111 quantitative distance and torsion angle restraints (10 per residue) that describe the various levels of structure organization. The experiments benefited extensively from the use of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which in some cases allowed us to shorten the data acquisition time from days to hours and to improve significantly the signal-to-noise ratios of the spectra. The β-sheet interface and protofilament interactions identified here revealed local variations in the structure that result in multiple peaks for the exposed N- and C-termini of the peptide and in inhomogeneous line-broadening for the residues buried within the interior of the fibrils.",

The resulting chemical shift values were then used to evaluate the distribution of secondary structure populations which, in the absence of stable tertiary contacts, are a most effective way to describe the conformational fluctuations of disordered proteins. The results indicate that, at least within the bacterial cytosol, α-synuclein populates a highly dynamic state that, despite the highly crowded environment, has the same characteristics as the disordered monomeric form observed in aqueous solution.",

        "Abstract": "Amyloid is an important class of proteinaceous material because of its close association with protein misfolding disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes. Although the degree of stiffness of amyloid is critical to the understanding of its pathological and biological functions, current estimates of the rigidity of these β-sheet-rich protein aggregates range from soft (10(8) Pa) to hard (10(10) Pa) depending on the method used. Here, we use time-resolved 4D EM to directly and noninvasively measure the oscillatory dynamics of freestanding, self-supporting amyloid beams and their rigidity. The dynamics of a single structure, not an ensemble, were visualized in space and time by imaging in the microscope an amyloid-dye cocrystal that, upon excitation, converts light into mechanical work. From the oscillatory motion, together with tomographic reconstructions of three studied amyloid beams, we determined the Young modulus of these highly ordered, hydrogen-bonded β-sheet structures. We find that amyloid materials are very stiff (10(9) Pa). The potential biological relevance of the deposition of such a highly rigid biomaterial in vivo are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "The cross-β amyloid form of peptides and proteins represents an archetypal and widely accessible structure consisting of ordered arrays of β-sheet filaments. These complex aggregates have remarkable chemical and physical properties, and the conversion of normally soluble functional forms of proteins into amyloid structures is linked to many debilitating human diseases, including several common forms of age-related dementia. Despite their importance, however, cross-β amyloid fibrils have proved to be recalcitrant to detailed structural analysis. By combining structural constraints from a series of experimental techniques spanning five orders of magnitude in length scale--including magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction, cryoelectron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy--we report the atomic-resolution (0.5 Å) structures of three amyloid polymorphs formed by an 11-residue peptide. These structures reveal the details of the packing interactions by which the constituent β-strands are assembled hierarchically into protofilaments, filaments, and mature fibrils.",

We report here the finding that the balance between hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions is different for proteins in the processes of folding to their native states and misfolding to the alternative amyloid structures. We find that the minima of the protein free energy landscape for folding and misfolding tend to be respectively dominated by hydrophobic and by hydrogen bonding interactions. These results characterise the nature of the interactions that determine the competition between folding and misfolding of proteins by revealing that the stability of native proteins is primarily determined by hydrophobic interactions between side-chains, while the stability of amyloid fibrils depends more on backbone intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions.",

Various beta-sheet trimers are identified as free energy minima, including one that closely resembles the amyloid beta-sheet model previously proposed from experimental data. We characterize two alternative pathways leading to beta-sheets. The first proceeds via direct alpha to beta conversion without dissociation of the trimer, and the second can be classified as a dissociation/reassociation pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Protein molecules have the ability to form a rich variety of natural and artificial structures and materials. We show that amyloid fibrils, ordered supramolecular nanostructures that are self-assembled from a wide range of polypeptide molecules, have rigidities varying over four orders of magnitude, and constitute a class of high-performance biomaterials. We elucidate the molecular origin of fibril material properties and show that the major contribution to their rigidity stems from a generic interbackbone hydrogen-bonding network that is modulated by variable side-chain interactions.",
