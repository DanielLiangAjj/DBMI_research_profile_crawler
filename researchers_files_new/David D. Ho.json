        "Abstract": "Reports have described SARS-CoV-2 rebound in COVID-19 patients treated with nirmatrelvir, a 3CL protease inhibitor. The cause remains a mystery, although drug resistance, re-infection, and lack of adequate immune responses have been excluded. We now present virologic findings that provide a clue to the cause of viral rebound, which occurs in ∼20% of the treated cases. Persistence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was experimentally documented in vitro after treatment with nirmatrelvir or another 3CL protease inhibitor, but not with a polymerase inhibitor, remdesivir. This infectious form decayed slowly with a half-life of ∼1 day, suggesting that its persistence could outlive the treatment course to re-ignite SARS-CoV-2 infection as the drug is eliminated. Notably, extending nirmatrelvir treatment beyond 8 days abolished viral rebound in vitro. Our findings point in a particular direction for future investigation of virus persistence and offer a specific treatment recommendation that should be tested clinically.",

        "Abstract": "Over four years have passed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The scientific response has been rapid and effective, with many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and small molecules developed for clinical use. However, given the ability for viruses to become resistant to antivirals, it is perhaps no surprise that the field has identified resistance to nearly all of these compounds. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the resistance profile for each of these therapeutics. We hope that this resource provides an atlas for mutations to be aware of for each agent, particularly as a springboard for considerations for the next generation of antivirals. Finally, we discuss the outlook and thoughts for moving forward in how we continue to manage this, and the next, pandemic.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2.75 has diversified into multiple subvariants with additional spike mutations and several are expanding in prevalence, particularly CH.1.1 and BN.1. Here, we investigated the viral receptor affinities and neutralization evasion properties of major BA.2.75 subvariants actively circulating in different regions worldwide. We found two distinct evolutionary pathways and three newly identified mutations that shaped the virological features of these subvariants. One phenotypic group exhibited a discernible decrease in viral receptor affinities, but a noteworthy increase in resistance to antibody neutralization, as exemplified by CH.1.1, which is apparently as resistant as XBB.1.5. In contrast, a second group demonstrated a substantial increase in viral receptor affinity but only a moderate increase in antibody evasion, as exemplified by BN.1. We also observed that all prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants in the circulation presently, except for BN.1, exhibit profound levels of antibody evasion, suggesting this is the dominant determinant of virus transmissibility today.",

        "Abstract": "To combat the evolving SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants, bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, encoding both ancestral and Omicron BA.5 spikes, have replaced monovalent vaccines in numerous countries. However, fourth doses of either vaccine result in similar neutralizing antibody titers against Omicron subvariants, raising the possibility of immunological imprinting. To address this, we investigate antibody responses in 72 participants given three doses of a monovalent mRNA vaccine, followed by a bivalent or monovalent booster, or those with breakthrough infections with BA.5 or BQ. Bivalent boosters do not show notably higher binding or virus-neutralizing titers against various SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to monovalent ones. However, breakthrough infections lead to significantly better neutralization of Omicron subvariants. Multiple analyses, including antigenic mapping, suggest that the ancestral spike in bivalent vaccines is causing deep immunological imprinting, preventing broadening of antibodies to the BA.5 component, thereby defeating its intended goal. Its removal from future vaccine compositions is therefore strongly recommended.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, with many variants evading clinically authorized antibodies. To isolate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with broadly neutralizing capacities against the virus, we screened serum samples from convalescing COVID-19 patients. We isolated two mAbs, 12-16 and 12-19, which neutralized all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested, including the XBB subvariants, and prevented infection in hamsters challenged with Omicron BA.1 intranasally. Structurally, both antibodies targeted a conserved quaternary epitope located at the interface between the N-terminal domain and subdomain 1, uncovering a site of vulnerability on SARS-CoV-2 spike. These antibodies prevented viral receptor engagement by locking the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike in the down conformation, revealing a mechanism of virus neutralization for non-RBD antibodies. Deep mutational scanning showed that SARS-CoV-2 could mutate to escape 12-19, but such mutations are rarely found in circulating viruses. Antibodies 12-16 and 12-19 hold promise as prophylactic agents for immunocompromised persons who do not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.",

        "Abstract": "Prophylactic vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have lowered the incidence of severe COVID-19, but emergence of viral variants that are antigenically distinct from the vaccine strains are of concern and additional, broadly acting preventive approaches are desirable. Here, we report on a glycolipid termed 7DW8-5 that exploits the host innate immune system to enable rapid control of viral infections in vivo. This glycolipid binds to CD1d on antigen-presenting cells and thereby stimulates NKT cells to release a cascade of cytokines and chemokines. The intranasal administration of 7DW8-5 prior to virus exposure significantly blocked infection by three different authentic variants of SARS-CoV-2, as well as by respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus, in mice or hamsters. We also found that this protective antiviral effect is both host-directed and mechanism-specific, requiring both the CD1d molecule and interferon-[Formula: see text]. A chemical compound like 7DW8-5 that is easy to administer and cheap to manufacture may be useful not only in slowing the spread of COVID-19 but also in responding to future pandemics long before vaccines or drugs are developed.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate identification of beneficial mutations is central to antibody design. Many knowledge-based (KB) computational approaches have been developed to predict beneficial mutations, but their accuracy leaves room for improvement. Thermodynamic integration (TI) is an alchemical free energy algorithm that offers an alternative technique for identifying beneficial mutations, but its performance has not been evaluated. In this study, we developed an efficient TI protocol with high accuracy for predicting binding free energy changes of antibody mutations. The improved TI method outperforms KB methods at identifying both beneficial and deleterious mutations. We observed that KB methods have higher accuracies in predicting deleterious mutations than beneficial mutations. A pipeline using KB methods to efficiently exclude deleterious mutations and TI to accurately identify beneficial mutations was developed for high-throughput mutation scanning. The pipeline was applied to optimize the binding affinity of a broadly sarbecovirus neutralizing antibody 10-40 against the circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant. Three identified beneficial mutations show strong synergy and improve both binding affinity and neutralization potency of antibody 10-40. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the three mutations improve the binding affinity of antibody 10-40 through the stabilization of an altered binding mode with increased polar and hydrophobic interactions. Above all, this study presents an accurate and efficient TI-based approach for optimizing antibodies and other biomolecules.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve and evade most existing neutralizing antibodies, including all clinically authorized antibodies. We have isolated and characterized two human monoclonal antibodies, 12-16 and 12-19, which exhibited neutralizing activities against all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested, including BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5. They also blocked infection in hamsters challenged with Omicron BA.1 intranasally. Structural analyses revealed both antibodies targeted a conserved quaternary epitope located at the interface between the N-terminal domain and subdomain 1, revealing a previously unrecognized site of vulnerability on SARS-CoV-2 spike. These antibodies prevent viral receptor engagement by locking the receptor-binding domain of spike in the down conformation, revealing a novel mechanism of virus neutralization for non-RBD antibodies. Deep mutational scanning showed that SARS-CoV-2 could mutate to escape 12-19, but the responsible mutations are rarely found in circulating viruses. Antibodies 12-16 and 12-19 hold promise as prophylactic agents for immunocompromised persons who do not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.",

        "Abstract": "A better understanding of the durability and breadth of serum-neutralizing antibody responses against multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants elicited by COVID-19 vaccines is crucial in addressing the current pandemic. In this study, we quantified the decay of serum neutralization antibodies (nAbs) after second and third doses of the original COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Using an authentic virus-neutralization assay, we found that decay half-lives of WA1- and Delta-nAbs were both ∼60 days after second and third vaccine dose. Unexpectedly, the durability of serum antibodies that neutralize three different Omicron subvariants (BA.1.1, BA.5, BA.2.12.1) was substantially better, with half-lives of ≥6 months. A booster dose of the original COVID-19 vaccine was also found to broaden antibody responses against SARS-CoV and four other sarbecoviruses, in addition to multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains. These findings suggest that repeated vaccinations with the COVID-19 vaccine may confer a degree of protection against future spillover of sarbecoviruses from animal reservoirs.",

        "Abstract": "The BQ and XBB subvariants of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron are now rapidly expanding, possibly due to altered antibody evasion properties deriving from their additional spike mutations. Here, we report that neutralization of BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB, and XBB.1 by sera from vaccinees and infected persons was markedly impaired, including sera from individuals boosted with a WA1/BA.5 bivalent mRNA vaccine. Titers against BQ and XBB subvariants were lower by 13- to 81-fold and 66- to 155-fold, respectively, far beyond what had been observed to date. Monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing the original Omicron variant were largely inactive against these new subvariants, and the responsible individual spike mutations were identified. These subvariants were found to have similar ACE2-binding affinities as their predecessors. Together, our findings indicate that BQ and XBB subvariants present serious threats to current COVID-19 vaccines, render inactive all authorized antibodies, and may have gained dominance in the population because of their advantage in evading antibodies.",

        "Abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron subvariant BA.2.75 emerged recently and appears to be spreading. It has nine mutations in spike compared with the currently circulating BA.2, raising concerns that it may further evade vaccine-elicited and therapeutic antibodies. We found BA.2.75 to be moderately more neutralization resistant to sera from vaccinated/boosted individuals than BA.2 (1.8-fold), similar to BA.2.12.1 (1.1-fold), but more neutralization sensitive than BA.4/5 (0.6-fold). Relative to BA.2, BA.2.75 showed heightened resistance to class 1 and class 3 monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike-receptor-binding domain while gaining sensitivity to class 2 antibodies. Resistance was largely conferred by G446S and R460K mutations. BA.2.75 was slightly resistant (3.7-fold) to bebtelovimab, a therapeutic antibody with potent activity against all Omicron subvariants. BA.2.75 also exhibited a higher binding affinity to host receptor ACE2 than other Omicron subvariants. BA.2.75 provides further insight into SARS-CoV-2 evolution as it gains transmissibility while incrementally evading antibody neutralization.",

        "Abstract": "The devastation caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made clear the importance of pandemic preparedness. To address future zoonotic outbreaks due to related viruses in the sarbecovirus subgenus, we identified a human monoclonal antibody, 10-40, that neutralized or bound all sarbecoviruses tested in vitro and protected against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in vivo. Comparative studies with other receptor-binding domain (RBD)-directed antibodies showed 10-40 to have the greatest breadth against sarbecoviruses, suggesting that 10-40 is a promising agent for pandemic preparedness. Moreover, structural analyses on 10-40 and similar antibodies not only defined an epitope cluster in the inner face of the RBD that is well conserved among sarbecoviruses but also uncovered a distinct antibody class with a common CDRH3 motif. Our analyses also suggested that elicitation of this class of antibodies may not be overly difficult, an observation that bodes well for the development of a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine.",

        "Abstract": "The within-host viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they relate to a person's infectiousness are not well understood. This limits our ability to quantify the impact of interventions on viral transmission. Here, we develop viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and fit them to data to estimate key within-host parameters such as the infected cell half-life and the within-host reproductive number. We then develop a model linking viral load (VL) to infectiousness and show a person's infectiousness increases sublinearly with VL and that the logarithm of the VL in the upper respiratory tract is a better surrogate of infectiousness than the VL itself. Using data on VL and the predicted infectiousness, we further incorporated data on antigen and RT-PCR tests and compared their usefulness in detecting infection and preventing transmission. We found that RT-PCR tests perform better than antigen tests assuming equal testing frequency; however, more frequent antigen testing may perform equally well with RT-PCR tests at a lower cost but with many more false-negative tests. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for inferring the impact of therapeutics and vaccines that lower VL on the infectiousness of individuals and for evaluating rapid testing strategies.",

        "Abstract": "The within-host viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they relate to a person's infectiousness are not well understood. This limits our ability to quantify the impact of interventions on viral transmission. Here, we develop data-driven viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and estimate key within-host parameters such as the infected cell half-life and the within-host reproductive number. We then develop a model linking VL to infectiousness, showing that a person's infectiousness increases sub-linearly with VL. We show that the logarithm of the VL in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is a better surrogate of infectiousness than the VL itself. Using data on VL and the predicted infectiousness, we further incorporated data on antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and compared their usefulness in detecting infection and preventing transmission. We found that RT-PCR tests perform better than antigen tests assuming equal testing frequency; however, more frequent antigen testing may perform equally well with RT-PCR tests at a lower cost, but with many more false-negative tests. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for inferring the impact of therapeutics and vaccines that lower VL on the infectiousness of individuals and for evaluating rapid testing strategies.",

The relative resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to antibody neutralization has been recently investigated. We report that another emergent variant from Brazil, P.1, is not only refractory to multiple neutralizing monoclonal antibodies but also more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma and vaccinee sera. The magnitude of resistance is greater for monoclonal antibodies than vaccinee sera and evident with both pseudovirus and authentic P.1 virus. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of a soluble prefusion-stabilized spike reveals that the P.1 trimer adopts exclusively a conformation in which one of the receptor-binding domains is in the \"up\" position, which is known to facilitate binding to entry receptor ACE2. The functional impact of P.1 mutations thus appears to arise from local changes instead of global conformational alterations. The P.1 variant threatens current antibody therapies but less so protective vaccine efficacy.",

        "Abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has ravaged the globe, and its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, continues to rage. Prospects of ending this pandemic rest on the development of effective interventions. Two monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have received emergency use authorization, and more are in the pipeline. Furthermore, multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise, including two with ~95% protective efficacy against Covid-19. However, these interventions were directed toward the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019. Considerable viral evolution has occurred since, including variants with a D614G mutation that have become dominant. Viruses with this mutation alone do not appear to be antigenically distinct, however. Recent emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK and B.1.351 in South Africa is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. We now report that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike and relatively resistant to a number of mAbs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD). It is modestly more resistant to convalescent plasma (~3 fold) and vaccinee sera (~2 fold). Findings on B.1.351 are more worrisome in that this variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most NTD mAbs but also by multiple potent mAbs to the receptor-binding motif on RBD, largely due to an E484K mutation. Moreover, B.1.351 is markedly more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma (~11-33 fold) and vaccinee sera (~6.5-8.6 fold). B.1.351 and emergent variants with similar spike mutations present new challenges for mAb therapy and threaten the protective efficacy of current vaccines.",

        "Abstract": "We studied plasma antibody responses of 35 patients about 1 month after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Titers of antibodies binding to the viral nucleocapsid and spike proteins were significantly higher in patients with severe disease. Likewise, mean antibody neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live virus were higher in the sicker patients, by ∼5-fold and ∼7-fold, respectively. These findings have important implications for those pursuing plasma therapy, isolation of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, and determinants of immunity.",

        "Abstract": "In combating viral infections, the Fab portion of an antibody could mediate virus neutralization, whereas Fc engagement of Fc-γ receptors (FcγRs) could mediate an array of effector functions. Evidence abounds that effector functions are important in controlling infections by influenza, Ebola, or HIV-1 in animal models. However, the relative contribution of virus neutralization versus effector functions to the overall antiviral activity of an antibody remains unknown. To address this fundamental question in immunology, we utilized our knowledge of HIV-1 dynamics to compare the kinetics of the viral load decline (ΔVL) in infected animals given a wild-type (WT) anti-HIV-1 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) versus those given a Fc-Null variant of the same antibody. In three independent experiments in HIV-1-infected humanized mice and one pivotal experiment in simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected rhesus macaques, an earlier and sharper decline in viral load was consistently detected for the WT antibody. Quantifications of the observed differences indicate that Fc-mediated effector functions accounted for 25-45% of the total antiviral activity in these separate experiments. In this study, Fc-mediated effector functions have been quantified in vivo relative to the contribution of virus neutralization mediated by the Fab.",

        "Abstract": "With increasing frequency, humans are facing outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) with the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. In the most extreme instances, such outbreaks can become pandemics, as we are now witnessing with COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization, this new disease, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has already infected more than 10 million people worldwide and led to 499,913 deaths as of 29 June, 2020. How high these numbers will eventually go depends on many factors, including policies on travel and movement, availability of medical support, and, because there is no vaccine or highly effective treatment, the pace of biomedical research. Other than an approved antiviral drug that can be repurposed, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) hold the most promise for providing a stopgap measure to lessen the impact of an outbreak while vaccines are in development. Technical advances in mAb identification, combined with the flexibility and clinical experience of mAbs in general, make them ideal candidates for rapid deployment. Furthermore, the development of mAb cocktails can provide a faster route to developing a robust medical intervention than searching for a single, outstanding mAb. In addition, mAbs are well-suited for integration into platform technologies for delivery, in which minimal components need to be changed in order to be redirected against a novel pathogen. In particular, utilizing the manufacturing and logistical benefits of DNA-based platform technologies in order to deliver one or more antiviral mAbs has the potential to revolutionize EID responses.",

This screen identified IWS1, POLE3, POLR1B, PSMD1, and TGM2 as potential regulators of HIV-1 latency, of which PSMD1 and TMG2 could be confirmed pharmacologically. Further investigation of PSMD1 revealed that an interacting enzyme, the deubiquitinase UCH37, was also involved in HIV-1 latency. We therefore conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the deubiquitinase family by gene knockout, identifying several deubiquitinases, UCH37, USP14, OTULIN, and USP5 as possible HIV-1 latency regulators. A specific inhibitor of USP14, IU1, reversed HIV-1 latency and displayed synergistic effects with other latency reversal agents. IU1 caused degradation of TDP-43, a negative regulator of HIV-1 transcription. Collectively, this study is the first comprehensive evaluation of deubiquitinases in HIV-1 latency and establishes that they may hold a critical role.",

        "Abstract": "As increasing numbers of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against HIV-1 enter clinical trials, it is becoming evident that combinations of mAbs are necessary to block infection by the diverse array of globally circulating HIV-1 strains and to limit the emergence of resistant viruses. Multi-specific antibodies, in which two or more HIV-1 entry-targeting moieties are engineered into a single molecule, have expanded rapidly in recent years and offer an attractive solution that can improve neutralization breadth and erect a higher barrier against viral resistance. In some unique cases, multi-specific HIV-1 antibodies have demonstrated vastly improved antiviral potency due to increased avidity or enhanced spatiotemporal functional activity. This review will describe the recent advancements in the HIV-1 field in engineering monoclonal, bispecific and trispecific antibodies with enhanced breadth and potency against HIV-1. A case study will also be presented as an example of the developmental challenges these multi-specific antibodies may face on their path to the clinic. The tremendous potential of multi-specific antibodies against the HIV-1 epidemic is readily evident. Creativity in their discovery and engineering, and acumen during their development, will be the true determinant of their success in reducing HIV-1 infection and disease.",

Here, we describe an optimized electroporation-based DNA gene transfer platform technology that can be utilized for production of functional mAbs in vivo, with the potential to reduce costs and administration burdens. We demonstrate that multiple mAbs can be simultaneously expressed at protective concentrations for a protracted period of time using DNA doses and electroporation conditions that are feasible clinically. The expressed mAbs could also protect mice against lethal influenza or Ebola virus challenges. Our findings suggest that this DNA gene transfer platform technology could be a game-changing advance that expands access to effective mAb therapeutics globally.",

Passive immunization using broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1, with their relatively long half-life and favorable safety profile, could provide an alternative to daily preexposure prophylaxis. However, most bNAbs have a limited breadth, only neutralizing 70%-90% of all HIV-1 strains.",

However, the plasticity of HIV-1 demands additional improvements to these mAbs to better ensure their clinical utility. Here, we report engineered bispecific antibodies that are the most potent and broad HIV-neutralizing antibodies to date. One bispecific antibody, 10E8V2.0/iMab, neutralized 118 HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses tested with a mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.002 μg/mL. 10E8V2.0/iMab also potently neutralized 99% of viruses in a second panel of 200 HIV-1 isolates belonging to clade C, the dominant subtype accounting for ∼50% of new infections worldwide. Importantly, 10E8V2.0/iMab reduced virus load substantially in HIV-1-infected humanized mice and also provided complete protection when administered prior to virus challenge. These bispecific antibodies hold promise as novel prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents in the fight against HIV-1.",

        "Abstract": "Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive bacillus and is the leading cause of toxin-mediated nosocomial diarrhea following antibiotic use. C. difficile flagella play a role in colonization, adherence, biofilm formation, and toxin production, which might contribute to the overall virulence of certain strains. Human and animal studies indicate that anti-flagella immune responses may play a role in protection against colonization by C. difficile and subsequent disease outcome. Here we report that recombinant C. difficile flagellin (FliC) is immunogenic and protective in a murine model of C. difficile infection (CDI) against a clinical C. difficile strain, UK1. Passive protection experiments using anti-FliC polyclonal serum in mice suggest this protection to be antibody-mediated. FliC immunization also was able to afford partial protection against CDI and death in hamsters following challenge with C. difficile 630Δerm. Additionally, immunization against FliC does not have an adverse effect on the normal gut flora of vaccinated hamsters as evidenced by comparing the fecal microbiome of vaccinated and control hamsters. Therefore, the use of FliC as a vaccine candidate against CDI warrants further testing.",

These spore proteins are immunogenic in mice and are able to protect mice against challenge with C. difficile UK1, a clinically-relevant 027/B1/NAP1 strain.

GSK744 LA was administered at two time points 4 weeks apart beginning 1 week before virus administration, and macaques were challenged weekly for 8 weeks. GSK744 LA, at plasma concentrations achievable with quarterly injections in humans, protected all animals against repeated low-dose challenges. In a second experiment, macaques were given GSK744 LA 1 week before virus administration and challenged repeatedly until infection occurred. Protection decreased over time and correlated with the plasma drug levels. With a quarterly dosing schedule in humans, our results suggest that GSK744 LA could potentially decrease adherence problems associated with daily preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP).",

        "Abstract": "Ibalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds human CD4--a key receptor for HIV--and blocks HIV-1 infection. However, HIV-1 strains with mutations resulting in loss of an N-linked glycan from the V5 loop of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 are resistant to ibalizumab. Previous structural analysis suggests that this glycan fills a void between the gp120 V5 loop and the ibalizumab light chain, perhaps causing steric hindrance that disrupts viral entry. If this void contributes to HIV-1 resistance to ibalizumab, we reasoned that 'refilling' it by engineering an N-linked glycan into the ibalizumab light chain at a position spatially proximal to gp120 V5 may restore susceptibility to ibalizumab. Indeed, one such ibalizumab variant neutralized 100% of 118 diverse HIV-1 strains tested in vitro, including 10 strains resistant to parental ibalizumab. These findings demonstrate that the strategic placement of a glycan in the variable region of a monoclonal antibody can substantially enhance its activity.",

        "Abstract": "In the absence of an effective HIV-1 vaccine, passive immunization using broadly neutralizing Abs or Ab-like molecules could provide an alternative to the daily administration of oral antiretroviral agents that has recently shown promise as preexposure prophylaxis. Currently, no single broadly neutralizing Ab (bNAb) or combination of bNAbs neutralizes all HIV-1 strains at practically achievable concentrations in vivo. To address this problem, we created bispecific Abs that combine the HIV-1 inhibitory activity of ibalizumab (iMab), a humanized mAb directed to domain 2 of human CD4, with that of anti-gp120 bNAbs. These bispecific bNAbs (BibNAbs) exploit iMab's potent anti-HIV-1 activity and demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety to anchor and thereby concentrate a second broadly neutralizing agent at the site of viral entry. Two BibNabs, PG9-iMab and PG16-iMab, exhibit exceptional breadth and potency, neutralizing 100% of the 118 viruses tested at low picomolar concentrations, including viruses resistant to both parental mAbs. The enhanced potency of these BibNAbs was entirely dependent on CD4 anchoring, not on membrane anchoring per se, and required optimal Ab geometry and linker length. We propose that iMab-based BibNAbs, such as PG9-iMab and PG16-iMab, are promising candidates for passive immunization to prevent HIV-1 infection.",

        "Title": "Toll-like receptor 5-dependent immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant fusion protein vaccine containing the nontoxic domains of Clostridium difficile toxins A and B and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium flagellin in a mouse model of Clostridium difficile disease.",
        "Abstract": "Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming bacillus that produces toxin-mediated enteric disease. C. difficile expresses two major virulence factors, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB). Human and animal studies demonstrate a clear association between humoral immunity to these toxins and protection against C. difficile infection (CDI). The receptor binding-domains (RBDs) of TcdA and TcdB are known to be immunogenic. Here, we tested the immunoadjuvant properties of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium flagellin (FliC) subunit D1 as an innate immune agonist expressed as a recombinant fusion vaccine targeting the RBDs of TcdA and TcdB in mice. Intraperitoneally immunized mice developed prominent anti-TcdA and anti-TcdB immunoglobulin G in serum. The protective efficacy of the recombinant vaccines, with or without an adjuvant, was tested in a mouse model of CDI that closely represents the human disease. Following intraperitoneal immunization equivalent to two doses of toxoid A and toxoid B vaccine adjuvanted with alum and oral challenge with C. difficile VPI 10463, C57BL/6 mice were able to mount a protective immune response that prevented diarrhea and death compared to mice immunzed with alum alone. These results are significantly different from those for control mice (P < 0.001). These results provide evidence that a recombinant protein-based vaccine targeting the RBDs of the C. difficile toxins adjuvanted with S. Typhimurium flagellin can induce rapid, high-level protection in a mouse model of CDI when challenged with the homologous strain from which the vaccine antigens were derived and warrant further preclinical testing against clinically relevant C. difficile strains in the mouse and hamster models of CDI.",

        "Abstract": "The central role of dendritic cell (DC) in mounting an immune response to a novel antigen is now well established. We sought to demonstrate the use of a particular vaccine strategy based on directing HIV-1 Gag proteins to DCs in conjunction with an activation signal. CD40L was expressed on the surface of virus-like particles (VLPs) to target HIV-1 Gag antigens to the CD40 receptor on DCs, whereas CD40L-CD40 interaction would also result in cellular activation. Multiple CD40L VLP constructs were made and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, one VLP that expressed CD40L to the highest level showed greatest capacity to activate DCs in vitro. Correspondingly, this CD40L-VLP also proved to be most immunogenic in mice in raising both humoral and cellular responses to HIV-1 Gag. Confirmatory studies were performed to demonstrate the increased immunogenicity of CD40L-VLP is no longer observed when tested in CD40-/- mice. Our findings lend support to the belief that vaccine strategies that both target and activate DCs could yield a superior immune response.",

        "Abstract": "The failure to develop an effective vaccine against HIV-1 infection has led the research community to seek new ways of raising qualitatively different antibody and cellular immune responses. Towards this goal, we investigated the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain (YF17D), one of the most effective vaccines ever made, as a platform for HIV-1 vaccine development. A test antigen, HIV-1 p24 (clade B consensus), was inserted near the 5' end of YF17D, in frame and upstream of the polyprotein (YF-5'/p24), or between the envelope and the first non-structural protein (YF-E/p24/NS1). In vitro characterization of these recombinants indicated that the gene insert was more stable in the context of YF-E/p24/NS1. This was confirmed in immunogenicity studies in mice. CD8(+) IFN-gamma T-cell responses against p24 were elicited by the YF17D recombinants, as were specific CD4(+) T cells expressing IFN-gamma and IL-2. A balanced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell response was notable, as was the polyfunctionality of the responding cells. Finally, the protective efficacy of the YF17D recombinants, particularly YF-E/p24/NS1, in mice challenged with a vaccinia expressing HIV-1 Gag was demonstrated. These results suggest that YF17D warrants serious consideration as a live-attenuated vector for HIV-1 vaccine development.",

        "Abstract": "Ibalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds human CD4, the primary receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). With its unique specificity for domain 2 of CD4, this antibody potently and broadly blocks HIV-1 infection in vitro by inhibiting a postbinding step required for viral entry but without interfering with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)-mediated immune function. In clinical trials, ibalizumab has demonstrated anti-HIV-1 activity in patients without causing immunosuppression. Thus, a characterization of the ibalizumab epitope was conducted in an attempt to gain insight into the underlying mechanism of its antiviral activity as well as its safety profile. By studying mouse/human chimeric CD4 molecules and site-directed point mutants of CD4, amino acids L96, P121, P122, and Q163 in domain 2 were found to be important for ibalizumab binding, with E77 and S79 in domain 1 also contributing. All these residues appear to cluster on the interface between domains 1 and 2 of human CD4 on a surface opposite the site where gp120 and the MHC-II molecule bind on domain 1. Separately, the epitope of M-T441, a weakly neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody that competes with ibalizumab, was localized entirely within domain 2 on residues 123 to 125 and 138 to 140. The results reported herein not only provide an appreciation for why ibalizumab has not had significant adverse immunological consequences in infected patients to date but also raise possible steric hindrance mechanisms by which this antibody blocks HIV-1 entry into a CD4-positive cell.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) via breast-feeding by 104 Chinese mothers who acquired the infection through blood transfusion postnatally. Of 106 children, 38 (35.8%) were infected. All children survived to age 5 years, and their survival curve was similar to that of their mothers. These findings suggest a high rate of HIV-1 transmission via breast-feeding when mothers were infected postnatally via blood transfusion, perhaps because of the higher viremia expected during the acute phase of infection. The course of disease among infected children was significantly less rapid than that among newborns infected perinatally, suggesting that a brief window of HIV-1-free life often enables the immune system of an infant to stave off rapid disease progression.",

DNA vaccination has several advantages compared to traditional vaccine methods, however no study has examined this platform against C. difficile toxins. A synthetic gene was created encoding the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of C. difficile toxin A, optimized for expression in human cells. Gene expression was examined in vitro. Mice were inoculated and then challenged with parenteral toxin A. Vaccination provided high titer antibodies and protected mice from death.

        "Title": "A consensus-hemagglutinin-based DNA vaccine that protects mice against divergent H5N1 influenza viruses.",
        "Abstract": "H5N1 influenza viruses have spread extensively among wild birds and domestic poultry. Cross-species transmission of these viruses to humans has been documented in over 380 cases, with a mortality rate of approximately 60%. There is great concern that a H5N1 virus would acquire the ability to spread efficiently between humans, thereby becoming a pandemic threat. An H5N1 influenza vaccine must, therefore, be an integral part of any pandemic preparedness plan. However, traditional methods of making influenza vaccines have yet to produce a candidate that could induce potently neutralizing antibodies against divergent strains of H5N1 influenza viruses. To address this need, we generated a consensus H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) sequence based on data available in early 2006. This sequence was then optimized for protein expression before being inserted into a DNA plasmid (pCHA5). Immunizing mice with pCHA5, delivered intramuscularly via electroporation, elicited antibodies that neutralized a panel of virions that have been pseudotyped with the HA from various H5N1 viruses (clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.3.4). Moreover, immunization with pCHA5 in mice conferred complete (clades 1 and 2.2) or significant (clade 2.1) protection from H5N1 virus challenges. We conclude that this vaccine, based on a consensus HA, could induce broad protection against divergent H5N1 influenza viruses and thus warrants further study.",

        "Abstract": "Quantitation of replication-competent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in peripheral blood of infected individuals is critical for investigations of HIV pathogenesis and therapy. In this unit, the basic protocol determines the HIV titer in seropositive blood by measuring the tissue culture infectious dose (TCID) by an end-point dilution method. A second basic protocol utilizes the PHA-stimulated T cell blasts (activated T cells) in co-culture with PBMC as described in the first basic protocol for the short-term growth of HIV in vitro. An Alternate Protocol describes the accumulative method of determining 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) of HIV using the Reed-Muench equation when multiple replicates of a given sample are employed in the assay. A consequence of HIV infection is the depletion of CD4(+) target cells, evidenced by syncytia formation or single-cell death; two support protocols detail the evaluation of these cytopathic effects.",

        "Abstract": "An effective vaccine against HIV-1 is generally considered the best hope for controlling the raging AIDS pandemic. As a part of our AIDS vaccine development effort, we constructed a dual-promoter plasmid capable of high-level expression of 2 independent transgenes. HIV-1 gag, pol, env, nef, and tat from a primary subtype C/B' CCR5-tropic HIV-1 were \"codon\" optimized, modified to eliminate known functional activity, and assembled using an overlapping polymerase chain reaction into 2 plasmids: ADVAX-I (containing env and gag) and ADVAX-II (containing pol and nef-tat). These 2 dual-promoter candidate vaccines showed levels of HIV-1 gene expression comparable to those observed with single-gene plasmids in vitro. Importantly, immunization of mice with these vaccine constructs resulted in dose-dependent multigenic CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses equivalent to those provided by vaccination with single-gene plasmids. With input from the US Food and Drug Administration, ADVAX-I and ADVAX-II have since been combined as a single candidate DNA vaccine, ADVAX. A phase 1 clinical trial of this product has been successfully completed, and its use in prime-boost studies is now underway.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid spread of HIV-1 underscores the urgent need to develop an effective vaccine. Using modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) as a vector, we designed and constructed a multigenic candidate vaccine against a recombinant C/B' subtype of HIV-1 that is dominant in southwest China. Five HIV-1 genes (gag, pol, DeltaV2env, tat, and nef) were introduced into 2 separate regions of the MVA genome using modified single- and dual-promoter insertion vectors. Recombinant MVA was selected by immunofluorescence double-staining and foci purification. The end product is a single recombinant MVA, termed ADMVA, that expresses HIV-1 DeltaV2Env and fusion proteins Gag-Pol and Nef-Tat. By in vitro analyses, all expected HIV-1 proteins were expressed in infected chicken embryo fibroblasts and various human cell lines. Additionally, 2 sequential intramuscular injections of 10(6) 50% tissue infectious culture dose (TCID50) of ADMVA into BALB/c and B6 x B10 mice elicited broad cell-mediated immune responses against all 5 viral proteins as determined by interferon-gamma enzyme immunospot assays. The number of spot-forming cells was in the range of 200 to 800 per million splenocytes, and both CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were detected. Moreover, high serum titers (>1:20,000) of antibodies against HIV-1 gp120 were also elicited. The magnitude of immune responses correlated with the dose of ADMVA, and the vaccine caused no overt adverse consequences, up to 10(7) TCID50 per injection. ADMVA has since been advanced into clinical trials. A phase 1 study has been completed, and a prime-boost with ADVAX (see accompanying article) is now underway.",

Research has deepened our understanding of how the virus replicates, manipulates, and hides in an infected person. Although our understanding of pathogenesis and transmission dynamics has become more nuanced and prevention options have expanded, a cure or protective vaccine remains elusive. Antiretroviral treatment has transformed AIDS from an inevitably fatal condition to a chronic, manageable disease in some settings. This transformation has yet to be realised in those parts of the world that continue to bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV-1 infections and are most affected by increasing morbidity and mortality. This Seminar provides an update on epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention interventions pertinent to HIV-1.",

We investigated if anatomic distribution of DNA could enhance responses to decreasing DNA doses. We show that anatomic distribution of low-dose DNA improves cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in mice. Anatomic distribution of low-dose DNA provided a dose-sparing effect for both cell-mediated immunity and humoral responses. Enhanced systemic responses correlate directly with recruitment of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells in the regional lymph nodes. These results have implications for DNA vaccination in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Immunization with a killed or inactivated viral vaccine provides significant protection in animals against challenge with certain corresponding pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs). However, the promise of this approach in humans is hampered by serious concerns over the risk of leaking live severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses. In this study, we generated a SARS vaccine candidate by using the live-attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as a vector. The full-length SARS-CoV envelope Spike (S) glycoprotein gene was introduced into the deletion III region of the MVA genome. The newly generated recombinant MVA, ADS-MVA, is replication incompetent in mammalian cells and highly immunogenic in terms of inducing potent neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and monkeys. After two intramuscular vaccinations with ADS-MVA alone, the 50% inhibitory concentration in serum was achieved with reciprocal sera dilutions of more than 1,000- to 10,000-fold in these animals. Using fragmented S genes as immunogens, we also mapped a neutralizing epitope in the region of N-terminal 400 to 600 amino acids of the S glycoprotein (S400-600), which overlaps with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-binding region (RBR; S318-510). Moreover, using a recombinant soluble RBR-Fc protein, we were able to absorb and remove the majority of the neutralizing antibodies despite observing that the full S protein tends to induce a broader spectrum of neutralizing activities in comparison with fragmented S proteins. Our data suggest that a major mechanism for neutralizing SARS-CoV likely occurs through blocking the interaction between virus and the cellular receptor ACE2. In addition, ADS-MVA induced potent immune responses which very likely protected Chinese rhesus monkeys from pathogenic SARS-CoV challenge.",

        "Abstract": "China is facing a rapid upsurge in cases of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection due to large numbers of paid blood donors (PBD), injection drug users (IDU), and sexual partners of infected individuals. In this report, a total of 236 HIV-1-positive blood samples were collected from PBD, IDU, and their sexual partners in the most severely affected provinces, such as Henan, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Xinjiang. PCR was used to amplify the p17 region of gag and the C2-V3 region of env of HIV-1 and the 5' noncoding region and a region of E1/E2 of HCV. Genetic characterization of viral sequences indicated that there are two major epidemics of HIV-1 and multiple HCV epidemics in China. The PBD and transfusion recipients in Henan harbored HIV-1 subtype B', which is similar to the virus found in Thailand, and HCV genotypes 1b and 2a, whereas the IDU in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Xinjiang carried HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms 07 and 08, which resemble those in India, and HCV genotypes 1b, 3a, and 3b. Our findings show that the epidemics of HIV-1 and HCV infection in China are the consequences of multiple introductions. The distinct distribution patterns of both the HIV-1 and HCV genotypes in the different high-risk groups are tightly linked to the mode of transmission rather than geographic proximity. These findings provide information relevant to antiviral therapy and vaccine development in China and should assist public health workers in implementing measures to reduce the further dissemination of these viruses in the world's most populous nation.",

        "Abstract": "We analyse viral load data of five patients under ritonavir monotherapy using a model of HIV dynamics under antiretroviral therapy that includes both drug pharmacokinetics and the intracellular delay from the time of cell infection to viral production. Using this approach we separate pharamacokinetic from intracellular delays, and obtain new estimates of intracellular delay and the antiviral efficacy of ritonavir. We find the average intracellular delay to be 1 day, in agreement with experiments. The average viral generation time is now estimated at 2 days, resulting in approximately 180 replication cycles per year. The model also reveals that ritonavir monotherapy is approximately 65% as efficacious as a recently used potent four-drug therapy, suggesting that selection for drug resistance may be facilitated by the relatively low efficacy of individual drugs, contributing in part to the inherent limitations of current therapies in combating HIV-1 infection.",

        "Abstract": "The advent of potent combination antiretroviral therapy has been an important breakthrough in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, resulting in marked reductions in HIV-1-related morbidity and mortality. Antiretroviral therapy has also provided researchers with a powerful tool to perturb the equilibrium of viral production and viral clearance, allowing them to dissect the underlying dynamics that control the pathogenesis of AIDS. Here, we review our current understanding of the sources of HIV-1 production, the estimates for the virion and the host-cell half-lives, and the pathways of virion trafficking and clearance. We also discuss the obstacles that result from the ability of HIV-1 to remain dormant for a prolonged period of time in a subset of long-lived cells, despite an apparently effective antiretroviral treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Cellular turnover rates in the immune system can be determined by labelling dividing cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) or deuterated glucose ((2)H-glucose). To estimate the turnover rate from such measurements one has to fit a particular mathematical model to the data. The biological assumptions underlying various models developed for this purpose are controversial. Here, we fit a series of different models to BrdU data on CD4(+) T cells from SIV(-) and SIV(+) rhesus macaques. We first show that the parameter estimates obtained using these models depend strongly on the details of the model. To resolve this lack of generality we introduce a new parameter for each model, the 'average turnover rate', defined as the cellular death rate averaged over all subpopulations in the model. We show that very different models yield similar estimates of the average turnover rate, i.e. ca. 1% day(-1) in uninfected monkeys and ca. 2% day(-1) in SIV-infected monkeys. Thus, we show that one can use BrdU data from a possibly heterogeneous population of cells to estimate the average turnover rate of that population in a robust manner.",

        "Abstract": "We determined average cellular turnover rates by fitting mathematical models to 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine measurements in SIV-infected and uninfected rhesus macaques. The daily turnover rates of CD4(+) T cells, CD4(-) T cells, CD20(+) B cells, and CD16(+) NK cells in normal uninfected rhesus macaques were 1, 1, 2, and 2%, respectively. Daily turnover rates of CD45RA(-) memory T cells were 1%, and those of CD45RA(+) naive T cells were 0.5% for CD4(+) T cells and approximately 1% for CD4(-)CD45RA(+) T cells. In SIV-infected monkeys with high viral loads, the turnover rates of T cells were increased approximately 2-fold, and that of memory T cells approximately 3-fold. The turnover of CD4(+)CD45RA(+) naive T cells was increased 2-fold, whereas that of CD4(-)CD45RA(+) naive T cells was marginally increased. B cells and NK cells also had increased turnover in SIV-infected macaques, averaging 3 and 2.5% per day, respectively. For all cell types studied here the daily turnover rate increased with the decrease of the CD4 count that accompanied SIV infection. As a consequence, the turnover rates of CD4(+) T cells, CD4(-) T cells, B cells, and NK cells within each monkey are strongly correlated. This suggests that the cellular turnover of different lymphocyte populations is governed by a similar process which one could summarize as \"generalized immune activation.\" Because the viral load and the CD4 T cell count are negatively correlated we cannot determine which of the two plays the most important role in this generalized immune activation.",

        "Abstract": "Deuterated glucose labeling was used to measure the in vivo turnover of T lymphocytes. A realistic T cell kinetic model, with populations of resting and activated T cells, was fitted to d-glucose labeling data from healthy and HIV-1-infected individuals before and after antiretroviral treatment. Our analysis highlights why HIV-1 infection, which increases the fraction of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes that are proliferating (Ki67(+)), leads to CD4 but not CD8 depletion. We find that HIV-1 infection tends to increase the rates of death and proliferation of activated CD4(+) T cells, and to increase the rate at which resting CD4 T cells become activated, but does not increase the fraction of activated CD4(+) T cells, consistent with their preferential loss in HIV-1-infected individuals. In contrast, HIV-1 infection does not lead to an increase in proliferation or death rates of activated CD8(+) T cells, but did increase the fraction of activated CD8(+) T cells, consistent with these cells remaining in an activated state longer and undergoing more rounds of proliferation than CD4(+) T cells. Our results also explain why telomeres shorten in CD8(+) cells, but not in CD4(+) cells of HIV-1-infected patients, compared with age-matched controls.",

        "Abstract": "It has been known since 1986 that CD8 T lymphocytes from certain HIV-1-infected individuals who are immunologically stable secrete a soluble factor, termed CAF, that suppresses HIV-1 replication. However, the identity of CAF remained elusive despite an extensive search. By means of a protein-chip technology, we identified a cluster of proteins that were secreted when CD8 T cells from long-term nonprogressors with HIV-1 infection were stimulated. These proteins were identified as alpha-defensin 1, 2, and 3 on the basis of specific antibody recognition and amino acid sequencing. CAF activity was eliminated or neutralized by an antibody specific for human alpha-defensins. Synthetic and purified preparations of alpha-defensins also inhibited the replication of HIV-1 isolates in vitro. Taken together, our results indicate that alpha-defensin 1, 2, and 3 collectively account for much of the anti-HIV-1 activity of CAF that is not attributable to beta-chemokines.",

        "Abstract": "Sixteen subjects were treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy within 120 days of the onset of symptoms of newly acquired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Eleven of the 16 participated in an adjunctive therapeutic vaccine trial. After a mean of 3.2 years of treatment, they elected to discontinue therapy. Virus rebound occurred in all subjects and was followed by a spontaneous, transient although significant reduction in log plasma HIV-1 RNA level, ranging from 0.3 to 3.1 log(10) copies/mL. Despite evidence of the induction of HIV-1-specific cell-mediated immune responses, plasma viremia was not persistently suppressed to <500 copies/mL in any subject. The magnitude and dynamics of virus rebound were similar in both vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. Nevertheless, given the transient suppression of viremia observed in nearly all subjects after treatment has been discontinued, further investigations of adjunctive vaccination with optimized antiretroviral therapy in treating HIV-1 infection are warranted.",

        "Abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is characterized by extensive genetic heterogeneity. Having previously demonstrated that, in the peripheral blood, the initial viral population is more homogeneous than at subsequent stages of infection, we have extended our studies to tissue samples, allowing comparisons between viral populations in peripheral blood and tissues during both the acute and chronic stages of infection. We found that homogeneity in gp120 sequences during the acute infection phase is not just restricted to the peripheral blood but also extends to other tissue compartments. However, in chronically infected individuals, heterogeneous and distinct viral populations were found in different compartments. We therefore conclude that the dominant and homogeneous viral population observed during the acute infection phase is likely to infiltrate lymphoid tissues and form the genetic bases for subsequent diversification. It is therefore likely that the compartmentalization of viral sequences observed in chronically infected patients reflects a gradual diversification of a common dominant viral variant rather than the preferential migration of distinct viral populations to different tissue compartments at the beginning of infection.",

        "Abstract": "An R5-tropic SHIV(CHN19P4) was previously generated using a primary HIV-1 subtype-C envelope. We have further characterized this SHIV in two species of macaques. To determine whether this isolate is transmissible vaginally, female pig-tailed macaques were inoculated with 2 x 10(3) TCID50 of SHIV(CHN19P4) by the vaginal route. Animals became infected with a high peak plasma viremia (>10(7) viral copies/mL) and rapid seroconversion. The viremia was accompanied by CD4+ lymphocytopenia in the gut lamina propria lymphocyte (LPL) population. Comparable CD4+ T-cell loss was not seen in peripheral blood and colonic lymph nodes. These findings demonstrate a unique R5-tropic SHIV that can be used to study envelope-related issues in vaginal transmission of the most prevalent subtype of HIV-1. We also found that rhesus macaques intravenously inoculated with 1 x 10(3) TCID50 of SHIV(CHN19P4) became infected and showed CD4+ lymphocytopenia in the gut LPL population. Despite inactivation of the vpu gene in SHIV(CHN19P4), the virus appears to target mainly gut-associated lymphoid tissues during the initial stage of infection as has been described for SHIV(SF162P), another R5-tropic (subtype B) recombinant virus. Our data indicate that the R5-mediated CD4+ lymphocytopenia in the gut is likely independent of HIV-1 genotypes and of the function of vpu at the acute phase of viral infection.",

        "Title": "The liver is a major organ for clearing simian immunodeficiency virus in rhesus monkeys.",
        "Abstract": "Infection with human or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is characterized by the rapid turnover of both viral particles and productively infected cells. It has recently been reported that the clearance of SIV in vivo is exceedingly fast, with half-lives on the order of minutes. The underlying mechanism or site responsible for this rapid clearance, however, remains unknown. To investigate this issue, we chose to infuse infectious SIVmac239 grown from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were radioactively labeled by [(35)S]methionine and [(35)S]cysteine. This approach eliminates from the viral membrane alloantigens that may have a significant impact on viral clearance. In addition, this approach also permits identification of the sites of viral clearance by measuring the radioactive intensity, even if degradation of SIV RNA occurs in tissues. We now report that the half-life of infused SIV in blood is extremely close to estimates from a previous study, in which unlabeled SIV grown in a heterologous cell line was used. The allogeneic effect due to the presence of human antigens on the surfaces of virions may, therefore, play a minimal role in the high rate of virion clearance. Moreover, close to 30% of infused radioactivity was found in the liver and measureable amounts were detected in the lungs (5.4%), lymph nodes (3.0%), and spleen (0.4%). The detection of a significant proportion of infused virus in the liver suggests that viral clearance from circulation is mediated by a common, nonspecific mechanism, such as the phagocytic functions of the reticuloendothelial system. The rapid clearance and degradation of exogenously infused virions may pose a major obstacle for gene therapy with viral vectors, unless strategies to overcome the rapid in vivo elimination of these particles are developed.",

        "Abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects cells of the immune system and leads to depletion of CD4+ T cells, and to an increase of CD8+ T-lymphocytes. However, not much is known about the dynamics of turnover (proliferation and death) of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in HIV-infected and healthy individuals. A new experimental technique has been developed using deuterated-glucose labeling that provides information on cell turnover in vivo. However, the quantitative interpretation of the data requires the development of specific dynamic models. In this paper we derive two models, a simple one-compartment model and a more complex two-compartment model. These models allow for robust quantification of death and proliferation rates, but careful consideration of the system is necessary to understand what is being measured in each case. We demonstrate that more realistic models can account not only for differences in the turnover rates between HIV-infected and healthy individuals, but also take into consideration the elevated state of activation in HIV infection. The use of these models in the interpretation of the experimental data will increase our knowledge of T cell dynamics in the context of HIV infection.",
