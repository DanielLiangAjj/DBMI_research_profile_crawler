        "Title": "Identifying Structural Features of Nucleotide Analogues to Overcome SARS-CoV-2 Exonuclease Activity.",
        "Abstract": "With the recent global spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, there remains an urgent need to develop effective and variant-resistant oral drugs. Recently, we reported in vitro results validating the use of combination drugs targeting both the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and proofreading exonuclease (ExoN) as potential COVID-19 therapeutics. For the nucleotide analogues to be efficient SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, two properties are required: efficient incorporation by RdRp and substantial resistance to excision by ExoN. Here, we have selected and evaluated nucleotide analogues with a variety of structural features for resistance to ExoN removal when they are attached at the 3' RNA terminus. We found that dideoxynucleotides and other nucleotides lacking both 2'- and 3'-OH groups were most resistant to ExoN excision, whereas those possessing both 2'- and 3'-OH groups were efficiently removed. We also found that the 3'-OH group in the nucleotide analogues was more critical than the 2'-OH for excision by ExoN. Since the functionally important sequences in Nsp14/10 are highly conserved among all SARS-CoV-2 variants, these identified structural features of nucleotide analogues offer invaluable insights for designing effective RdRp inhibitors that can be simultaneously efficiently incorporated by the RdRp and substantially resist ExoN excision. Such newly developed RdRp terminators would be good candidates to evaluate their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and animal models, perhaps combined with additional exonuclease inhibitors to increase their overall effectiveness.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency. Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate, which are the active forms of two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA-approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two of these HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19, resulting in the largest pandemic in over a hundred years. After examining the molecular structures and activities of hepatitis C viral inhibitors and comparing hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, we previously postulated that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) might inhibit SARS-CoV-2. We subsequently demonstrated that Sofosbuvir triphosphate is incorporated by the relatively low fidelity SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), serving as an immediate polymerase reaction terminator, but not by a host-like high fidelity DNA polymerase. Other investigators have since demonstrated the ability of Sofosbuvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and brain cells; additionally, COVID-19 clinical trials with EPCLUSA and with Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir have been initiated in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader to maintain the viral genome integrity. Any effective antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp must display a certain level of resistance to this proofreading activity. We report here that Sofosbuvir terminated RNA resists removal by the exonuclease to a substantially higher extent than RNA terminated by Remdesivir, another drug being used as a COVID-19 therapeutic. These results offer a molecular basis supporting the current use of Sofosbuvir in combination with other drugs in COVID-19 clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, is responsible for the current COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2' or 3' modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses' exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues for their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and to prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (triphosphates of Carbovir, Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir; 3'-OMe-UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2'-OMe-UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2'-F-dUTP, 2'-NH",

Using the same molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate forms of three other anti-viral agents, Alovudine, AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymerase inhibitors, 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and Tenofovir diphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine, AZT and TAF, respectively) to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, where they also terminate further polymerase extension. These results offer a strong molecular basis for these nucleotide analogues to be evaluated as potential therapeutics for COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "Epigenetic information is encoded in the mammalian genome in the form of cytosines methylated at the 5 position. Cytosine methylation has multiple biological effects, but our understanding of these effects has lagged because extant methods for mapping methylation sites genome-wide have severe shortcomings. For instance, the gold standard bisulfite sequencing approach suffers from the use of harsh reaction conditions resulting in DNA cleavage and incomplete conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uracil. We report here on a new photochemical method in which a DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase can be used to covalently attach reactive functionalities which upon irradiation at ‚àº350 nm initiate photoinduced intramolecular reactions that convert modified C to T analogues. We synthesized a model compound, a cinnamyl ether-containing cytidine derivative, and demonstrated its conversion to a thymidine analogue using mild conditions and a DNA-compatible wavelength (‚àº350 nm), enabled by the use of a triplet sensitizer, thioxanthone. Transfer of a cinnamyl ether or comparable reactive functionality from an AdoMet analog to cytosine followed by the use of this photoconversion method would require only small amounts of DNA and allow complete methylation profiling on both long and short read sequencing platforms.",

        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) offers a robust platform to decipher nucleic acid sequences. Recently, we reported a single-molecule nanopore-based SBS strategy that accurately distinguishes four bases by electronically detecting and differentiating four different polymer tags attached to the 5'-phosphate of the nucleotides during their incorporation into a growing DNA strand catalyzed by DNA polymerase. Further developing this approach, we report here the use of nucleotides tagged at the terminal phosphate with oligonucleotide-based polymers to perform nanopore SBS on an Œ±-hemolysin nanopore array platform. We designed and synthesized several polymer-tagged nucleotides using tags that produce different electrical current blockade levels and verified they are active substrates for DNA polymerase. A highly processive DNA polymerase was conjugated to the nanopore, and the conjugates were complexed with primer/template DNA and inserted into lipid bilayers over individually addressable electrodes of the nanopore chip. When an incoming complementary-tagged nucleotide forms a tight ternary complex with the primer/template and polymerase, the tag enters the pore, and the current blockade level is measured. The levels displayed by the four nucleotides tagged with four different polymers captured in the nanopore in such ternary complexes were clearly distinguishable and sequence-specific, enabling continuous sequence determination during the polymerase reaction. Thus, real-time single-molecule electronic DNA sequencing data with single-base resolution were obtained. The use of these polymer-tagged nucleotides, combined with polymerase tethering to nanopores and multiplexed nanopore sensors, should lead to new high-throughput sequencing methods.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a novel single molecule nanopore-based sequencing by synthesis (Nano-SBS) strategy that can accurately distinguish four bases by detecting 4 different sized tags released from 5'-phosphate-modified nucleotides. The basic principle is as follows. As each nucleotide is incorporated into the growing DNA strand during the polymerase reaction, its tag is released and enters a nanopore in release order. This produces a unique ionic current blockade signature due to the tag's distinct chemical structure, thereby determining DNA sequence electronically at single molecule level with single base resolution. As proof of principle, we attached four different length PEG-coumarin tags to the terminal phosphate of 2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-tetraphosphate. We demonstrate efficient, accurate incorporation of the nucleotide analogs during the polymerase reaction, and excellent discrimination among the four tags based on nanopore ionic currents. This approach coupled with polymerase attached to the nanopores in an array format should yield a single-molecule electronic Nano-SBS platform.",

        "Abstract": "Characterization of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations is crucial for disease diagnosis, which requires accurate and sensitive detection methods and quantification due to mitochondrial heteroplasmy. We report here the characterization of mutations for myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers syndrome using chemically cleavable biotinylated dideoxynucleotides and a mass spectrometry (MS)-based solid phase capture (SPC) single base extension (SBE) assay. The method effectively eliminates unextended primers and primer dimers, and the presence of cleavable linkers between the base and biotin allows efficient desalting and release of the DNA products from solid phase for MS analysis. This approach is capable of high multiplexing, and the use of different length linkers for each of the purines and each of the pyrimidines permits better discrimination of the four bases by MS. Both homoplasmic and heteroplasmic genotypes were accurately determined on different mtDNA samples. The specificity of the method for mtDNA detection was validated by using mitochondrial DNA-negative cells. The sensitivity of the approach permitted detection of less than 5% mtDNA heteroplasmy levels. This indicates that the SPC-SBE approach based on chemically cleavable biotinylated dideoxynucleotides and MS enables rapid, accurate, and sensitive genotyping of mtDNA and has broad applications for genetic analysis.",

We report here the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a novel set of chemically cleavable biotinylated dideoxynucleotides, ddNTPs-N‚ÇÉ-biotin, for the DNA polymerase extension reaction and its application in DNA sequencing by mass spectrometry (MS). These nucleotide analogs have a biotin moiety attached to the 5 position of the pyrimidines (C and U) or the 7 position of the purines (A and G) via a chemically cleavable azido-based linker, with different length linker arms serving as mass tags that contribute to large mass differences among the nucleotides. We demonstrate that these modified nucleotides are efficiently incorporated by DNA polymerase, and the DNA strand bearing biotinylated nucleotides is captured by streptavidin-coated beads and efficiently released using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in aqueous solution, which is compatible with DNA and downstream procedures. We performed Sanger sequencing reactions using these nucleotides to generate DNA fragments for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Both synthetic DNA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were accurately decoded, and a read length of approximately 37 bases was achieved using these nucleotides in MS sequencing.",

Molecular beacons (MBs) and binary probes (BPs) are two very important hybridization probes that are designed based on well-established photophysical principles. These probes have shown particular applicability in a variety of studies, such as mRNA tracking, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) monitoring, and microorganism identification. Molecular beacons are hairpin oligonucleotide probes that present distinctive fluorescent signatures in the presence and absence of their target. Binary probes consist of two fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide strands that can hybridize to adjacent regions of their target and generate distinctive fluorescence signals. These probes have been extensively studied and modified for different applications by modulating their structures or using various combinations of fluorophores, excimer-forming molecules, and metal complexes. This review describes the applicability and advantages of various hybridization probes that utilize novel and creative design to enhance their target detection sensitivity and specificity.",

        "Title": "An integrated system for DNA sequencing by synthesis using novel nucleotide analogues.",
        "Abstract": "The Human Genome Project has concluded, but its successful completion has increased, rather than decreased, the need for high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies. The possibility of clinically screening a full genome for an individual's mutations offers tremendous benefits, both for pursuing personalized medicine and for uncovering the genomic contributions to diseases. The Sanger sequencing method, although enormously productive for more than 30 years, requires an electrophoretic separation step that, unfortunately, remains a key technical obstacle for achieving economically acceptable full-genome results. Alternative sequencing approaches thus focus on innovations that can reduce costs. The DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) approach has shown great promise as a new sequencing platform, with particular progress reported recently. The general fluorescent SBS approach involves (i) incorporation of nucleotide analogs bearing fluorescent reporters, (ii) identification of the incorporated nucleotide by its fluorescent emissions, and (iii) cleavage of the fluorophore, along with the reinitiation of the polymerase reaction for continuing sequence determination. In this Account, we review the construction of a DNA-immobilized chip and the development of novel nucleotide reporters for the SBS sequencing platform. Click chemistry, with its high selectivity and coupling efficiency, was explored for surface immobilization of DNA. The first generation (G-1) modified nucleotides for SBS feature a small chemical moiety capping the 3'-OH and a fluorophore tethered to the base through a chemically cleavable linker; the design ensures that the nucleotide reporters are good substrates for the polymerase. The 3'-capping moiety and the fluorophore on the DNA extension products, generated by the incorporation of the G-1 modified nucleotides, are cleaved simultaneously to reinitiate the polymerase reaction. The sequence of a DNA template immobilized on a surface via click chemistry is unambiguously identified with this chip-SBS system. The second generation (G-2) SBS system was developed based on the concept that the closer the structures of the added nucleotide and the primer are to their natural counterparts, the more faithfully the polymerase would incorporate the nucleotide. In this approach, the polymerase reaction is performed with the combination of 3'-capped nucleotide reversible terminators (NRTs) and cleavable fluorescent dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). By sacrifice of a small amount of the primers permanently terminated by ddNTPs, the majority of the primers extended by the reversible terminators are reverted to the natural ones after each sequencing cycle. We have also developed the 3'-capped nucleotide reversible terminators to solve the problem of deciphering the homopolymeric regions of the template in conventional pyrosequencing. The 3'-capping moiety on the DNA extension product temporarily terminates the polymerase reaction, which allows only one nucleotide to be incorporated during each sequencing cycle. Thus, the number of nucleotides in the homopolymeric regions are unambiguously determined using the 3'-capped NRTs. It has been established that millions of DNA templates can be immobilized on a chip surface through a variety of approaches. Therefore, the integration of these high-density DNA chips with the molecular-level SBS approaches described in this Account is expected to generate a high-throughput and accurate DNA sequencing system with wide applications in biological research and health care.",

        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) on a solid surface during polymerase reaction can decipher many sequences in parallel. We report here a DNA sequencing method that is a hybrid between the Sanger dideoxynucleotide terminating reaction and SBS. In this approach, four nucleotides, modified as reversible terminators by capping the 3'-OH with a small reversible moiety so that they are still recognized by DNA polymerase as substrates, are combined with four cleavable fluorescent dideoxynucleotides to perform SBS. The ratio of the two sets of nucleotides is adjusted as the extension cycles proceed. Sequences are determined by the unique fluorescence emission of each fluorophore on the DNA products terminated by ddNTPs. On removing the 3'-OH capping group from the DNA products generated by incorporating the 3'-O-modified dNTPs and the fluorophore from the DNA products terminated with the ddNTPs, the polymerase reaction reinitiates to continue the sequence determination. By using an azidomethyl group as a chemically reversible capping moiety in the 3'-O-modified dNTPs, and an azido-based cleavable linker to attach the fluorophores to the ddNTPs, we synthesized four 3'-O-azidomethyl-dNTPs and four ddNTP-azidolinker-fluorophores for the hybrid SBS. After sequence determination by fluorescence imaging, the 3'-O-azidomethyl group and the fluorophore attached to the DNA extension product via the azidolinker are efficiently removed by using Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in aqueous solution that is compatible with DNA. Various DNA templates, including those with homopolymer regions, were accurately sequenced with a read length of >30 bases by using this hybrid SBS method on a chip and a four-color fluorescence scanner.",

        "Abstract": "Pyrosequencing is a method used to sequence DNA by detecting the pyrophosphate (PPi) group that is generated when a nucleotide is incorporated into the growing DNA strand in polymerase reaction. However, this method has an inherent difficulty in accurately deciphering the homopolymeric regions of the DNA templates. We report here the development of a method to solve this problem by using nucleotide reversible terminators. These nucleotide analogues are modified with a reversible chemical moiety capping the 3'-OH group to temporarily terminate the polymerase reaction. In this way, only one nucleotide is incorporated into the growing DNA strand even in homopolymeric regions. After detection of the PPi for sequence determination, the 3'-OH of the primer extension products is regenerated through different deprotection methods. Using an allyl or a 2-nitrobenzyl group as the reversible moiety to cap the 3'-OH of the four nucleotides, we have synthesized two sets of 3'-O-modified nucleotides, 3'-O-allyl-dNTPs and 3'-O-(2-nitrobenzyl)-dNTPs as reversible terminators for pyrosequencing. The capping moiety on the 3'-OH of the DNA extension product is efficiently removed after PPi detection by either a chemical method or photolysis. To sequence DNA, templates containing homopolymeric regions are immobilized on Sepharose beads, and then extension-signal detection-deprotection cycles are conducted by using the nucleotide reversible terminators on the DNA beads to unambiguously decipher the sequence of DNA templates. Our results establish that this reversible-terminator-pyrosequencing approach can be potentially developed into a powerful methodology to accurately determine DNA sequences.",

        "Abstract": "We report the design, synthesis, and characterization of molecular beacons (MB) consisting of three distinct fluorophores, 6-carboxyfluorescein (Fam), N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (Tam), and Cyanine-5 (Cy5). The primary light absorber/energy donor (Fam) is located on one terminus of the MB, whereas the primary energy acceptor/secondary donor (Tam) and secondary acceptor (Cy5) are located at the other terminus of the MB. In the absence of target DNA or RNA, the MB exists in the stem-closed form. Excitation of Fam initiates an energy transfer cascade from Fam to Tam and further to Cy5 generating unique fluorescence signatures defined as the ratio of the emission from each of the three fluorophores. This energy transfer cascade was investigated in detail by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as fluorescence depolarization studies. In the presence of the complementary target DNA, the MB opened efficiently and hybridized with the target separating Fam and Tam by a large distance, so that energy transfer from Fam to Tam was blocked in the stem-open form. This opening of the MB generates a \"bar code\" fluorescence signature, which is different from the signature of the stem-closed MB. The fluorescence signature of this combinatorial fluorescence energy transfer MB can be tuned by variation of the spacer length between the individual fluorophores.",

We have found that an allyl moiety can be used successfully as a linker to tether a fluorophore to a 3'-O-allyl-modified nucleotide, forming a chemically cleavable reversible terminator, 3'-O-allyl-dGTP-allyl-Bodipy-FL-510, for application in SBS. The fluorophore and the 3'-allyl group on a DNA extension product, which is generated by incorporating 3'-O-allyl-dGTP-allyl-Bodipy-FL-510, are removed simultaneously in 30 s by Pd-catalyzed deallylation in aqueous buffer solution. The resulting DNA product is successfully used as a primer for further extension in polymerase reaction. This one-pot dual-deallylation reaction thus allows the reinitiation of the polymerase reaction and increases the SBS efficiency.",

Molecular engineering approaches to modify the building blocks of DNA by introducing functional groups for purification and detection has led to the development of high-throughput genetic analysis technologies. This review is focused on the following two DNA sequencing approaches. The first approach is based on the use of molecular affinity and mass spectrometry to perform quick and highly accurate mutation screening, heterozygote identification and insertion/deletion detection. The second approach is based on a sequencing-by-synthesis platform that has the potential for generating DNA sequencing data in a massive, parallel manner. The basic principles, fundamental challenges and methods of implementation of these exciting new technologies will be discussed.",

        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) offers an approach for potential high-throughput sequencing applications. In this method, the ability of an incoming nucleotide to act as a reversible terminator for a DNA polymerase reaction is an important requirement to unambiguously determine the identity of the incorporated nucleotide before the next nucleotide is added. A free 3'-OH group on the terminal nucleotide of the primer is necessary for the DNA polymerase to incorporate an incoming nucleotide. Therefore, if the 3'-OH group of an incoming nucleotide is capped by a chemical moiety, it will cause the polymerase reaction to terminate after the nucleotide is incorporated into the DNA strand. If the capping group is subsequently removed to generate a free 3'-OH, the polymerase reaction will reinitialize. We report here the design and synthesis of a 3'-modified photocleavable fluorescent nucleotide, 3'-O-allyl-dUTP-PC-Bodipy-FL-510 (PC-Bodipy, photocleavable 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3alpha,4alpha-diaza-s-indacene), as a reversible terminator for SBS. This nucleotide analogue contains an allyl moiety capping the 3'-OH group and a fluorophore Bodipy-FL-510 linked to the 5 position of the uracil through a photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. Here, we have shown that this nucleotide is a good substrate for a DNA polymerase. After the nucleotide was successfully incorporated into a growing DNA strand and the fluorophore was photocleaved, the allyl group was removed by using a Pd-catalyzed reaction to reinitiate the polymerase reaction, thereby establishing the feasibility of using such nucleotide analogues as reversible terminators for SBS.",

        "Abstract": "We report four-color DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) on a chip, using four photocleavable fluorescent nucleotide analogues (dGTP-PC-Bodipy-FL-510, dUTP-PC-R6G, dATP-PC-ROX, and dCTP-PC-Bodipy-650) (PC, photocleavable; Bodipy, 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3alpha,4alpha-diaza-s-indacene; ROX, 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine; R6G, 6-carboxyrhodamine-6G). Each nucleotide analogue consists of a different fluorophore attached to the 5 position of the pyrimidines and the 7 position of the purines through a photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. After verifying that these nucleotides could be successfully incorporated into a growing DNA strand in a solution-phase polymerase reaction and the fluorophore could be cleaved using laser irradiation ( approximately 355 nm) in 10 sec, we then performed an SBS reaction on a chip that contains a self-priming DNA template covalently immobilized by using 1,3-dipolar azide-alkyne cycloaddition. The DNA template was produced by PCR, using an azido-labeled primer, and the self-priming moiety was attached to the immobilized DNA template by enzymatic ligation. Each cycle of SBS consists of the incorporation of the photocleavable fluorescent nucleotide into the DNA, detection of the fluorescent signal, and photocleavage of the fluorophore. The entire process was repeated to identify 12 continuous bases in the DNA template. These results demonstrate that photocleavable fluorescent nucleotide analogues can be incorporated accurately into a growing DNA strand during a polymerase reaction in solution and on a chip. Moreover, all four fluorophores can be detected and then efficiently cleaved using near-UV irradiation, thereby allowing continuous identification of the DNA template sequence. Optimization of the steps involved in this SBS approach will further increase the read-length.",

        "Abstract": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been explored widely for DNA sequencing. Compared to gel electrophoresis based sequencing systems, mass spectrometry produces very high resolution of sequencing fragments, rapid separation on microsecond time scales, and completely eliminates compressions associated with gel-based systems. While most of the research efforts have focused on using mass spectrometers to analyze the DNA products from Sanger sequencing or enzymatic digestion reactions, the read lengths attainable are currently insufficient for large-scale de novo sequencing. The advantage of mass-spectrometry sequencing is that one can unambiguously identify frameshift mutations and heterozygous mutations making it an ideal choice for resequencing projects. In these applications, DNA sequencing fragments that are the same length but with different base compositions are generated, which are challenging to consistently distinguish in gel-based sequencing systems. In contrast, MALDI-TOF MS produces mass spectra of these DNA sequencing fragments with nearly digital resolution, allowing accurate determination of the mixed bases. For these reasons mass spectrometry based sequencing has mainly been focused on the detection of frameshift mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). More recently, assays have been developed to indirectly sequence DNA by first converting it into RNA. These assays take advantage of the increased resolution and detection ability of MALDI-TOF MS for RNA.",

        "Abstract": "A mass spectrometry (MS) based multiplex genotyping method using solid phase capturable (SPC) dideoxynucleotides and single base extension (SBE), named the SPC-SBE, has been developed for mutation detection. We report here the simultaneous genotyping of 30 potential point mutation sites in exons 5, 7, and 8 of the human p53 gene in one tube using the SPC-SBE method. The 30 mutation sites, including the most frequently mutated p53 codons, were chosen to explore the high multiplexing scope of the SPC-SBE method. Thirty primers specific to each potential mutation site were designed to yield SBE products with sufficient mass differences. This was achieved by tuning the mass of some primers using modified nucleotides. Genomic DNA was amplified by multiplex PCR to produce amplicons of the three p53 exons. The 30 primers were combined with the PCR products and biotinylated dideoxynucleotides for SBE to generate 3'-biotinylated extension DNA products. These products were then captured by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, while the unextended primers and other components in the reaction were washed away. The pure extension DNA products were subsequently released from the solid phase and analyzed with MS. We simultaneously genotyped 30 potential mutation sites in the p53 gene from Wilms' tumor, head and neck tumor, and colorectal tumor. Both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes were accurately determined with digital resolution. This is the highest level of multiplex genotyping reported thus far using MS, indicating that the approach might be applicable to screening a repertoire of genotypes in candidate genes as potential disease markers.",

        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis on a solid surface offers new paradigms to overcome limitations of electrophoresis-based sequencing methods. Here we report DNA sequencing by synthesis using photocleavable (PC) fluorescent nucleotides [dUTP-PC-4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3 alpha,4 alpha-diaza-s-indacene (Bodipy)-FL-510, dCTP-PC-Bodipy-650, and dUTP-PC-6-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX)] on a glass chip constructed by 1,3-dipolar azide-alkyne cycloaddition coupling chemistry. Each nucleotide analogue consists of a different fluorophore attached to the base through a PC 2-nitrobenzyl linker. We constructed a DNA microarray by using the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition chemistry to site-specifically attach azido-modified DNA onto an alkyne-functionalized glass chip at room temperature under aqueous conditions. After verifying that the polymerase reaction could be carried out successfully on the above-described DNA array, we then performed a sequencing reaction on the chip by using a self-primed DNA template. In the first step, we extended the primer using DNA polymerase and dUTP-PC-Bodipy-FL-510, detected the fluorescent signal from the fluorophore Bodipy-FL-510, and then cleaved the fluorophore using 340 nm UV irradiation. This process was followed by extension of the primer with dCTP-PC-Bodipy-650 and the subsequent detection of the fluorescent signal from Bodipy-650 and its photocleavage. The same procedure was also performed by using dUTP-PC-ROX. The entire process was repeated five times by using the three fluorescent nucleotides to identify 7 bases in the DNA template. These results demonstrate that the PC nucleotide analogues can be incorporated accurately into a growing DNA strand during polymerase reaction on a chip, and the fluorophore can be detected and then efficiently cleaved using near-UV irradiation, thereby allowing the continuous identification of the template sequence.",

We have previously established the feasibility of an accurate DNA sequencing method using solid-phase capturable (SPC) dideoxynucleotides and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on synthetic templates, an approach we refer to as SPC-sequencing. Here, we report the application of SPC-sequencing in characterizing frameshift mutations by using the detection of the BRCA1 gene mutations 185delAG and 5382insC as examples. In this method, Sanger DNA sequencing fragments are generated in one tube by using biotinylated dideoxynucleotides. The sequencing fragments carrying a biotin moiety at the 3' end are captured on a streptavidin-coated solid phase to eliminate excess primer, primer dimers, and false stops. Only correctly terminated DNA fragments are captured, subsequently released, and analyzed by mass spectrometry to obtain digital DNA sequencing data. This method produces distinct doublet mass peaks at each point in the mass spectrum beyond the mutation site, facilitating the accurate characterization of the mutation. We have compared SPC-sequencing with electrophoresis-based sequencing in characterizing the above BRCA1 mutations, demonstrating the significant advantage offered by SPC-sequencing for the accurate identification of frameshift mutations.",

This nucleotide analog has a biotin moiety attached to the 5-position of 2'-deoxyribouridine 5'-triphosphate via a photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. We have demonstrated that dUTP-PC-Biotin can be faithfully incorporated by the DNA polymerase Thermo Sequenase into the growing DNA strand in a DNA polymerase extension reaction and that its incorporation does not hinder the addition of the subsequent nucleotide. Therefore, the DNA extension fragments generated by using the dUTP-PC-Biotin can be efficiently isolated by a streptavidin-coated surface and recovered by near-UV light irradiation at room temperature in mild condition for further analysis without using any chemicals or heat. Single and multiple primer extension reactions were performed using the dUTP-PC-Biotin to generate DNA products for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Such nucleotide analogs that carry a biotin and a photocleavable linker will allow the isolation and purification of DNA products under mild conditions for MS-based genetic analysis by DNA sequencing or multiplex single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection. Furthermore, these nucleotide analogs should also be useful in isolating DNA-protein complexes under non-denaturing conditions.",

        "Abstract": "We report the site-specific fluorescent labeling of DNA using Staudinger ligation with high efficiency and high selectivity. An oligonucleotide modified at its 5' end by an azido group was selectively reacted with 5-[(N-(3'-diphenylphosphinyl-4'-methoxycarbonyl)phenylcarbonyl)aminoacetamido]fluorescein (Fam) under aqueous conditions to produce a Fam-labeled oligonucleotide with a high yield (approximately 90%). The fluorescent oligonucleotide was characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Because of the relatively high yield of the Staudinger ligation, simple purification of the product by size-exclusion chromatography and desalting is sufficient for the resulting fluorescent oligonucleotide to be used as a primer in a Sanger dideoxy sequencing reaction to produce fluorescent DNA extension fragments, which are analyzed by a fluorescent electrophoresis DNA sequencer. The results indicate that the Staudinger ligation can be used successfully and site-specifically to prepare fluorescent oligonucleotides to produce DNA sequencing products, which are detected with single base resolution in a capillary electrophoresis DNA sequencer using laser-induced fluorescence detection.",

        "Title": "Multiplex genotyping of the human beta2-adrenergic receptor gene using solid-phase capturable dideoxynucleotides and mass spectrometry.",
        "Abstract": "Previously, we established the feasibility of using solid phase capturable (SPC) dideoxynucleotides to generate single base extension (SBE) products which were detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for multiplex genotyping, an approach that we refer to as SPC-SBE. We report here the expanding of the SPC-SBE method as a single-tube assay to simultaneously detect 20 single nucleotide variations in a model system and 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) gene. Twenty primers were designed to have a sufficient mass difference between all extension products for accurate detection of nucleotide variants of the synthetic templates related to the p53 gene. These primers were extended simultaneously in a single tube with biotin-ddNTPs to generate 3(')-biotinylated DNA products, which were first captured by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and then released from the beads and analyzed with MALDI-TOF MS. This approach generates a mass spectrum free of primer peaks and their associated dimers, increasing the scope of multiplexing SNPs. We also simultaneously genotyped 3 SNPs in the beta2AR gene (5(')LC-Cys19Arg, Gly16Arg, and Gln27Glu) from the genomic DNA of 20 individuals. Comparison of this approach with direct sequencing and the restriction fragment length polymorphism method indicated that the SPC-SBE method is superior for detecting nucleotide variations at known SNP sites.",

        "Abstract": "Three single-stranded DNA molecules of different lengths were synthesized and characterized, each containing a fluorescent dye (6-carboxyfluorescein) connected to the 5' end via a photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker and a biotin moiety at the 3' end. UV irradiation (lambda approximately 340 nm) of solutions containing these fluorescent DNA molecules caused the complete cleavage of the nitrobenzyl linker, separating the fluorophore from the DNA. The photocleavage products were characterized by HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Our experimental results indicated that the proximity of the chromophore 6-carboxyfluorescein to the 2-nitrobenzyl linker did not hinder the quantitative photocleavage of the linker in the DNA molecules. The biotin moiety allowed immobilization of the fluorescent DNA on streptavidin-coated glass chips. The photocleavage of the immobilized DNA was investigated directly by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that close to 80% of the fluorophore was removed from the immobilized DNA after UV irradiation at 340 nm. These results strongly support the application of the 2-nitrobenzyl moiety as an efficient photocleavable linker, connecting fluorescent probes to DNA molecules for a variety of biological analyses such as DNA sequencing by synthesis.",

        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis during a polymerase reaction using laser-induced fluorescence detection is an approach that has a great potential to increase the throughput and data quality of DNA sequencing. We report the design and synthesis of a photocleavable fluorescent nucleoside triphosphate, one of the essential molecules required for the sequencing-by-synthesis approach. We synthesized this nucleoside triphosphate by attaching a fluorophore, 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3alpha,4alpha-diaza-s-indacene propionic acid (BODIPY), to the 5 position of 2'-deoxyuridine triphosphate via a photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. We demonstrate that the nucleotide analogue can be faithfully incorporated by a DNA polymerase Thermo Sequenase into the growing DNA strand in a DNA-sequencing reaction and that its incorporation does not hinder the addition of the subsequent nucleotide. These results indicate that the nucleotide analogue is an excellent substrate for Thermo Sequenase. We also systematically studied the photocleavage of the fluorescent dye from a DNA molecule that contained the nucleotide analogue. UV irradiation at 340 nm of the DNA molecule led to the efficient release of the fluorescent dye, ensuring that a previous fluorescence signal did not leave any residue that could interfere with the detection of the next nucleotide. Thus, our results indicate that it should be feasible to use four different fluorescent dyes with distinct fluorescence emissions as unique tags to label the four nucleotides (A, C, G, and T) through the photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. These fluorescent tags can be removed easily by photocleavage after the identification of each nucleotide in the DNA sequencing-by-synthesis approach.",

        "Abstract": "We report an approach using solid phase capturable biotinylated dideoxynucleotides (biotin-ddNTPs) in single base extension for multiplex genotyping by mass spectrometry (MS). In this method, oligonucleotide primers that have different molecular weights and that are specific to the polymorphic sites in the DNA template are extended with biotin-ddNTPs by DNA polymerase to generate 3'-biotinylated DNA products. These products are then captured by streptavidin-coated solid phase magnetic beads, while the unextended primers and other components in the reaction are washed away. The pure extension DNA products are subsequently released from the solid phase and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS. The mass of the extension products is determined using a stable oligonucleotide as a common internal mass standard. Since only the pure extension DNA products are introduced to the MS for analysis, the resulting mass spectrum is free of non-extended primer peaks and their associated dimers, which increases the accuracy and scope of multiplexing in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. The solid phase purification approach also facilitates desalting of the captured oligonucleotides, which is essential for accurate mass measurement by MS. We selected four biotin-ddNTPs with distinct molecular weights to generate extension products that have a 2-fold increase in mass difference compared to that with conventional ddNTPs. This increase in mass difference provides improved resolution and accuracy in detecting heterozygotes in the mass spectrum. Using this method, we simultaneously distinguished six nucleotide variations on synthetic DNA templates mimicking mutations in the p53 gene and two disease-associated SNPs in the human hereditary hemochromatosis gene.",

        "Abstract": "Combinatorial fluorescence energy transfer (CFET) tags, constructed by exploiting energy transfer and combinatorial synthesis, allow multiple biological targets to be analyzed simultaneously. We here describe a multiplex single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay based on single base extension (SBE) using CFET tags and biotinylated dideoxynucleotides (biotin-ddNTPs). A library of CFET-labeled oligonucleotide primers was mixed with biotin-ddNTPs, DNA polymerase and the DNA templates containing the SNPs in a single tube. The nucleotide at the 3'-end of each CFET-labeled oligonucleotide primer was complementary to a particular SNP in the template. Only the CFET-labeled primer that is fully complementary to the DNA template was extended by DNA polymerase with a biotin-ddNTP. We isolated the DNA extension fragments that carry a biotin at the 3'-end by capture with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, while the unextended primers were eliminated. The biotinylated fluorescent DNA fragments were subsequently analyzed in a multicolor fluorescence electrophoresis system. The distinct fluorescence signature and electrophoretic mobility of each DNA extension product in the electropherogram coded the SNPs without the use of a sizing standard. We simultaneously distinguished six nucleotide variations in synthetic DNA templates and a PCR product from the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene. The use of CFET-labeled primers and biotin-ddNTPs coupled with the specificity of DNA polymerase in SBE offered a multiplex method for detecting SNPs.",
