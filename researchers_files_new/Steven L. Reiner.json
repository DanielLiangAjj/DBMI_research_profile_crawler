        "Abstract": "Treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) often fails to elicit durable antitumor immunity. Recent studies suggest that ICB does not restore potency to terminally dysfunctional T cells, but instead drives proliferation and differentiation of self-renewing progenitor T cells into fresh, effector-like T cells. Antitumor immunity catalyzed by ICB is characterized by mobilization of antitumor T cells in systemic circulation and tumor. To address whether abundance of self-renewing T cells in blood is associated with immunotherapy response, we used flow cytometry of peripheral blood from a cohort of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ICB. At baseline, expression of T-cell factor 1 (TCF1), a marker of self-renewing T cells, was detected at higher frequency in effector-memory (CCR7-) CD8+ T cells from patients who experienced durable clinical benefit compared to those with primary resistance to ICB. On-treatment blood samples from patients benefiting from ICB also exhibited a greater frequency of TCF1+CCR7-CD8+ T cells and higher proportions of TCF1 expression in treatment-expanded PD-1+CCR7-CD8+ T cells. The observed correlation of TCF1 frequency in CCR7-CD8+ T cells and response to ICB suggests that broader examination of self-renewing T-cell abundance in blood will determine its potential as a noninvasive, predictive biomarker of response and resistance to immunotherapy.",

GC is an important area of focus of the medical community, given its often late-stage of diagnosis and associated high mortality rate. While surgery and chemotherapy remain the primary treatments, attention has been drawn to the use of immunologic therapies, which have shown promise in the treatment of other malignancies. The role for immune-based therapies has become clearer as we obtain a greater understanding of the role of the immune system in gastric cancer formation and growth. A variety treatment to augment the immune system are under evaluation in clinical trials, and these include immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, and immune cell-based therapies. Here, we review the immune landscape and immune-based therapies for GC.",

For many regenerating tissues and cellular systems, such as epithelia and blood, there are at least three distinguishable stages of development and repair, marked by progressive loss of self-renewal and progressive commitment to differentiation. T cells seem to be no different. Quiescent precursors become activated and yield anabolic, proliferative progenitors while self-renewing the quiescent precursor population. Activated progenitors then yield differentiated cellular descendants alongside the self-renewal of progenitors. Nomenclature reflecting the mutually opposing nature of T-cell self-renewal and T-cell differentiation would help synchronize phenomena such as T-cell memory, protective immunity, and T-cell exhaustion with other regenerative paradigms, as well as offer new strategies to influence the intensity and duration of immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Growth signals drive hematopoietic progenitor cells to proliferate and branch into divergent cell fates, but how unequal outcomes arise from a common progenitor is not fully understood. We used steady-state analysis of in vivo hematopoiesis and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L)-induced in vitro differentiation of dendritic cells (DCs) to determine how growth signals regulate lineage bias. We found that Flt3L signaling induced anabolic activation and proliferation of DC progenitors, which was associated with DC differentiation. Perturbation of processes associated with quiescence and catabolism, including AMP-activated protein kinase signaling, fatty acid oxidation, or mitochondrial clearance increased development of cDC2 cells at the expense of cDC1 cells. Conversely, scavenging anabolism-associated reactive oxygen species skewed differentiation toward cDC1 cells. Sibling daughter cells of dividing DC progenitors exhibited unequal expression of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8, which correlated with clonal divergence in FoxO3a signaling and population-level bifurcation of cell fate. We propose that unequal transmission of growth signals during cell division might support fate branches during proliferative expansion of progenitors.",

Divergent cellular anabolism versus catabolism is emerging as a feature of several developmental and regenerative paradigms. Metabolism can dictate cell fate, in part, because lineage-specific regulators are embedded in the circuitry of conserved metabolic switches. Unequal transmission of PI3K signaling during regenerative divisions is reminiscent of compartmentalized PI3K activity during directed motility or polarized information flow in non-dividing cells. The diverse roles of PI3K pathways in membrane traffic, cell polarity, metabolism, and gene expression may have converged to instruct sibling cell feast and famine, thereby enabling clonal differentiation alongside self-renewal.",

        "Abstract": "Regeneration requires related cells to diverge in fate. We show that activated lymphocytes yield sibling cells with unequal elimination of aged mitochondria. Disparate mitochondrial clearance impacts cell fate and reflects larger constellations of opposing metabolic states. Differentiation driven by an anabolic constellation of PI3K/mTOR activation, aerobic glycolysis, inhibited autophagy, mitochondrial stasis, and ROS production is balanced with self-renewal maintained by a catabolic constellation of AMPK activation, mitochondrial elimination, oxidative metabolism, and maintenance of FoxO1 activity. Perturbations up and down the metabolic pathways shift the balance of nutritive constellations and cell fate owing to self-reinforcement and reciprocal inhibition between anabolism and catabolism. Cell fate and metabolic state are linked by transcriptional regulators, such as IRF4 and FoxO1, with dual roles in lineage and metabolic choice. Instructing some cells to utilize nutrients for anabolism and differentiation while other cells catabolically self-digest and self-renew may enable growth and repair in metazoa.",

        "Abstract": "Type 1 innate lymphocytes comprise two developmentally divergent lineages, type 1 helper innate lymphoid cells (hILC1s) and conventional NK cells (cNKs). All type 1 innate lymphocytes (ILCs) express the transcription factor T-bet, but cNKs additionally express Eomesodermin (Eomes). We show that deletion of Eomes alleles at the onset of type 1 ILC maturation using NKp46-Cre imposes a substantial block in cNK development. Formation of the entire lymphoid and nonlymphoid type 1 ILC compartment appears to require the semiredundant action of both T-bet and Eomes. To determine if Eomes is sufficient to redirect hILC1 development to a cNK fate, we generated transgenic mice that express Eomes when and where T-bet is expressed using Tbx21 locus control to drive expression of Eomes codons. Ectopic Eomes induces cNK-like properties across the lymphoid and nonlymphoid type 1 ILC compartments. Subsequent to their divergent lineage specification, hILC1s and cNKs thus possess substantial developmental plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "Metazoan sibling cells often diverge in activity and identity, suggesting links between growth signals and cell fate. We show that unequal transduction of nutrient-sensitive PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling during cell division bifurcates transcriptional networks and fates of kindred cells. A sibling B lymphocyte with stronger signaling, indexed by FoxO1 inactivation and IRF4 induction, undergoes PI3K-driven Pax5 repression and plasma cell determination, while its sibling with weaker PI3K activity renews a memory or germinal center B cell fate. PI3K-driven effector T cell determination silences TCF1 in one sibling cell, while its PI3K-attenuated sibling self-renews in tandem. Prior to bifurcations achieving irreversible plasma or effector cell fate determination, asymmetric signaling during initial divisions specifies a more proliferative, differentiation-prone lymphocyte in tandem with a more quiescent memory cell sibling. By triggering cell division but transmitting unequal intensity between sibling cells, nutrient-sensitive signaling may be a frequent arbiter of cell fate bifurcations during development and repair.",

However, their function must often occur in more than one way, in more than one place and at more than one time. Experimental evidence supports the view that a single activated lymphocyte can produce a variety of cellular descendants. The mechanisms that are responsible for generating diversity among the progeny of a single lymphocyte remain a subject of lively controversy. Some groups have suggested stochastic mechanisms that are analogous to the diversification of the antigen receptor repertoire. We suggest that the complexity of lymphocyte fates in space and time can be derived from a single naive lymphocyte using the principles of cell diversification that are common in developmental and regenerative biology, including (but not limited to) asymmetric cell division.",

We tested the consequence of conditional deletion of the bone marrow homing receptor CXCR4 on antiviral T cell responses. CXCR4-deficient CD8(+) T cells have impaired memory cell maintenance due to defective homeostatic proliferation. Upon rechallenge, however, CXCR4-deficient T cells can re-expand and renew the CM pool while producing secondary effector cells. The critical bone marrow-derived signals essential for CD8(+) T cell homeostatic self-renewal appear to be dispensable to yield self-renewing, functionally asymmetric cell fates during rechallenge.",

Identification and separation of cells with differential Eomes expression would allow for better understanding of the transcriptional program governing these cytotoxic lymphocytes. Here, we report the use of an Eomes(gfp)-targeted mouse allele that displays robust fidelity to Eomes protein expression in NK and T cells. Use of this reporter mouse revealed that Eomes expression in antiviral effector cells did not correlate with enhanced cytotoxicity but rather was associated with more efficient central memory differentiation. Weakening of reporter activity in Eomes-deficient CD8(+) T cells revealed a critical role for Eomes protein in maintaining central memory cells that have activated the Eomes locus. Characterization of reporter activity in NK lineage cells also permitted identification of a novel intermediate of NK cell maturation. Thus, the murine Eomes(gfp)-targeted allele provides a novel opportunity to explore Eomes biology in cytotoxic lymphocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Clonal selection of a T cell for use in the immune response appears to necessitate proliferative expansion and terminal effector differentiation of some cellular progeny, while reserving other progeny as less-differentiated memory cells. It has been suggested that asymmetric cell division may promote initial cell diversification. Stem cell-like models of adaptive immunity might predict that subsequent encounters with a pathogen would evoke reiterative, self-renewing, asymmetric division by memory T cells. In this study, we show that murine memory CD8(+) T cells can divide asymmetrically in response to secondary encounter with pathogen. Critical regulators of signaling and transcription are partitioned to one side of the mitotic spindle in rechallenged memory T cells, and two phenotypically distinct populations of daughter cells are evident from the earliest divisions. Memory T cells may thus use asymmetric cell division to generate cellular heterogeneity when faced with pathogen rechallenge.",

        "Abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells play critical roles defending against tumors and pathogens. We show that mice lacking both transcription factors Eomesodermin (Eomes) and T-bet failed to develop NK cells. Developmental stability of immature NK cells constitutively expressing the death ligand TRAIL depended on T-bet. Conversely, maturation characterized by loss of constitutive TRAIL expression and induction of Ly49 receptor diversity and integrin CD49b (DX5(+)) required Eomes. Mature NK cells from which Eomes was deleted reverted to phenotypic immaturity if T-bet was present or downregulated NK lineage antigens if T-bet was absent, despite retaining expression of Ly49 receptors. Fetal and adult hepatic hematopoiesis restricted Eomes expression and limited NK development to the T-bet-dependent, immature stage, whereas medullary hematopoiesis permitted Eomes-dependent NK maturation in adult mice. These findings reveal two sequential, genetically separable checkpoints of NK cell maturation, the progression of which is metered largely by the anatomic localization of hematopoiesis.",

        "Abstract": "Lifelong antibody responses to vaccination require reorganization of lymphoid tissue and dynamic intercellular communication called the germinal center reaction. B lymphocytes undergo cellular polarization during antigen stimulation, acquisition, and presentation, which are critical steps for initiating humoral immunity. Here, we show that germinal center B lymphocytes asymmetrically segregate the transcriptional regulator Bcl6, the receptor for interleukin-21, and the ancestral polarity protein atypical protein kinase C to one side of the plane of division, generating unequal inheritance of fate-altering molecules by daughter cells. Germinal center B lymphocytes from mice with a defect in leukocyte adhesion fail to divide asymmetrically. These results suggest that motile cells lacking constitutive attachment can receive provisional polarity cues from the microenvironment to generate daughter cell diversity and self-renewal.",

        "Abstract": "Polarized segregation of proteins in T cells is thought to play a role in diverse cellular functions including signal transduction, migration, and directed secretion of cytokines. Persistence of this polarization can result in asymmetric segregation of fate-determining proteins during cell division, which may enable a T cell to generate diverse progeny. Here, we provide evidence that a lineage-determining transcription factor, T-bet, underwent asymmetric organization in activated T cells preparing to divide and that it was unequally partitioned into the two daughter cells. This unequal acquisition of T-bet appeared to result from its asymmetric destruction during mitosis by virtue of concomitant asymmetric segregation of the proteasome. These results suggest a mechanism by which a cell may unequally localize cellular activities during division, thereby imparting disparity in the abundance of cell fate regulators in the daughter cells.",

        "Abstract": "A hallmark of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), caused by mutation of the Fas death receptor, is massive lymphadenopathy from aberrant expansion of CD4(-)CD8(-) (double-negative [DN]) T cells. Eomesodermin (Eomes) is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors and plays critical roles in effector cell function and memory cell fitness of CD8(+) T lymphocytes. We provide evidence in this study that DN T cells exhibit dysregulated expression of Eomes in humans and mice with ALPS. We also find that T cell-specific deletion of Eomes prevents lymphoid hypertrophy and accumulation of DN T cells in Fas-mutant mice. Although Eomes has critical physiological roles in the function and homeostasis of CD8(+) T cells, overexpression of Eomes appears to enable pathological induction or expansion of unusual CD8-related T cell subsets. Thus, antagonism of Eomes emerges as a therapeutic target for DN T cell ablation in ALPS.",

T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes) are key transcription factors of cytotoxic lymphocyte lineages. We show in this study that CD8(+) T cells lacking Eomes compete poorly in contributing to the pool of Ag-specific central memory cells. Eomes-deficient CD8(+) T cells undergo primary clonal expansion but are defective in long-term survival, populating the bone marrow niche and re-expanding postrechallenge. The phenotype of Eomes-deficient CD8(+) T cells supports the hypothesis that T-bet and Eomes can act redundantly to induce effector functions, but can also act to reciprocally promote terminal differentiation versus self-renewal of Ag-specific memory cells.",

CD4+ T cells lacking miR-155, for example, exhibit bias towards Th2 differentiation, indicating that the absence of individual miR could alter CD4+ T-cell differentiation. We now show that miR-155 is induced upon T-cell activation and that it promotes Th1 differentiation when over-expressed in activated CD4+ T cells. Antagonism of miR-155 leads to induction of IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain (IFN-gammaRalpha), and a functional miR-155 target site is identified within the 3' untranslated region of IFN-gammaRalpha. These results identify IFN-gammaRalpha as a second miR-155 target in T cells and suggest that miR-155 contributes to Th1 differentiation in CD4+ T cells by inhibiting IFN-gamma signaling.",

How memory T cells develop and the relationship between effector and memory T cells has been actively debated in the literature for many years and several models have been proposed to explain the divergent developmental fates of T cell progeny. Here, Nature Reviews Immunology asks four leading researchers in the field to provide their thoughts and opinions on the ontogeny of memory T cells and its implications for vaccine design.",

        "Abstract": "A naïve T cell recruited into an immune response receives its critical inductive signals in the lymph node. The selected T cell must then produce cellular progeny empowered with new functions. Differentiated effector cells divide and migrate to infected tissues with an imprint of the instructions delivered to their progenitor. Some progeny of a selected naïve T cell, however, must remain undifferentiated and persist as lymph node-dwelling memory cells to replace and fortify defense should the intruder return. The integration of cell division, differentiation, diversification, and four-dimensional navigation make the clonal burst of a T cell in reaction to microbial invasion an exciting problem of developmental biology, cellular adaptation to environmental cues, and the propagation of signaling pathways through space and time. Epigenetic control of gene expression and an ancient cellular diversification mechanism called asymmetric cell division have recently been proposed to explain how a selected T cell can accomplish its imposing tasks. Future investigations will be directed toward understanding the mechanisms that allow a selected T cell to produce daughter T cells that are different, that are capable of remembering their inductive history, and that fulfill the demand for acute function and regeneration.",

We show that CD8+ T cells deficient in the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes) fail to differentiate into functional killers required for defense against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Instead, virus-specific CD8+ T cells lacking both T-bet and Eomes differentiate into an interleukin-17-secreting lineage, reminiscent of the helper T cell fate that has been implicated in autoimmunity and extracellular microbial defense. Upon viral infection, mice with T cells lacking both T-bet and Eomes develop a CD8+ T cell-dependent, progressive inflammatory and wasting syndrome characterized by multi-organ infiltration of neutrophils. T-bet and Eomes, thus, ensure that CD8+ T cells adopt an appropriate course of intracellular rather than extracellular destruction.",

We now show that T-bet represses transcription of IL-7Ralpha and drives differentiation of effector and effector-memory CD8+ T cells at the expense of central-memory cells. We also found T-bet to be overexpressed in CD8+ T cells that differentiated in the absence of CD4+ T cell help, a condition that is associated with defective central-memory formation. Finally, deletion of T-bet corrected the abnormal phenotypic and functional properties of \"unhelped\" memory CD8+ T cells. T-bet, thus, appears to function as a molecular switch between central- and effector-memory cell differentiation. Antagonism of T-bet may, therefore, represent a novel strategy to offset dysfunctional programming of memory CD8+ T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Autoimmunity is thought to reflect an imbalance between regulatory T helper lymphocytes (Treg) and pathogenic, IL-17-secreting T helper (Th17) cells. Induction of both adaptive Treg and Th17 cells requires signalling from TGF-beta. We now show that, in the context of TGF-beta signalling, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) leads to increased induction of CD4(+) T cells expressing the Treg specification factor forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3) and decreased frequency of cells expressing IL-17, even in the presence of IL-6. Using a specific agonist and antagonist, as well as retroviral over-expression, we also provide evidence that the effects of ATRA are likely to be at least partially mediated by the nuclear retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha). These findings indicate that signalling through a specific nuclear retinoic acid receptor can favour the decision to adopt the Treg fate at the expense of Th17 fate. Specific agonists of RARalpha could, therefore, be considered candidates for the treatment of autoimmunity.",

        "Abstract": "In the course of the immune response against microbes, naïve T cells proliferate and generate varied classes of effector cells, as well as memory cells with distinct properties and functions. Owing to recent technological advances, some of the most imposing questions regarding effector and memory T cell differentiation are now becoming experimentally soluble: How many classes of antigen-specific T cells exist, and how malleable are they in their fate and in their functional state? How might a spectrum of cell fates be imparted to the clonal descendants of a single lymphocyte? Where, when, and how does pathogen-associated information refine the instruction, selection, and direction of newly activated T cells as they perform their tasks in different locations and times? Some surprising new glimpses ahead on these subjects and other yet-unanswered questions are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "A hallmark of mammalian immunity is the heterogeneity of cell fate that exists among pathogen-experienced lymphocytes. We show that a dividing T lymphocyte initially responding to a microbe exhibits unequal partitioning of proteins that mediate signaling, cell fate specification, and asymmetric cell division. Asymmetric segregation of determinants appears to be coordinated by prolonged interaction between the T cell and its antigen-presenting cell before division. Additionally, the first two daughter T cells displayed phenotypic and functional indicators of being differentially fated toward effector and memory lineages. These results suggest a mechanism by which a single lymphocyte can apportion diverse cell fates necessary for adaptive immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Cytokines are critical determinants for specification of lineage-defining transcription factors of CD4+ T cell subsets. Little is known, however, about how cytokines regulate expression of T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes) in effector and memory CD8+ T cells. We now report that IL-12, a signature of cell-mediated immunity, represses Eomes while positively regulating T-bet in effector CD8+ T cells during infection with Listeria monocytogenes. After resolution of infection and abatement of IL-12 signaling, Eomes expression rises whereas T-bet expression declines in memory CD8+ T cells. Eomes becomes derepressed in effector cells by ablation of IL-12 signaling. In the absence of IL-12, the dynamics of clonal expansion and contraction are also perturbed. Together, these results reveal how a pathogen-associated signal, such as IL-12, could act as a switch, regulating appropriate clonal growth and decline while, in parallel, shaping a unique pattern of fate-determining transcription factors.",

        "Abstract": "Exposure of naive Th cell precursors (Thp) to IL-21 inhibits IFN-gamma production from developing Th1 cells. The inhibition of IFN-gamma seen in IL-21-treated Thp cells is specific as the expression of other Th1 cytokines is unaffected. Recently, it has been reported that Eomesodermin (Eomes), a member of the T-box gene family, is expressed in developing CD8+ T cells and plays an important role in regulating IFN-gamma production and cytolytic effector function. In this study, we show that Eomes mRNA and protein are also expressed in developing Th1 cells, and exposure of naive Thp cells to IL-21 results in a decrease in Eomes expression. Moreover, the repression of Eomes expression by IL-21 is not due to an indirect effect of IL-21 on the expression of IFN-gamma or STAT4 and is independent of STAT1 and T-bet expression. Finally, we show that ectopic expression of Eomes prevents the inhibition of IFN-gamma production from IL-21-treated Thp cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Eomes plays a role in regulating IFN-gamma production in CD4+ T cells and IL-21 inhibits IFN-gamma production in developing Th1 cells through the repression of Eomes expression.",

        "Abstract": "We are often taught that secondary, or memory, responses by lymphocytes are more vigorous than primary responses. An expectation commonly associated with this notion is that the initial encounter with a pathogen should result in immunity to re-infection. Although this outcome is sometimes the case, it is not universally true. In this review, we propose a unified model of T-cell memory to explain the apparent successes and failures of eliciting vaccine-like protection from prior encounters with pathogens. We speculate that memory T cells arise as an invariant consequence of clonal selection during an immune response. The quality of memory T cells, however, seems to vary in the degree to which they have acquired effector characteristics and, thus, their ability to confer immunity to re-infection. Although not all memory T cells possess the embellished attributes of fully developed effector cells, they all seem to share the rudimentary quality of preserving an antigen specificity that has proven itself useful. We suggest that the ability to maintain the integrity of the T-cell repertoire, more than establishing immunity to re-infection, may represent the fundamental form of memory for the adaptive immune system.",

        "Abstract": "One mechanism to control immune responses following infection is to rapidly down-regulate Ag presentation, which has been observed in acute viral and bacterial infections. In this study, we describe experiments designed to address whether Ag presentation is decreased after an initial response to Leishmania major. Naive alphabeta-Leishmania-specific (ABLE) TCR transgenic T cells were adoptively transferred into mice at various times after L. major infection to determine the duration of presentation of parasite-derived Ags. ABLE T cells responded vigorously at the initiation of infection, but the ability to prime these cells quickly diminished, independent of IL-10, regulatory T cells, or Ag load. However, Ag-experienced clonal and polyclonal T cell populations could respond, indicating that the diminution in naive ABLE cell responses was not due to lack of Ag presentation. Because naive T cell priming could be restored by removal of the endogenous T cell population, or adoptive transfer of Ag-pulsed dendritic cells, it appears that T cells that have previously encountered Ag during infection compete with naive Ag-specific T cells. These results suggest that during L. major infection Ag-experienced T cells, rather than naive T cells, may be primarily responsible for sustaining the immune response.",

Memory CD8(+) T cells and natural killer cells share cytotoxic potential and dependence on the growth factor interleukin 15. We now show that mice with compound mutations of the genes encoding the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin were nearly devoid of several lineages dependent on interleukin 15, including memory CD8(+) T cells and mature natural killer cells, and that their cells had defective cytotoxic effector programming. Moreover, T-bet and eomesodermin were responsible for inducing enhanced expression of CD122, the receptor specifying interleukin 15 responsiveness. Therefore, these key transcription factors link the long-term renewal of memory CD8(+) T cells to their characteristic effector potency.",

        "Abstract": "The stability of helper T cell fates is not well understood. Using conditional introduction of dominant-negative factors, we now show that T-bet and GATA-3 are far more critical in establishment than maintenance of IFN-gamma and IL-4 activity during Th1 and Th2 maturation, respectively. We also show that a genetic interaction between T-bet and its target Hlx seems to be required for Th1 maturation, but that Hlx may also be dispensable for maintenance of a transcriptionally permissive ifng gene. In parallel to progressive activator independence in the permissive lineage, the ifng gene becomes more recalcitrant to switching as the forbidden lineage matures. T-bet plus Hlx can disrupt ifng silencing when introduced into developing Th2 cells, but they fail to perturb ifng silencing in mature Th2 cells. In contrast, a hypermorphic allele of T-bet can reverse silencing of the ifng gene in mature Th2 cells. These results suggest that signature gene activity of helper T cells is initially plastic but later becomes epigenetically fixed and offer an initial strategy for inducing mature cells to switch their fate.",

        "Abstract": "Immunity often depends on proper cell fate choice by helper T lymphocytes. A naive cell, with minimal expression of IFN-gamma and IL-4, must give rise to progeny expressing high levels of either one, but not both, of those cytokines to defend against protozoan and helminthic pathogens, respectively. In the present study, we show that inactivation of the Mbd2 gene, which links DNA methylation and repressed chromatin, results in enhanced resistance to the protozoan parasite Leishmania major but impaired immunity to the intestinal helminth Trichuris muris. Helper T cells from methyl CpG-binding domain protein-2-deficient mice exhibit exuberant patterns of cytokine expression despite appropriate silencing of genes encoding the lineage-specifying factors T-bet and GATA-3. These results suggest that gene silencing can facilitate the ability of a progenitor cell to give rise to appropriately differentiated daughter cells in vivo. These findings also point to novel pathways that could participate in genetic control of resistance to infection and autoimmunity.",

        "Abstract": "Helper T cells engaged in an immune response confront a prevalent challenge for developmentally regulated gene expression: How does a cell give rise to daughter cells with different fates? Additionally, lymphocyte function is intimately associated with the processes of cell division and migration. This imposes an additional burden for daughter cells, to remember inductive events from which they are temporally and spatially removed. An emerging view is that helper T cells use epigenetic mechanisms tied to the structure of chromatin and its covalent modifications to achieve at least two important features of their programmed gene expression. Epigenetic effects organize the ability of signal transduction pathways to generate a restricted set of progeny from a multi-potent progenitor. In addition, epigenetic effects seem to allow dividing cells to memorize, or imprint, signaling events that occurred earlier in their development. Beyond helper T cells, the use of epigenetic effects is emerging as a common strategy in development and function of the mammalian immune system, suggesting that epigenetic effects may play a more prominent role in metazoan cell differentiation than previously appreciated. Lymphocytes are, thus, becoming a tractable system for genetic and biochemical dissection of the ways in which the genome is embedded with regulatory information to achieve developmental complexity.",

        "Abstract": "To address how heritable patterns of gene expression are acquired during the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells, we analyzed the nuclear position of lineage-restricted cytokine genes and their upstream regulators by 3-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization. During Th1 differentiation, GATA-3 and c-maf loci, which encode upstream regulators of Th2 cytokines, were progressively repositioned to centromeric heterochromatin as defined by a gamma-satellite repeat probe and/or the nuclear periphery, compartments that have been associated with transcriptional repression. A third transcription factor locus, T-bet, which controls Th1-specific programs, was subject to de novo CpG methylation in a Th2 cell clone. In contrast, we did not find repositioning of the cytokine gene loci IL-2, IL-3, IL-4 or IFN-gamma during T helper cell differentiation. Instead, IFN-gamma was constitutively associated with the nuclear periphery, even when primed for expression in Th1 cells. Our results suggest that Th1/Th2 lineage commitment and differentiation involve repositioning of the regulators of cytokine expression, rather than the cytokine genes themselves.",

        "Abstract": "The production of IFN-gamma by T cells and the ability of this cytokine to activate the transcription factor STAT1 are implicated in the activation of antimicrobial mechanisms required for resistance to intracellular pathogens. In addition, recent studies have suggested that the ability of STAT1 to inhibit the activation of STAT4 prevents the development of Th1 responses. However, other studies suggest that STAT1 is required to enhance the expression of T-bet, a transcription factor that promotes Th1 responses. To address the role of STAT1 in resistance to T. gondii, Stat1-/- mice were infected with this pathogen, and their response to infection was assessed. Although Stat1-/- mice produced normal serum levels of IL-12 and IFN-gamma, these mice were unable to control parasite replication and rapidly succumbed to this infection. Susceptibility to toxoplasmosis was associated with an inability to up-regulate MHC expression on macrophages, defects in NO production, and the inability to up-regulate some of the IFN-inducible GTPase family of proteins, molecules associated with antitoxoplasma activity. Analysis of T cell responses revealed that STAT1 was not required for the development of a Th1 response, but was required for the infection-induced up-regulation of T-bet. Together these studies suggest that during toxoplasmosis the major role of STAT1 is not in the development of protective T cell responses, but, rather, STAT1 is important in the development of antimicrobial effector mechanisms.",

It is not clear if a key regulatory transcription factor unites the effector functions of CD8+ T cells. We now show that Eomesodermin (Eomes), a paralogue of T-bet, is induced in effector CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of Eomes was sufficient to invoke attributes of effector CD8+ T cells, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), perforin, and granzyme B. Loss-of-function analysis suggests Eomes may also be necessary for full effector differentiation of CD8+ T cells. We suggest that Eomesodermin is likely to complement the actions of T-bet and act as a key regulatory gene in the development of cell-mediated immunity.",

        "Abstract": "The quality of the helper T cell response against antigen can determine the outcomes of infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. Mature Th1 and Th2 cell subsets are thought to arise from a common naive progenitor. In these precursor cells, effector cytokine genes appear to exist in a restrictive structure, which is determined by methylation of cytosine bases and higher-order structure of chromatin. The restrictive gene structures appear to be plastic, giving way to more active structures in some daughter cells. Some genetic loci, which are active in naive cells, however, become silenced during terminal differentiation. Both the derepression of silent loci and the silencing of active loci appear to be linked to the process of DNA replication. Future investigation will be directed toward understanding the way in which patterns of gene expression are altered or transmitted during the cell division of helper T lymphocytes.",

We examined cells lacking methyl CpG binding domain protein-2 (MBD2), a molecule that has been proposed to link DNA methylation to silent chromatin. Helper T cells from Mbd2(-/-) mice exhibit disordered differentiation. IL-4, the signature of a restricted set of progeny, is expressed ectopically in Mbd2(-/-) parent and daughter cells. Loss of MBD2-mediated silencing renders the normally essential activator, Gata-3, dispensable for IL-4 induction. Gata-3 and MBD2 act in competition, wherein each factor independently, and quantitatively, regulates the binary choice of whether heritable IL-4 expression is established. Gata-3 functions, in part, to displace MBD2 from methylated DNA. These results suggest that activating and silencing signals integrate to provide spatially and temporally restricted patterns of gene activity.",

        "Abstract": "Type 1 helper T (T(H)1) cells are essential for cellular immunity, but their ontogeny, maturation and durability remain poorly understood. By constructing a dominant-negative form of T-bet, we were able to determine the role played by this lineage-inducing trans-activator in the establishment and maintenance of heritable T(H)1 gene expression. Optimal induction of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression required genetic interaction between T-bet and its target, the homeoprotein Hlx. In fully mature T(H)1 cells, reiteration of IFN-gamma expression and stable chromatin remodeling became relatively independent of T-bet activity and coincided with demethylation of DNA. In contrast, some lineage attributes, such as expression of IL-12R beta 2 (interleukin 12 receptor beta 2), required ongoing T-bet activity in mature T(H)1 cells and their progeny. These findings suggest that heritable states of gene expression might be maintained by continued expression of the inducing factor or by a mechanism that confers a stable imprint of the induced state.",
