        "Abstract": "In contrast to most hematopoietic lineages, megakaryocytes (MKs) can derive rapidly and directly from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The underlying mechanism is unclear, however. Here, we show that DNA damage induces MK markers in HSCs and that G2 arrest, an integral part of the DNA damage response, suffices for MK priming followed by irreversible MK differentiation in HSCs, but not in progenitors. We also show that replication stress causes DNA damage in HSCs and is at least in part due to uracil misincorporation in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with this notion, thymidine attenuated DNA damage, improved HSC maintenance, and reduced the generation of CD41",

Here we describe a strategy for directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into distal lung organoids. This protocol recapitulates lung development by sequentially specifying human pluripotent stem cells to definitive endoderm, anterior foregut endoderm, ventral anterior foregut endoderm, lung bud organoids and finally lung organoids. The organoids take ~40 d to generate and can be maintained more than 180 d, while progressively maturing up to a stage consistent with the second trimester of human gestation. They are unique because of their branching morphology, the near absence of non-lung endodermal lineages, presence of mesenchyme and capacity to recapitulate interstitial lung diseases. This protocol can be performed by anyone familiar with cell culture techniques, is conducted in serum-free conditions and does not require lineage-specific reporters or enrichment steps. We also provide a protocol for the generation of single-cell suspensions for single-cell RNA sequencing.",

        "Abstract": "Human lungs contain unique cell populations in distal respiratory airways (RAs). These populations accumulate in patients with lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Their lineage potentials and roles are unknown, however. As they are absent in rodents, deeper understanding of these cells requires a human in vitro model. Here we report the generation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) of expandable spheres (induced respiratory airway progenitors (iRAPs)) consisting of all RA-associated cell types. iRAPs could differentiate into type 1 (AT1) and type 2 alveolar (AT2) epithelial cells in defined conditions, showing that alveolar cells can be derived from RAs. iRAPs with deletion of HPS1, which causes pulmonary fibrosis in humans, display defects that are hallmarks of IPF, indicating involvement of intrinsic dysfunction of RA-associated cells in IPF. iRAPs thus provide a model to gain insight into human lung regeneration and into pathogenesis of IPF.",

        "Abstract": "The specific cellular physiology of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is underexplored, and their maintenance in vitro remains challenging. We discovered that culture of HSCs in low calcium increased their maintenance as determined by phenotype, function, and single-cell expression signature. HSCs are endowed with low intracellular calcium conveyed by elevated activity of glycolysis-fueled plasma membrane calcium efflux pumps and a low-bone-marrow interstitial fluid calcium concentration. Low-calcium conditions inhibited calpain proteases, which target ten-eleven translocated (TET) enzymes, of which TET2 was required for the effect of low calcium conditions on HSC maintenance in vitro. These observations reveal a physiological feature of HSCs that can be harnessed to improve their maintenance in vitro.",

        "Abstract": "Although strategies for directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into lung and airway have been established, terminal maturation of the cells remains a vexing problem. We show here that in collagen I 3D cultures in the absence of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibition, hPSC-derived lung progenitors (LPs) undergo multilineage maturation into proximal cells, type I alveolar epithelial cells and morphologically mature type II cells. Enhanced cell cycling, one of the signaling outputs of GSK3 inhibition, plays a role in the maturation-inhibiting effect of GSK3 inhibition. Using this model, we show NOTCH signaling induced a distal cell fate at the expense of a proximal and ciliated cell fate, whereas WNT signaling promoted a proximal club cell fate, thus implicating both signaling pathways in proximodistal specification in human lung development. These findings establish an approach to achieve multilineage maturation of lung and airway cells from hPSCs, demonstrate a pivotal role of GSK3 in the maturation of lung progenitors and provide novel insight into proximodistal specification during human lung development.",

        "Abstract": "PRDM16 is a transcriptional coregulator involved in translocations in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes, and T acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is highly expressed in and required for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and can be aberrantly expressed in AML. Prdm16 is expressed as full-length (fPrdm16) and short (sPrdm16) isoforms, the latter lacking the N-terminal PR domain. The role of both isoforms in normal and malignant hematopoiesis is unclear. We show here that fPrdm16 was critical for HSC maintenance, induced multiple genes involved in GTPase signaling, and repressed inflammation, while sPrdm16 supported B cell development biased toward marginal zone B cells and induced an inflammatory signature. In a mouse model of human MLL-AF9 leukemia, fPrdm16 extended latency, while sPrdm16 shortened latency and induced a strong inflammatory signature, including several cytokines and chemokines that are associated with myelodysplasia and with a worse prognosis in human AML. Finally, in human NPM1-mutant and in MLL-translocated AML, high expression of PRDM16, which negatively impacts outcome, was associated with inflammatory gene expression, thus corroborating the mouse data. Our observations demonstrate distinct roles for Prdm16 isoforms in normal HSCs and AML, and identify sPrdm16 as one of the drivers of prognostically adverse inflammation in leukemia.",

        "Abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce most cellular energy through glycolysis rather than through mitochondrial respiration. Consistent with this notion, mitochondrial mass has been reported to be low in HSCs. However, we found that staining with MitoTracker Green, a commonly used dye to measure mitochondrial content, leads to artefactually low fluorescence specifically in HSCs because of dye efflux. Using mtDNA quantification, enumeration of mitochondrial nucleoids, and fluorescence intensity of a genetically encoded mitochondrial reporter, we unequivocally show here that HSCs and multipotential progenitors (MPPs) have higher mitochondrial mass than lineage-committed progenitors and mature cells. Despite similar mitochondrial mass, respiratory capacity of MPPs exceeds that of HSCs. Furthermore, although elevated mitophagy has been invoked to explain low mitochondrial mass in HSCs, we observed that mitochondrial turnover capacity is comparatively low in HSCs. We propose that the role of mitochondria in HSC biology may have to be revisited in light of these findings.",

        "Abstract": "Recapitulation of lung development from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in three dimensions (3D) would allow deeper insight into human development, as well as the development of innovative strategies for disease modelling, drug discovery and regenerative medicine. We report here the generation from hPSCs of lung bud organoids (LBOs) that contain mesoderm and pulmonary endoderm and develop into branching airway and early alveolar structures after xenotransplantation and in Matrigel 3D culture. Expression analysis and structural features indicated that the branching structures reached the second trimester of human gestation. Infection in vitro with respiratory syncytial virus, which causes small airway obstruction and bronchiolitis in infants, led to swelling, detachment and shedding of infected cells into the organoid lumens, similar to what has been observed in human lungs. Introduction of mutation in HPS1, which causes an early-onset form of intractable pulmonary fibrosis, led to accumulation of extracellular matrix and mesenchymal cells, suggesting the potential use of this model to recapitulate fibrotic lung disease in vitro. LBOs therefore recapitulate lung development and may provide a useful tool to model lung disease.",

        "Abstract": "Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which sustain production of all blood cell lineages, rely on glycolysis for ATP production, yet little attention has been paid to the role of mitochondria. Here we show in mice that the short isoform of a critical regulator of HSCs, Prdm16 (refs 4, 5), induces mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), a protein involved in mitochondrial fusion and in tethering of mitochondria to the endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression and deletion studies, including single-cell transplantation assays, revealed that Mfn2 is specifically required for the maintenance of HSCs with extensive lymphoid potential, but not, or less so, for the maintenance of myeloid-dominant HSCs. Mfn2 increased buffering of intracellular Ca(2+), an effect mediated through its endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria tethering activity, thereby negatively regulating nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells (Nfat). Nfat inhibition rescued the effects of Mfn2 deletion in HSCs, demonstrating that negative regulation of Nfat is the prime downstream mechanism of Mfn2 in the maintenance of HSCs with extensive lymphoid potential. Mitochondria therefore have an important role in HSCs. These findings provide a mechanism underlying clonal heterogeneity among HSCs and may lead to the design of approaches to bias HSC differentiation into desired lineages after transplantation.",

Here we describe a strategy for directed differentiation of hPSCs into developmental lung progenitors, and their subsequent differentiation into predominantly distal lung epithelial cells. The protocol entails four stages that recapitulate lung development, and it takes ∼50 d. First, definitive endoderm (DE) is induced in the presence of high concentrations of activin A. Subsequently, lung-biased anterior foregut endoderm (AFE) is specified by sequential inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and Wnt signaling. AFE is then ventralized by applying Wnt, BMP, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and retinoic acid (RA) signaling to obtain lung and airway progenitors. Finally, these are further differentiated into more mature epithelial cells types using Wnt, FGF, cAMP and glucocorticoid agonism. This protocol is conducted in defined conditions, it does not involve genetic manipulation of the cells and it results in cultures in which the majority of the cells express markers of various lung and airway epithelial cells, with a predominance of cells identifiable as functional type II alveolar epithelial cells.",

Long-term differentiation of hPSCs in vivo and in vitro yielded basal, goblet, Clara, ciliated, type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells. The type II alveolar epithelial cells were capable of surfactant protein-B uptake and stimulated surfactant release, providing evidence of specific function. Inhibiting or removing retinoic acid, Wnt and BMP-agonists to signaling pathways critical for early lung development in the mouse-recapitulated defects in corresponding genetic mouse knockouts. As this protocol generates most cell types of the respiratory system, it may be useful for deriving patient-specific therapeutic cells.",

        "Abstract": "FLT3 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in acute leukemias. However, the role in leukemogenesis of wild-type (wt) FLT3, which is highly expressed in many hematologic malignancies, is unclear. We show here that in mouse models established by retroviral transduction of leukemic fusion proteins, deletion of Flt3 strongly inhibits MLL-ENL and to lesser extent p210(BCR-ABL)-induced leukemogenesis, but has no effect in MLL-AF9 or AML1-ETO9a models. Flt3 acts at the level of leukemic stem cells (LSCs), as a fraction of LSCs in MLL-ENL, but not in MLL-AF9-induced leukemia, expressed Flt3 in vivo, and Flt3 expression on LSCs was associated with leukemia development in this model. Furthermore, efficiency of MLL-ENL, but not of MLL-AF9-induced leukemia induction was significantly enhanced after transduction of Flt3(+) compared to Flt3(-) wt myeloid progenitors. However, Flt3 is not required for immortalization of bone marrow cells in vitro by MLL-ENL and does not affect colony formation by MLL-ENL LSCs in vitro, suggesting that in vitro models do not reflect the in vivo biology of MLL-ENL leukemia with respect to Flt3 requirement. We conclude that wt Flt3 plays a role in leukemia initiation in vivo, which is, however, not universal.",

Several studies have defined novel stem cells in postnatal lung and airways and implicated their roles in tissue homeostasis and repair. In addition, significant advances in the generation of respiratory epithelium from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) now provide a novel and powerful platform for understanding lung development, modeling pulmonary diseases, and implementing drug screening. Finally, breakthroughs have been made in the generation of decellularized lung matrices that can serve as a scaffold for repopulation with respiratory cells derived from either postnatal or PSCs. These studies are a critical step forward towards the still distant goal of stem cell-based regenerative medicine for diseases of lung and airways.",

        "Abstract": "Hematopoiesis is the process whereby BM HSCs renew to maintain their number or to differentiate into committed progenitors to generate all blood cells. One approach to gain mechanistic insight into this complex process is the investigation of quantitative genetic variation in hematopoietic function among inbred mouse strains. We previously showed that TGF-β2 is a genetically determined positive regulator of hematopoiesis. In the presence of unknown nonprotein serum factors TGF-β2, but not TGF-β1 or -β3, enhances progenitor proliferation in vitro, an effect that is subject to mouse strain-dependent variation mapping to a locus on chr.4, Tb2r1. TGF-β2-deficient mice show hematopoietic defects, demonstrating the physiologic role of this cytokine. Here, we show that TGF-β2 specifically and predominantly cell autonomously enhances signaling by FLT3 in vitro and in vivo. A coding polymorphism in Prdm16 (PR-domain-containing 16) underlies Tb2r1 and differentially regulates transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), identifying lipid PPAR ligands as the serum factors required for regulation of FLT3 signaling by TGF-β2. We furthermore show that PPARγ agonists play a FLT3-dependent role in stress responses of progenitor cells. These observations identify a novel regulatory axis that includes PPARs, Prdm16, and TGF-β2 in hematopoiesis.",

T cells play an important role in adaptive immunity, and their loss or dysfunction underlies in a wide range of autoimmune and infectious diseases. T cells are generated and selected through interaction with thymic epithelial cells, the functionally essential element of thymus.

Thus far, derivation of endodermal lineages has focused predominantly on hepatocytes, pancreatic endocrine cells and intestinal cells. The ability to differentiate pluripotent cells into anterior foregut endoderm (AFE) derivatives would expand their utility for cell therapy and basic research to tissues important for immune function, such as the thymus; for metabolism, such as thyroid and parathyroid; and for respiratory function, such as trachea and lung. We find that dual inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling after specification of definitive endoderm from pluripotent cells results in a highly enriched AFE population that is competent to be patterned along dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes. These findings provide an approach for the generation of AFE derivatives.",

We show here that, within the hematopoietic system, Prdm16 is expressed very selectively in the earliest stem and progenitor compartments, and, consistent with this expression pattern, is critical for the establishment and maintenance of the HSC pool during development and after transplantation. Prdm16 deletion enhances apoptosis and cycling of HSCs. Expression analysis revealed that Prdm16 regulates a remarkable number of genes that, based on knockout models, both enhance and suppress HSC function, and affect quiescence, cell cycling, renewal, differentiation, and apoptosis to various extents. These data suggest that Prdm16 may be a critical node in a network that contains negative and positive feedback loops and integrates HSC renewal, quiescence, apoptosis, and differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "The mechanisms underlying age-associated thymic involution are unknown. In mice, thymic involution shows mouse strain-dependent genetic variation. Identification of the underlying genes would provide mechanistic insight into this elusive process. We previously showed that responsiveness of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to transforming growth factor-beta 2, a positive regulator of HSPC proliferation, is regulated by a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chr. 4, Tb2r1. Interestingly, Tgfb2(+/-) mice have delayed thymic involution. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a QTL on chr. 4 might regulate thymic involution. Aged, but not young, B6.D2-chr.4 congenic mice, where the telomeric region of chr. 4 was introgressed from DBA/2 to C57BL/6 mice, had larger thymi, and better maintenance of early thymic precursors than C57BL/6 control mice. These observations unequivocally demonstrate that the telomeric region of chr. 4 contains a QTL, Ti1 (thymic involution 1) that regulates thymic involution, and suggest the possibility that Ti1 may be identical to Tb2r1.",

        "Abstract": "B cells, the Ab-producing cells of the immune system, develop from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through well-defined stages during which Ig genes are rearranged to generate a clonal BCR. Signaling through the BCR plays a role in the subsequent cell fate decisions leading to the generation of three distinct types of B cells: B1, marginal zone, and follicular B cells. Common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) are descended from HSCs, and although recent observations suggest that CLPs may not be physiological T cell precursors, it is generally accepted that CLPs are obligate progenitors for B cells. In addition, a CLP-like progenitor of unknown significance that lacks expression of c-kit (kit(-)CLP) was recently identified in the mouse model. In this study, we show that CLPs, kit(-)CLPs and a population within the lin(-)Sca1(+)kit(+)flt3(-) HSC compartment generate mature B cell types in different proportions: CLPs and kit(-)CLPs show a stronger marginal zone/follicular ratio than lin(-)Sca1(+)kit(+)flt3(-) cells, whereas kit(-)CLPs show a stronger B1 bias than any other progenitor population. Furthermore, expression of Sca1 on B cells depends on their progenitor origin as B cells derived from CLPs and kit(-)CLPs express more Sca1 than those derived from lin(-)Sca1(+)kit(+)flt3(-) cells. These observations indicate a role for progenitor origin in B cell fate choices and suggest the existence of CLP-independent B cell development.",

        "Abstract": "The significance of a population in mouse bone marrow of lineage-negative (Lin(-)), Sca1-positive, c-kit-negative (LSK(-)) cells, which is reported to be devoid of long-term repopulation capacity or myeloid potential, is unknown. In this study, we show that the LSK(-) population is composed of several subsets defined by the expression of flt3, CD25, and IL-7Ralpha. The first subset was CD25(-) and more than 90% expressed either flt3, IL-7Ralpha, or both. The CD25(-)LSK(-) population had T cell, B cell, and NK cell potential in vivo, and most of this activity was localized in the flt3(+) subset, irrespective of the expression of IL-7Ralpha. Although lymphoid potential of flt3(+)LSK(-) cells in vivo was 3-fold lower than that of lin(-)Sca1(low)kit(low)IL7Ralpha(+) common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), their cloning efficiency in vitro was 10-fold lower than that of CLPs. Furthermore, although the myeloid potential of flt3(+)LSK(-) cells was 10-fold lower than that of CLPs in the absence of M-CSF, the relative myeloid potential of both populations was similar in its presence. These observations suggest differential growth factor requirements of both populations. The second subset of LSK(-) cells was homogeneously CD25(+)flt3(-)IL7Ralpha(+) and could be generated from both CD25(-)LSK(-) cells and from CLPs, but did not engraft in immunodeficient Rag1(-/-) or Rag1(-/-)gamma(c)(-/-) hosts. This population, of which the significance is unclear, was increased in Rag1(-/-) mice and in old mice. Thus, the LSK(-) population is phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous and contains early lymphoid-committed precursors. Our findings imply that the early stages of lymphoid commitment are more complex than was thus far assumed.",

        "Abstract": "The hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment is subject to extensive quantitative genetic variation. We have previously shown that TGF-beta2 at low concentrations enhances flt3 ligand-induced growth of HSPCs, while it is potently antiproliferative at higher concentrations. This in vitro enhancing effect was subject to quantitative genetic variation, for which a quantitative trait locus (QTL) was tentatively mapped to chromosome 4 (chr.4). Tgfb2(+/-) mice have a smaller and more slowly cycling HSPC compartment, which has a decreased serial repopulation capacity, and are less susceptible to the lethal effect of high doses of 5-fluorouracil. To unequivocally demonstrate that these phenotypes can be attributed to the enhancing effect of TGF-beta2 on HSPC proliferation observed in vitro and are therefore subject to mouse strain-dependent variation as well, we generated congenic mice where the telomeric region of chr.4 was introgressed from DBA/2 into C57BL/6 mice. In these mice, the enhancing effect of TGF-beta2 on flt3 signaling, but not the generic antiproliferative effect of high concentrations of TGF-beta2, was abrogated, confirming the location of this QTL, which we named tb2r1, on chr.4. These mice shared a smaller and more slowly cycling HSPC compartment and increased 5-fluorouracil resistance but not a decreased serial repopulation capacity with Tgfb2(+/-) mice. The concordance of phenotypes between Tgfb2(+/-) and congenic mice indicates that HSPC frequency and cycling are regulated by tb2r1, while an additional QTL in the telomeric region of chr.4 may regulate the serial repopulation capacity of hematopoietic stem cells.",

        "Abstract": "We discovered a novel population of gammadelta T cells in the mouse that accumulates with age in hematopoietic organs, but not in epithelia. These cells are CD25low (an unusual phenotype for gammadelta T cells in the mouse); express higher levels of TCRgammadelta and CD44 than do CD25- gammadelta T cells; mainly express Vgamma2, Vgamma3, and Vgamma4 chains; and are largely quiescent. A very similar cell population appears in the late stages of fetal thymus organ cultures, suggesting that the accumulation of CD44 + CD25lowTCRgammadelta + cells is a response to stress induced by aging in vivo or by culture in vitro. The precursors of CD44 + CD25lowTCRgammadelta + cells are generated during fetal or very young adult life, as this population was undetectable in aged recipients of bone marrow from old or young donors. CD44 + CD25lowTCRgammadelta + cells may be a biomarker of aging, but could also play a role in the inflammatory changes that accompany aging.",

In inbred mouse strains the rate of thymic involution and the function of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment are subject to quantitative genetic variation. We have shown previously that transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-beta2) is a genetically determined positive regulator of HSCs. Here, we demonstrate that genetic variation in the rate of thymic involution correlates with genetic variation in the responsiveness of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to TGF-beta2. Corroborating these correlations, thymic cellularity and peripheral naive T-cell frequency were higher in old Tgfb2+/- mice than in wild-type littermates. The frequency of early T-cell precursors was increased in Tgfb2+/- mice, suggesting that TGF-beta2 affects the earliest stages of T-cell development in old mice. Reciprocal transplantation experiments indicated that TGF-beta2 expressed both in the (micro)environment and in the hematopoietic system can accelerate thymic involution; however, the age of the stem cells appeared irrelevant. Thus, although thymic involution is largely determined by the aged environment, TGF-beta2 plays a major modulatory role that is subject to genetic variation and is possibly mediated through its regulatory effects on early hematopoiesis.",

        "Abstract": "TGF-beta is considered a negative regulator of hemopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We have previously shown that one TGF-beta isoform, TGF-beta2, is, in fact, a positive regulator of murine hemopoietic stem cell function in vivo. In vitro, TGF-beta2, but not TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, had a biphasic dose response on the proliferation of purified lin-Sca1(++)kit(+) (LSK) cells, with a stimulatory effect at low concentrations, which was subject to mouse strain-dependent variation. In this study we report that the stimulatory effect of TGF-beta2 on the proliferation of LSK cells increases with age and after replicative stress in C57BL/6, but not in DBA/2, mice. The age-related changes in the TGF-beta2 effect correlated with life span in BXD recombinant strains. The stimulatory effect of TGF-beta2 on the proliferation of LSK cells requires one or more nonprotein, low m.w. factors present in fetal calf and mouse sera. The activity of this factor(s) in mouse serum increases with age. Taken together, our data suggest a role for TGF-beta2 and as yet unknown serum factors in the aging of the hemopoietic stem cell compartment and possibly in organismal aging.",

Because some traits affecting hematopoiesis also change with age in a mouse strain-dependent fashion, we performed quantitative trait analysis in aged BXD recombinant inbred (RI) mice for the number and frequency of LSK cells, and for their proliferative capacity in vitro. Several novel QTL were identified. The number and frequency of LSK cells in old mice correlated inversely with lifespan. Furthermore, 4 of 7 lifespan QTL overlap with QTL contributing to the number, frequency, or proliferative capacity of LSK cells in young or old mice. Taken together, these data establish a close genetic, and perhaps functional, link between genetic variation in lifespan and characteristics of stem and progenitor cells.",

        "Abstract": "Elucidation of pathways involved in mouse strain-dependent variation in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment may reveal novel mechanisms relevant in vivo. Here, we demonstrate genetically determined variation in the proliferation of lin-Sca1++kit+ (LSK) primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells in response to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) 2, the dose response of which was biphasic with a stimulatory effect at low concentrations. In contrast, the dose responses of TGF-beta1 or -beta3 were inhibitory and did not show mouse strain-dependent variation. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for the effect of TGF-beta2 was identified on chromosome 4 overlapping with a QTL regulating the frequency of LSK cells. These overlapping QTL were corroborated by the observation that the frequency of LSK cells is lower in adult Tgfb2+/- mice than in wild-type littermates, indicating that TGF-beta2 is a genetically determined positive regulator LSK number in vivo. Furthermore, adult Tgfb2+/- mice have a defect in competitive repopulation potential that becomes more pronounced upon serial transplantation. In fetal TGF-beta2-deficient HSCs, a defect only appears after serial reconstitution. These data suggest that TGF-beta2 can act cell autonomously and is important for HSCs that have undergone replicative stress. Thus, TGF-beta2 is a novel, genetically determined positive regulator of adult HSCs.",

        "Abstract": "Quantitative trait analysis may shed light on mechanisms regulating hematopoiesis in vivo. Strain-dependent variation existed among C57BL/6 (B6), DBA/2, and BXD recombinant inbred mice in the responsiveness of primitive progenitor cells to the early-acting cytokines kit ligand, flt3 ligand, and thrombopoietin. A significant quantitative trait locus was found on chromosome 2 that could not be confirmed in congenic mice, however, probably because of epistasis. Because it has been shown that alleles of unknown X-linked genes confer a selective advantage to hematopoietic stem cells in vivo in humans and in cats, we also analyzed reciprocal male D2B6F1 and B6D2F1 mice, revealing an X-linked locus regulating the responsiveness of progenitor and stem cells to early-acting factors. Among DBA/2, B6, and BXD recombinant inbred mice, correlating genetic variation was found in the absolute number and frequency of Lin(-)Sca1(++)kit(+) cells, which are highly enriched in hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells, and in the number of Lin(-)Sca1(++)kit(-) cells, a population whose biologic significance is unknown, suggesting that both populations are functionally related. Suggestive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the number of Lin(-)Sca1(++) cells on chromosomes 2, 4, and 7 were confirmed in successive rounds of mapping. The locus on chromosome 2 was confirmed in congenic mice. We thus demonstrated genetic variation in the response to cytokines critical for hematopoiesis in vivo and in the pool size of cells belonging to a phenotype used to isolate essentially pure primitive progenitor and stem cells, and we identified loci that may be relevant to the regulation of hematopoiesis in steady state.",
