        "Abstract": "The hippocampus is critical for memory and spatial navigation. The ability to map novel environments, as well as more abstract conceptual relationships, is fundamental to the cognitive flexibility that humans and other animals require to survive in a dynamic world. In this review, we survey recent advances in our understanding of how this flexibility is implemented anatomically and functionally by hippocampal circuitry, during both active exploration (online) and rest (offline). We discuss the advantages and limitations of spike timing-dependent plasticity and the more recently discovered behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity in supporting distinct learning modes in the hippocampus. Finally, we suggest complementary roles for these plasticity types in explaining many-shot and single-shot learning in the hippocampus and discuss how these rules could work together to support the learning of cognitive maps.",

        "Title": "A Generative Neighborhood-Based Deep Autoencoder for Robust Imbalanced Classification.",
        "Abstract": "Deep learning models perform remarkably well on many classification tasks recently. The superior performance of deep neural networks relies on the large number of training data, which at the same time must have an equal class distribution in order to be efficient. However, in most real-world applications, the labeled data may be limited with high imbalance ratios among the classes, and thus, the learning process of most classification algorithms is adversely affected resulting in unstable predictions and low performance. Three main categories of approaches address the problem of imbalanced learning, i.e., data-level, algorithmic level, and hybrid methods, which combine the two aforementioned approaches. Data generative methods are typically based on generative adversarial networks, which require significant amounts of data, while model-level methods entail extensive domain expert knowledge to craft the learning objectives, thereby being less accessible for users without such knowledge. Moreover, the vast majority of these approaches are designed and applied to imaging applications, less to time series, and extremely rare to both of them. To address the above issues, we introduce GENDA, a generative neighborhood-based deep autoencoder, which is simple yet effective in its design and can be successfully applied to both image and time-series data. GENDA is based on learning latent representations that rely on the neighboring embedding space of the samples. Extensive experiments, conducted on a variety of widely-used real datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

        "Abstract": "Investigators conducting behavioral experiments often need precise control over the timing of the delivery of stimuli to subjects and to collect the precise times of the subsequent behavioral responses. Furthermore, investigators want fine-tuned control over how various multi-modal cues are presented. behaviorMate takes an \"Intranet of Things\" approach, using a networked system of hardware and software components for achieving these goals. The system outputs a file with integrated timestamp-event pairs that investigators can then format and process using their own analysis pipelines. We present an overview of the electronic components and GUI application that make up behaviorMate as well as mechanical designs for compatible experimental rigs to provide the reader with the ability to set up their own system. A wide variety of paradigms are supported, including goal-oriented learning, random foraging, and context switching. We demonstrate behaviorMate's utility and reliability with a range of use cases from several published studies and benchmark tests. Finally, we present experimental validation demonstrating different modalities of hippocampal place field studies. Both treadmill with burlap belt and virtual reality with running wheel paradigms were performed to confirm the efficacy and flexibility of the approach. Previous solutions rely on proprietary systems that may have large upfront costs or present frameworks that require customized software to be developed. behaviorMate uses open-source software and a flexible configuration system to mitigate both concerns. behaviorMate has a proven record for head-fixed imaging experiments and could be easily adopted for task control in a variety of experimental situations.",

        "Abstract": "The subregions of the entorhinal cortex (EC) are conventionally thought to compute dichotomous representations for spatial processing, with the medial EC (MEC) providing a global spatial map and the lateral EC (LEC) encoding specific sensory details of experience. Yet, little is known about the specific types of information EC transmits downstream to the hippocampus. Here, we exploit in vivo sub-cellular imaging to record from EC axons in CA1 while mice perform navigational tasks in virtual reality (VR). We uncover distinct yet overlapping representations of task, location, and context in both MEC and LEC axons. MEC transmitted highly location- and context-specific codes; LEC inputs were biased by ongoing navigational goals. However, during tasks with reliable reward locations, the animals' position could be accurately decoded from either subregion. Our results revise the prevailing dogma about EC information processing, revealing novel ways spatial and non-spatial information is routed and combined upstream of the hippocampus.",

        "Abstract": "Recurrent excitatory connections in hippocampal regions CA3 and CA2 are thought to play a key role in the generation of sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), electrophysiological oscillations tightly linked with learning and memory consolidation. However, it remains unknown how defined populations of inhibitory interneurons regulate these events during behavior. Here, we use large-scale, three-dimensional calcium imaging and retrospective molecular identification in the mouse hippocampus to characterize molecularly identified CA3 and CA2 interneuron activity during SWR-associated memory consolidation and spatial navigation. We describe subtype- and region-specific responses during behaviorally distinct brain states and find that SWRs are preceded by decreased cholecystokinin-expressing interneuron activity and followed by increased parvalbumin-expressing basket cell activity. The magnitude of these dynamics correlates with both SWR duration and behavior during hippocampal-dependent learning. Together these results assign subtype- and region-specific roles for inhibitory circuits in coordinating operations and learning-related plasticity in hippocampal recurrent circuits.",

Its distinct anatomy has long inspired theories that rely on local interactions between neurons within each subregion in order to perform serial operations important for memory encoding and storage. These local computations have received less attention in CA1 area, the primary output node of the hippocampus, where excitatory neurons are thought to be only very sparsely interconnected. However, recent findings have demonstrated the power of local circuitry in CA1, with evidence for strong functional interactions among excitatory neurons, regulation by diverse inhibitory microcircuits, and novel plasticity rules that can profoundly reshape the hippocampal ensemble code. Here we review how these properties expand the dynamical repertoire of CA1 beyond the confines of feedforward processing, and what implications they have for hippocampo-cortical functions in memory formation.",

        "Abstract": "Neurons in the hippocampus exhibit a striking selectivity for specific combinations of sensory features, forming representations that are thought to subserve episodic memory. Even during completely novel experiences, hippocampal \"place cells\" are rapidly configured such that the population sparsely encodes visited locations, stabilizing within minutes of the first exposure to a new environment. What mechanisms enable this fast encoding of experience? Using virtual reality and neural population recordings in mice, we dissected the effects of novelty and experience on the dynamics of place field formation. During place field formation, many CA1 neurons immediately modulated the amplitude of their activity and shifted the location of their field, rapid changes in tuning predicted by behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). Signatures of BTSP were particularly enriched during the exploration of a novel context and decayed with experience. Our data suggest that novelty modulates the effective learning rate in CA1, favoring rapid mechanisms of field formation to encode a new experience.",

        "Abstract": "Dendritic calcium signaling is central to neural plasticity mechanisms that allow animals to adapt to the environment. Intracellular calcium release (ICR) from the endoplasmic reticulum has long been thought to shape these mechanisms. However, ICR has not been investigated in mammalian neurons in vivo. We combined electroporation of single CA1 pyramidal neurons, simultaneous imaging of dendritic and somatic activity during spatial navigation, optogenetic place field induction, and acute genetic augmentation of ICR cytosolic impact to reveal that ICR supports the establishment of dendritic feature selectivity and shapes integrative properties determining output-level receptive fields. This role for ICR was more prominent in apical than in basal dendrites. Thus, ICR cooperates with circuit-level architecture in vivo to promote the emergence of behaviorally relevant plasticity in a compartment-specific manner.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampus plays a critical role in memory consolidation, mediated by coordinated network activity during sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events. Despite the link between SWRs and hippocampal plasticity, little is known about how network state affects information processing in dendrites, the primary sites of synaptic input integration and plasticity. Here, we monitored somatic and basal dendritic activity in CA1 pyramidal cells in behaving mice using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging integrated with simultaneous local field potential recordings. We found immobility was associated with an increase in dendritic activity concentrated during SWRs. Coincident dendritic and somatic activity during SWRs predicted increased coupling during subsequent exploration of a novel environment. In contrast, somatic-dendritic coupling and SWR recruitment varied with cells' tuning distance to reward location during a goal-learning task. Our results connect SWRs with the stabilization of information processing within CA1 neurons and suggest that these mechanisms may be dynamically biased by behavioral demands.",

        "Abstract": "Much of our understanding of dendritic and synaptic physiology comes from in vitro experimentation, where the afforded mechanical stability and convenience of applying drugs allowed patch-clamping based recording techniques to investigate ion channel distributions, their gating kinetics, and to uncover dendritic integrative and synaptic plasticity rules. However, with current efforts to study these questions in vivo, there is a great need to translate existing knowledge between in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions. In this review, we identify discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo ionic composition of extracellular media and discuss how changes in ionic composition alter dendritic excitability and plasticity induction. Here, we argue that under physiological in vivo ionic conditions, dendrites are expected to be more excitable and the threshold for synaptic plasticity induction to be lowered. Consequently, the plasticity rules described in vitro vary significantly from those implemented in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Hippocampal place cells underlie spatial navigation and memory. Remarkably, CA1 pyramidal neurons can form new place fields within a single trial by undergoing rapid plasticity. However, local feedback circuits likely restrict the rapid recruitment of individual neurons into ensemble representations. This interaction between circuit dynamics and rapid feature coding remains unexplored. Here, we developed \"all-optical\" approaches combining novel optogenetic induction of rapidly forming place fields with 2-photon activity imaging during spatial navigation in mice. We find that induction efficacy depends strongly on the density of co-activated neurons. Place fields can be reliably induced in single cells, but induction fails during co-activation of larger subpopulations due to local circuit constraints imposed by recurrent inhibition. Temporary relief of local inhibition permits the simultaneous induction of place fields in larger ensembles. We demonstrate the behavioral implications of these dynamics, showing that our ensemble place field induction protocol can enhance subsequent spatial association learning.",

        "Abstract": "Spatial memories that can last a lifetime are thought to be encoded during 'online' periods of exploration and subsequently consolidated into stable cognitive maps through their 'offline' reactivation. However, the mechanisms and computational principles by which offline reactivation stabilize long-lasting spatial representations remain poorly understood. Here, we employed simultaneous fast calcium imaging and electrophysiology to track hippocampal place cells over 2 weeks of online spatial reward learning behavior and offline resting. We describe that recruitment to persistent network-level offline reactivation of spatial experiences in mice predicts the future representational stability of place cells days in advance of their online reinstatement. Moreover, while representations of reward-adjacent locations are generally more stable across days, offline-reactivation-related stability is, conversely, most prominent for reward-distal locations. Thus, while occurring on the tens of milliseconds timescale, offline reactivation is uniquely associated with the stability of multiday representations that counterbalance the overall reward-adjacency bias, thereby predicting the stabilization of cognitive maps that comprehensively reflect entire underlying spatial contexts. These findings suggest that post-learning offline-related memory consolidation plays a complimentary and computationally distinct role in learning compared to online encoding.",

        "Abstract": "Cortical computations are critically reliant on their local circuit, GABAergic cells. In the hippocampus, a large body of work has identified an unprecedented diversity of GABAergic interneurons with pronounced anatomical, molecular, and physiological differences. Yet little is known about the functional properties and activity dynamics of the major hippocampal interneuron classes in behaving animals. Here we use fast, targeted, three-dimensional (3D) two-photon calcium imaging coupled with immunohistochemistry-based molecular identification to retrospectively map in vivo activity onto multiple classes of interneurons in the mouse hippocampal area CA1 during head-fixed exploration and goal-directed learning. We find examples of preferential subtype recruitment with quantitative differences in response properties and feature selectivity during key behavioral tasks and states. These results provide new insights into the collective organization of local inhibitory circuits supporting navigational and mnemonic functions of the hippocampus.",

        "Abstract": "Episodic memory requires linking events in time, a function dependent on the hippocampus. In \"trace\" fear conditioning, animals learn to associate a neutral cue with an aversive stimulus despite their separation in time by a delay period on the order of tens of seconds. But how this temporal association forms remains unclear. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging of neural population dynamics throughout the course of learning and show that, in contrast to previous theories, hippocampal CA1 does not generate persistent activity to bridge the delay. Instead, learning is concomitant with broad changes in the active neural population. Although neural responses were stochastic in time, cue identity could be read out from population activity over longer timescales after learning. These results question the ubiquity of seconds-long neural sequences during temporal association learning and suggest that trace fear conditioning relies on mechanisms that differ from persistent activity accounts of working memory.",

        "Abstract": "During spatial learning, hippocampal (HPC) place maps reorganize to represent new goal locations, but little is known about the circuit mechanisms facilitating these changes. Here, we examined how neuromodulation via locus coeruleus (LC) projections to HPC area CA1 (LC-CA1) regulates the overrepresentation of CA1 place cells near rewarded locations. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we monitored the activity of LC-CA1 fibers in the mouse dorsal HPC. We find that the LC-CA1 projection signals the translocation of a reward, predicting behavioral performance on a goal-oriented spatial learning task. An optogenetic stimulation mimicking this LC-CA1 activity induces place cell reorganization around a familiar reward, while its inhibition decreases the degree of overrepresentation around a translocated reward. Our results show that LC acts in conjunction with other factors to induce goal-directed reorganization of HPC representations and provide a better understanding of the role of neuromodulatory actions on HPC place map plasticity.",

However, heterogeneity within hippocampal principal cell populations, in particular within pyramidal cells at the main CA1 output node, is increasingly recognized and includes developmental, molecular, anatomical, and functional differences. Here we review recent progress in the delineation of hippocampal principal cell subpopulations by focusing on radially defined subpopulations of CA1 pyramidal cells, and we consider how functional segregation of information streams, in parallel channels with nonuniform properties, could represent a general organizational principle of the hippocampus supporting diverse behaviors.",

        "Abstract": "The mammalian hippocampus is critical for spatial information processing and episodic memory. Its primary output cells, CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1 PCs), vary in genetics, morphology, connectivity, and electrophysiological properties. It is therefore possible that distinct CA1 PC subpopulations encode different features of the environment and differentially contribute to learning. To test this hypothesis, we optically monitored activity in deep and superficial CA1 PCs segregated along the radial axis of the mouse hippocampus and assessed the relationship between sublayer dynamics and learning. Superficial place maps were more stable than deep during head-fixed exploration. Deep maps, however, were preferentially stabilized during goal-oriented learning, and representation of the reward zone by deep cells predicted task performance. These findings demonstrate that superficial CA1 PCs provide a more stable map of an environment, while their counterparts in the deep sublayer provide a more flexible representation that is shaped by learning about salient features in the environment.

        "Abstract": "We present a model for neural circuit mechanisms underlying hippocampal memory. Central to this model are nonlinear interactions between anatomically and functionally segregated inputs onto dendrites of pyramidal cells in hippocampal areas CA3 and CA1. We study the consequences of such interactions using model neurons in which somatic burst-firing and synaptic plasticity are controlled by conjunctive processing of these separately integrated input pathways. We find that nonlinear dendritic input processing enhances the model's capacity to store and retrieve large numbers of similar memories. During memory encoding, CA3 stores heavily decorrelated engrams to prevent interference between similar memories, while CA1 pairs these engrams with information-rich memory representations that will later provide meaningful output signals during memory recall. While maintaining mathematical tractability, this model brings theoretical study of memory operations closer to the hippocampal circuit's anatomical and physiological properties, thus providing a framework for future experimental and theoretical study of hippocampal function.",

        "Abstract": "Virally based transsynaptic tracing technologies are powerful experimental tools for neuronal circuit mapping. The glycoprotein-deletion variant of the SAD-B19 vaccine strain rabies virus (RABV) has been the reagent of choice in monosynaptic tracing, since it permits the mapping of synaptic inputs to genetically marked neurons. Since its introduction, new helper viruses and reagents that facilitate complementation have enhanced the efficiency of SAD-B19(ΔG) transsynaptic transfer, but there has been little focus on improvements to the core RABV strain. Here we generate a new deletion mutant strain, CVS-N2c(ΔG), and examine its neuronal toxicity and efficiency in directing retrograde transsynaptic transfer. We find that by comparison with SAD-B19(ΔG), the CVS-N2c(ΔG) strain exhibits a reduction in neuronal toxicity and a marked enhancement in transsynaptic neuronal transfer. We conclude that the CVS-N2c(ΔG) strain provides a more effective means of mapping neuronal circuitry and of monitoring and manipulating neuronal activity in vivo in the mammalian CNS.",

However, analysis of dynamic fluorescence imaging data remains burdensome, in part due to the shortage of available software tools. To address this need, we have developed SIMA, an open source Python package that facilitates common analysis tasks related to fluorescence imaging. Functionality of this package includes correction of motion artifacts occurring during in vivo imaging with laser-scanning microscopy, segmentation of imaged fields into regions of interest (ROIs), and extraction of signals from the segmented ROIs. We have also developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for manual editing of the automatically segmented ROIs and automated registration of ROIs across multiple imaging datasets. This software has been designed with flexibility in mind to allow for future extension with different analysis methods and potential integration with other packages. Software, documentation, and source code for the SIMA package and ROI Buddy GUI are freely available at http://www.losonczylab.org/sima/.",

        "Abstract": "Fear memories guide adaptive behavior in contexts associated with aversive events. The hippocampus forms a neural representation of the context that predicts aversive events. Representations of context incorporate multisensory features of the environment, but must somehow exclude sensory features of the aversive event itself. We investigated this selectivity using cell type-specific imaging and inactivation in hippocampal area CA1 of behaving mice. Aversive stimuli activated CA1 dendrite-targeting interneurons via cholinergic input, leading to inhibition of pyramidal cell distal dendrites receiving aversive sensory excitation from the entorhinal cortex. Inactivating dendrite-targeting interneurons during aversive stimuli increased CA1 pyramidal cell population responses and prevented fear learning. We propose subcortical activation of dendritic inhibition as a mechanism for exclusion of aversive stimuli from hippocampal contextual representations during fear learning.",

Using two-photon Ca(2+) imaging of axonal boutons in hippocampal CA1 of behaving mice, we found that populations of septo-hippocampal GABAergic boutons were activated during locomotion and salient sensory events; sensory responses scaled with stimulus intensity and were abolished by anesthesia. We found similar activity patterns among boutons with common putative postsynaptic targets, with low-dimensional bouton population dynamics being driven primarily by presynaptic spiking.",

        "Abstract": "A consortium of inhibitory neurons control the firing patterns of pyramidal cells, but their specific roles in the behaving animal are largely unknown. We performed simultaneous physiological recordings and optogenetic silencing of either perisomatic (parvalbumin (PV) expressing) or dendrite-targeting (somatostatin (SOM) expressing) interneurons in hippocampal area CA1 of head-fixed mice actively moving a treadmill belt rich with visual-tactile stimuli. Silencing of either PV or SOM interneurons increased the firing rates of pyramidal cells selectively in their place fields, with PV and SOM interneurons having their largest effect during the rising and decaying parts of the place field, respectively. SOM interneuron silencing powerfully increased burst firing without altering the theta phase of spikes. In contrast, PV interneuron silencing had no effect on burst firing, but instead shifted the spikes' theta phase toward the trough of theta. These findings indicate that perisomatic and dendritic inhibition have distinct roles in controlling the rate, burst and timing of hippocampal pyramidal cells.",

        "Abstract": "Transforming synaptic input into action potential output is a fundamental function of neurons. The pattern of action potential output from principal cells of the mammalian hippocampus encodes spatial and nonspatial information, but the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which neurons transform their synaptic input into a given output are unknown. Using a combination of optical activation and cell type-specific pharmacogenetic silencing in vitro, we found that dendritic inhibition is the primary regulator of input-output transformations in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and acts by gating the dendritic electrogenesis driving burst spiking. Dendrite-targeting interneurons are themselves modulated by interneurons targeting pyramidal cell somata, providing a synaptic substrate for tuning pyramidal cell output through interactions in the local inhibitory network. These results provide evidence for a division of labor in cortical circuits, where distinct computational functions are implemented by subtypes of local inhibitory neurons.",

The NPP-caged L-glutamate (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives, which have an extended π-electron system bearing two carboxylates or phosphates were highly soluble (>50 mM) and hydrolytically stable at physiological pH. Uncaging GABA with ultraviolet light blocked network oscillations in layer 1 of the neocortex of a living mouse. Two-photon photolysis of caged Glu at single spine heads evoked changes in membrane voltage that were identical to synaptic stimulations. The implications of solubility complexities for the further development of the NPP scaffold for neurotransmitter uncaging are discussed in the context of other recent developments in this area.",

        "Abstract": "Although hippocampal theta oscillations represent a prime example of temporal coding in the mammalian brain, little is known about the specific biophysical mechanisms. Intracellular recordings support a particular abstract oscillatory interference model of hippocampal theta activity, the soma-dendrite interference model. To gain insight into the cellular and circuit level mechanisms of theta activity, we implemented a similar form of interference using the actual hippocampal network in mice in vitro. We found that pairing increasing levels of phasic dendritic excitation with phasic stimulation of perisomatic projecting inhibitory interneurons induced a somatic polarization and action potential timing profile that reproduced most common features. Alterations in the temporal profile of inhibition were required to fully capture all features. These data suggest that theta-related place cell activity is generated through an interaction between a phasic dendritic excitation and a phasic perisomatic shunting inhibition delivered by interneurons, a subset of which undergo activity-dependent presynaptic modulation.",

We found that experience in an enriched environment increased propagation of dendritic Na(+) spikes in a subset of individual dendritic branches in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and that this effect was mainly mediated by localized downregulation of A-type K(+) channel function.

Although this modulatory effect is thought to be mediated mainly by slow nonsynaptic metabotropic receptors, other mechanisms, such as direct synaptic transmission, are possible. Yet, it is currently unknown if any such form of subcortical control exists. Here, we present direct evidence of a strong, spatiotemporally precise excitatory input from an ascending neuromodulatory center. Selective stimulation of serotonergic median raphe neurons produced a rapid activation of hippocampal interneurons. At the network level, this subcortical drive was manifested as a pattern of effective disynaptic GABAergic inhibition that spread throughout the circuit. This form of subcortical network regulation should be incorporated into current concepts of normal and pathological cortical function.",

        "Abstract": "Although information storage in the central nervous system is thought to be primarily mediated by various forms of synaptic plasticity, other mechanisms, such as modifications in membrane excitability, are available. Local dendritic spikes are nonlinear voltage events that are initiated within dendritic branches by spatially clustered and temporally synchronous synaptic input. That local spikes selectively respond only to appropriately correlated input allows them to function as input feature detectors and potentially as powerful information storage mechanisms. However, it is currently unknown whether any effective form of local dendritic spike plasticity exists. Here we show that the coupling between local dendritic spikes and the soma of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons can be modified in a branch-specific manner through an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent regulation of dendritic Kv4.2 potassium channels. These data suggest that compartmentalized changes in branch excitability could store multiple complex features of synaptic input, such as their spatio-temporal correlation. We propose that this 'branch strength potentiation' represents a previously unknown form of information storage that is distinct from that produced by changes in synaptic efficacy both at the mechanistic level and in the type of information stored.",

        "Abstract": "Back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) are involved in associative synaptic plasticity and the modulation of dendritic excitability. We have used high-speed confocal and two-photon imaging to measure calcium and voltage signals associated with action potential propagation into oblique branches of CA1 pyramidal neurons in adult hippocampal slices. The spatial profile of the bAP-associated Ca(2+) influx was biphasic, with an initial increase in the proximity of the branch point followed by a progressive decrease. Voltage imaging in the branches showed that bAP amplitude was initially constant and then steadily declined with distance from the soma. To determine the role of transient K(+) channels in this profile, we used external Ba(2+) (150 microm) as a channel blocker, after characterizing its effect on A-type K(+) channels in the apical trunk. Bath application of Ba(2+) significantly reduced the A-type K(+) current in outside-out patches and nearly eliminated the distance-dependent decrease in bAP amplitude and its associated Ca(2+) signal. Finally, small amplitude bAPs at more distal oblique branch locations could be boosted by simultaneous branch depolarization, such that the paired Ca(2+) signal became nearly the same for proximal and distal oblique dendrites. These data suggest that dendritic K(+) channels regulate the amplitude of bAPs to create a dendritic Ca(2+) signal whose magnitude is inversely related to the electrotonic distance from the soma when bAPs are not associated with a significant amount of localized synaptic input. This distance-dependent Ca(2+) signal from bAPs, however, can be amplified and a strong associative signal is produced once the proper correlation between synaptic activation and AP output is achieved. We hypothesize that these two signals may be involved in the regulation of the expression and activity of dendritic voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels.",

We have used multisite two-photon glutamate uncaging to deliver different spatiotemporal input patterns to single branches while simultaneously recording the uncaging-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials and local Ca2+ signals. Asynchronous input patterns sum linearly in spite of the spatial clustering and produce Ca2+ signals that are mediated by NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Appropriately timed and sized input patterns ( approximately 20 inputs within approximately 6 ms) produce a supralinear summation due to the initiation of a dendritic spike. The Ca2+ signals associated with synchronous input were larger and mediated by influx through both NMDARs and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). The oblique spike is a fast Na+ spike whose duration is shaped by the coincident activation of NMDAR, VGCCs, and transient K+ currents. Our results suggest that individual branches can function as single integrative compartments.",

        "Abstract": "Cortical information processing requires an orchestrated interaction between a large number of pyramidal cells and albeit fewer, but highly diverse GABAergic interneurons (INs). The diversity of INs is thought to reflect functional and structural specializations evolved to control distinct network operations. Consequently, specific cortical functions may be selectively modified by altering the input-output relationship of unique IN populations. Here, we report that persistently active cannabinoid receptors, the site of action of endocannabinoids, and the psychostimulants marijuana and hashish, switch off the output (mute) of a unique class of hippocampal INs. In paired recordings between cholecystokinin-immunopositive, mossy fiber-associated INs, and their target CA3 pyramidal cells, no postsynaptic currents could be evoked with single presynaptic action potentials or with repetitive stimulations at frequencies <25 Hz. Cannabinoid receptor antagonists converted these \"mute\" synapses into high-fidelity ones. The selective muting of specific GABAergic INs, achieved by persistent presynaptic cannabinoid receptor activation, provides a state-dependent switch in cortical networks.",

        "Title": "Reduction of excitatory postsynaptic responses by persistently active metabotropic glutamate receptors in the hippocampus.",
        "Abstract": "The release of glutamate from axon terminals is under the control of a variety of presynaptic receptors, including several metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Synaptically released glutamate can activate mGluRs within the same synapse where it was released and also at a distance following its diffusion from the synaptic cleft. It is unknown, however, whether the release of glutamate is under the control of persistently active mGluRs. We tested the contribution of mGluR activation to the excitatory postsynaptic responses recorded from several types of GABAergic interneuron in strata oriens/alveus of the mouse hippocampus. The application of 1 microM (alphaS)-alpha-amino-alpha-[(1S,2S)-2-carboxycyclopropyl]xanthine-9-propanoic acid (LY341495), a broad-spectrum mGluR (subtypes 2/3/7/8) antagonist at this concentration, increased evoked-excitatory postsynaptic current (eEPSC) amplitudes by 60% (n = 33). On identified cell types, LY341495 had either no effect (7 of 14 basket and 7 of 13 oriens-lacunosum moleculare, O-LM cells) or resulted in a 32 +/- 30% (mean +/- SD) increase in EPSC amplitudes recorded from basket cells and a seven-times greater (216 +/- 102%) enhancement of EPSCs in O-LM cells. The enhancement of the first EPSC of a high-frequency train indicates persistent mGluR activation. During antagonist application, the relative increase in EPSC amplitude evoked by the second and subsequent pulses in the train was not larger than that of the first EPSC, showing no further receptor activation by the released transmitter. The effect of mGluR subtype selective agonists [3 microM L(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4): mGluR4/8; 600 microM L-AP4: mGluR4/7/8; 1 microM (2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IU): mGluR2/3] and an antagonist (0.2 microM LY341495: mGluR2/3/8) suggests that persistently active mGluR2/3/8 control the excitability of hippocampal network.",

        "Title": "Cell type dependence and variability in the short-term plasticity of EPSCs in identified mouse hippocampal interneurones.",
        "Abstract": "Synapses exhibit different short-term plasticity patterns and this behaviour influences information processing in neuronal networks. We tested how the short-term plasticity of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) depends on the postsynaptic cell type, identified by axonal arborizations and molecular markers in the hippocampal CA1 area. Three distinct types of short-term synaptic behaviour (facilitating, depressing and combined facilitating-depressing) were defined by fitting a dynamic neurotransmission model to the data. Approximately 75 % of the oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) interneurones received facilitating EPSCs, but in three of 12 O-LM cells EPSCs also showed significant depression. Over 90 % of the O-LM cells were immunopositive for somatostatin and mGluR1alpha and all tested cells were decorated by strongly mGluR7a positive axon terminals. Responses in eight of 12 basket cells were described well with a model involving only depression, but the other cells displayed combined facilitating-depressing EPSCs. No apparent difference was found between the plasticity of EPSCs in cholecystokinin- or parvalbumin-containing basket cells. In oriens-bistratified cells (O-Bi), two of nine cells showed facilitating EPSCs, another two depressing, and the remaining five cells combined facilitating-depressing EPSCs. Seven of 10 cells tested for somatostatin were immunopositive, but mGluR1alpha was detectable only in two of 11 tested cells. Furthermore, most O-Bi cells projected to the CA3 area and the subiculum, as well as outside the hippocampal formation. Postsynaptic responses to action potentials recorded in vivo from a CA1 place cell were modelled, and revealed great differences between and within cell types. Our results demonstrate that the short-term plasticity of EPSCs is cell type dependent, but with significant heterogeneity within all three interneurone populations.",
