        "Title": "The dynamics and regulation of PARP1 and PARP2 in response to DNA damage and during replication.",
        "Abstract": "DNA strand breaks activate Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1 and 2, which use NAD+ as the substrate to covalently conjugate ADP-ribose on themselves and other proteins (e.g., Histone) to promote chromatin relaxation and recruit additional DNA repair factors. Enzymatic inhibitors of PARP1 and PARP2 (PARPi) are promising cancer therapy agents that selectively target BRCA1- or BRCA2- deficient cancers. As immediate early responders to DNA strand breaks with robust activities, PARP1 and PARP2 normally form transient foci (<10 minutes) at the micro-irradiation-induced DNA lesions. In addition to enzymatic inhibition, PARPi also extend the presence of PARP1 and PARP2 at DNA lesions, including at replication forks, where they may post a physical block for subsequent repair and DNA replication. The dynamic nature of PARP1 and PARP2 foci made live cell imaging a unique platform to detect subtle changes and the functional interaction among PARP1, PARP2, and their regulators. Recent imaging studies have provided new understandings of the biological consequence of PARP inhibition and uncovered functional interactions between PARP1 and PARP2 and new regulators (e.g., histone poly(ADP-ribosylation) factor). Here, we review recent advances in dissecting the temporal and spatial Regulation of PARP1 and PARP2 at DNA lesions and discuss their physiological implications on both cancer and normal cells.",

        "Abstract": "Poly-ADP-ribose polymerases 1 and 2 (PARP1 and PARP2) are crucial sensors of DNA-strand breaks and emerging cancer therapy targets. Once activated by DNA breaks, PARP1 and PARP2 generate poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) chains on themselves and other substrates to promote DNA single-strand break repair (SSBR). PARP1 can be activated by diverse DNA lesions, whereas PARP2 specifically recognizes 5' phosphorylated nicks. They can be activated independently and provide mutual backup in the absence of the other. However, whether PARP1 and PARP2 have synergistic functions in DNA damage response remains elusive. Here, we show that PARP1 and the PAR chains generated by PARP1 recruit PARP2 to the vicinity of DNA damage sites through the scaffold protein XRCC1. Using quantitative live-cell imaging, we found that loss of XRCC1 markedly reduces irradiation-induced PARP2 foci in PARP1-proficient cells. The central BRCT domain (BRCT1) of XRCC1 binds to the PAR chain, while the C-terminal BRCT domain (BRCT2) of XRCC1 interacts with the catalytic domain of PARP2, facilitating its localization near the breaks. Together, these findings unveil a new function of XRCC1 in augmenting PARP2 recruitment in response to PARP1 activation and explain why PARP1, but not PARP2, is aggregated and hyperactivated in XRCC1-deficient cells.",

Although its role in the replication stress response is well defined, the mechanisms by which ATR supports normal cell proliferation remain elusive. Here, we show that ATR is dispensable for the viability of G0-arrested naïve B cells. However, upon cytokine-induced proliferation, Atr-deficient B cells initiate DNA replication efficiently, but by mid-S phase they display dNTP depletion, fork stalling, and replication failure. Nonetheless, productive DNA replication and dNTP levels can be restored in Atr-deficient cells by suppressing origin firing, such as partial inhibition of CDC7 and CDK1 kinase activities. Together, these findings indicate that ATR supports the proliferation of normal unstressed cells by tempering the pace of origin firing during the early S phase to avoid exhaustion of dNTPs and importantly also other replication factors.",

Ku70 and Ku80 heterodimer (KU) initiates NHEJ, thereby recruiting and activating the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). While DNA-PKcs deletion only moderately impairs end-ligation, the expression of kinase-dead DNA-PKcs completely abrogates NHEJ. Active DNA-PK phosphorylates DNA-PKcs at two clusters-PQR around S2056 (S2053 in mouse) and ABCDE around T2609.

        "Abstract": "The ATR kinase, which coordinates cellular responses to DNA replication stress, is also essential for the proliferation of normal unstressed cells. Although its role in the replication stress response is well defined, the mechanisms by which ATR supports normal cell proliferation remain elusive. Here, we show that ATR is dispensable for the viability of G0-arrested naïve B cells. However, upon cytokine-induced proliferation, Atr-deficient B cells initiate DNA replication efficiently in early S phase, but by mid-S phase they display dNTP depletion, fork stalling, and replication failure. Nonetheless, productive DNA replication can be restored in Atr-deficient cells by pathways that suppress origin firing, such as downregulation of CDC7 and CDK1 kinase activities. Together, these findings indicate that ATR supports the proliferation of normal unstressed cells by tempering the pace of origin firing during the early S phase to avoid exhaustion of dNTPs and other replication factors.",

        "Abstract": "PARP1 and PARP2 detect DNA breaks, which activates their catalytic production of poly(ADP-ribose) that recruits repair factors and contributes to PARP1/2 release from DNA. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are used in cancer treatment and target PARP1/2 catalytic activity, interfering with repair and increasing PARP1/2 persistence on DNA damage. In addition, certain PARPi exert allosteric effects that increase PARP1 retention on DNA. However, no clinical PARPi exhibit this allosteric behavior toward PARP1. In contrast, we show that certain clinical PARPi exhibit an allosteric effect that retains PARP2 on DNA breaks in a manner that depends on communication between the catalytic and DNA binding regions. Using a PARP2 mutant that mimics an allosteric inhibitor effect, we observed increased PARP2 retention at cellular damage sites. The PARPi AZD5305 also exhibited a clear reverse allosteric effect on PARP2. Our results can help explain the toxicity of clinical PARPi and suggest ways to improve PARPi moving forward.",

        "Abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) and 2 (PARP2) are two DNA damage-induced poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerases in cells and are the targets of PARP inhibitors used for cancer therapy. Strand breaks recruit and activate PARP1 and 2, which rapidly generate PAR from NAD+. PAR promotes the recruitment of other repair factors, relaxes chromatin, and has a role in DNA repair, transcription regulation, and RNA biology. Four PARP1/2 dual inhibitors are currently used to treat BRCA-deficient breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. In addition to blocking the enzymatic activity of PARP1 and 2, clinical PARP inhibitors extend the appearance of PARP1 and PARP2 on chromatin after damage, termed trapping. Loss of PARP1 confers resistance to PARP inhibitors, suggesting an essential role of trapping in cancer therapy. Yet, whether the persistent PARP1 and 2 foci at the DNA damage sites are caused by the retention of the same molecules or by the continual exchange of different molecules remains unknown. Here, we discuss recent results from quantitative live-cell imaging studies focusing on PARP1 and PARP2's distinct DNA substrate specificities and modes of recruitment and trapping with implications for cancer therapy and on-target toxicities of PARP inhibitors.",

        "Abstract": "Dual-inhibitors of PARP1 and PARP2 are promising anti-cancer drugs. In addition to blocking PARP1&2 enzymatic activity, PARP inhibitors also extend the lifetime of DNA damage-induced PARP1&2 foci, termed trapping. Trapping is important for the therapeutic effects of PARP inhibitors. Using live-cell imaging, we found that PARP inhibitors cause persistent PARP2 foci by switching the mode of PARP2 recruitment from a predominantly PARP1- and PAR-dependent rapid exchange to a WGR domain-mediated stalling of PARP2 on DNA. Specifically, PARP1-deletion markedly reduces but does not abolish PARP2 foci. The residual PARP2 foci in PARP1-deficient cells are DNA-dependent and abrogated by the R140A mutation in the WGR domain. Yet, PARP2-R140A forms normal foci in PARP1-proficient cells. In PARP1-deficient cells, PARP inhibitors - niraparib, talazoparib, and, to a lesser extent, olaparib - enhance PARP2 foci by preventing PARP2 exchange. This trapping of PARP2 is independent of auto-PARylation and is abolished by the R140A mutation in the WGR domain and the H415A mutation in the catalytic domain. Taken together, we found that PARP inhibitors trap PARP2 by physically stalling PARP2 on DNA via the WGR-DNA interaction while suppressing the PARP1- and PAR-dependent rapid exchange of PARP2.",

Most cancer-associated alterations to ATM are missense mutations at the PI3-kinase regulatory domain (PRD) or the kinase domain.

To understand how PRD suppresses lymphomagenesis, we introduced the cancer-associated PRD mutation R3008H (R3016 in mouse) into mice. R3008H abrogated DNA damage- and oxidative stress-induced activation of ATM without consistently affecting ATM protein stability and recruitment. In contrast to the early embryonic lethality of ",

        "Abstract": "To generate antibodies with different effector functions, B cells undergo Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR). The ligation step of CSR is usually mediated by the classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway. In cNHEJ-deficient cells, a remarkable ∼25% of CSR can be achieved by the alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway that preferentially uses microhomology (MH) at the junctions. While A-EJ-mediated repair of endonuclease-generated breaks requires DNA end resection, we show that CtIP-mediated DNA end resection is dispensable for A-EJ-mediated CSR using cNHEJ-deficient B cells. High-throughput sequencing analyses revealed that loss of ATM/ATR phosphorylation of CtIP at T855 or ATM kinase inhibition suppresses resection without altering the MH pattern of the A-EJ-mediated switch junctions. Moreover, we found that ATM kinase promotes Alt-EJ-mediated CSR by suppressing interchromosomal translocations independent of end resection. Finally, temporal analyses reveal that MHs are enriched in early internal deletions even in cNHEJ-proficient B cells. Thus, we propose that repetitive IgH switch regions represent favored substrates for MH-mediated end-joining contributing to the robustness and resection independence of A-EJ-mediated CSR.",

        "Abstract": "DNA breaks recruit and activate PARP1/2, which deposit poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) to recruit XRCC1-Ligase3 and other repair factors to promote DNA repair. Clinical PARP inhibitors (PARPi) extend the lifetime of damage-induced PARP1/2 foci, referred to as 'trapping'. To understand the molecular nature of 'trapping' in cells, we employed quantitative live-cell imaging and fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching. Unexpectedly, we found that PARP1 exchanges rapidly at DNA damage sites even in the presence of clinical PARPi, suggesting the persistent foci are not caused by physical stalling. Loss of Xrcc1, a major downstream effector of PAR, also caused persistent PARP1 foci without affecting PARP1 exchange. Thus, we propose that the persistent PARP1 foci are formed by different PARP1 molecules that are continuously recruited to and exchanging at DNA lesions due to attenuated XRCC1-LIG3 recruitment and delayed DNA repair. Moreover, mutation analyses of the NAD+ interacting residues of PARP1 showed that PARP1 can be physically trapped at DNA damage sites, and identified H862 as a potential regulator for PARP1 exchange. PARP1-H862D, but not PARylation-deficient PARP1-E988K, formed stable PARP1 foci upon activation. Together, these findings uncovered the nature of persistent PARP1 foci and identified NAD+ interacting residues involved in the PARP1 exchange.",

Naïve B cells undergo class switch recombination (CSR) to generate antibodies with different isotypes by joining two DNA double-strand breaks at different switching regions via the cNHEJ pathway. DNA-PK and the cNHEJ pathway play important roles in the DNA repair phase of CSR. To initiate cNHEJ, KU binds to DNA ends and recruits and activates DNA-PK. Activated DNA-PK phosphorylates DNA-PKcs at the S2056 and T2609 clusters.

        "Abstract": "Lymphocyte development requires ordered assembly and subsequent modifications of the antigen receptor genes through V(D)J recombination and Immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR), respectively. While the programmed DNA cleavage events are initiated by lymphocyte-specific factors, the resulting DNA double-strand break (DSB) intermediates activate the ATM kinase-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) and rely on the ubiquitously expressed classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway including the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and, in the case of CSR, also the alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway, for repair. Correspondingly, patients and animal models with cNHEJ or DDR defects develop distinct types of immunodeficiency reflecting their specific DNA repair deficiency. The unique end-structure, sequence context, and cell cycle regulation of V(D)J recombination and CSR also provide a valuable platform to study the mechanisms of, and the interplay between, cNHEJ and DDR. Here, we compare and contrast the genetic consequences of DNA repair defects in V(D)J recombination and CSR with a focus on the newly discovered cNHEJ factors and the kinase-dependent structural roles of ATM and DNA-PK in animal models. Throughout, we try to highlight the pending questions and emerging differences that will extend our understanding of cNHEJ and DDR in the context of primary immunodeficiency and lymphoid malignancies.",

To fill the need for a simple, user-friendly, and inexpensive dosimeter, we designed an innovative colorimetric nanosensor-based assay for detecting ionizing radiation. We show that hydroxyl radicals generated by ionizing radiation can be used to etch gold nanorods (AuNRs) and silver nanoprisms (AgNPRs), yielding reproducible color changes for radiation dose detection in the range of 50-2000 rad, broad enough to cover doses used in hyperfractionated, conventional, and hypofractionated radiotherapy. This range of doses detected by this assay correlates with radiation-induced DNA damage response in mammalian cells. Furthermore, this AuNR- and AgNPR-based sensing platform has been established in a paper format that can be readily adopted for a wide range of applications and translation.",

        "Abstract": "B cell development requires efficient proliferation and successful assembly and modifications of the immunoglobulin gene products. CtIP is an essential gene implicated in end resection and DNA repair. Here, we show that CtIP is essential for early B cell development but dispensable in naive B cells. CtIP loss is well tolerated in G1-arrested B cells and during V(D)J recombination, but in proliferating B cells, CtIP loss leads to a progressive cell death characterized by ATM hyperactivation, G2/M arrest, genomic instability, and 53BP1 nuclear body formation, indicating that the essential role of CtIP during proliferation underscores its stage-specific requirement in B cells. B cell proliferation requires phosphorylation of CtIP at T847 presumably by CDK, but not its interaction with CtBP or Rb or its nuclease activity. CtIP phosphorylation by ATM/ATR at T859 (T855 in mice) promotes end resection in G1-arrested cells but is dispensable for B cell development and class switch recombination, suggesting distinct roles for T859 and T847 phosphorylation in B cell development.",

        "Abstract": "The genome instability syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is caused by null mutations in the ATM gene, that lead to complete loss or inactivation of the gene's product, the ATM protein kinase. ATM is the primary mobilizer of the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) - a broad signaling network in which many components are ATM targets. The major clinical feature of A-T is cerebellar atrophy, characterized by relentless loss of Purkinje and granule cells. In Atm-knockout (Atm-KO) mice, complete loss of Atm leads to a very mild neurological phenotype, suggesting that Atm loss is not sufficient to markedly abrogate cerebellar structure and function in this organism.

        "Abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive chromosome breakage disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene. Typically, it presents in early childhood with progressive cerebellar dysfunction along with immunodeficiency and oculocutaneous telangiectasia. An increased risk of malignancy is also associated with the syndrome and, rarely, may be the presenting feature in small children. We describe a 17-year-old boy with slurred speech, mild motor delays and learning disability diagnosed with atypical A-T in the setting of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Suspicion for A-T was raised after review of a peripheral blood karyotype demonstrating rearrangements involving chromosomes 7 and/or 14. The diagnosis was confirmed after molecular testing identified a novel homozygous missense variant in ATM (c.5585T>A; p.Leu1862His) that resulted in protein instability and abolished serine/threonine protein kinase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of concurrent A-T and lymphoid malignancy diagnoses in an older child or adult with only mild neurological disease. Our experience suggests that screening for the disorder should be considered in any individual with lymphoid malignancy and neurological findings, especially as radiation and certain chemotherapy protocols are contraindicated in A-T.",

        "Abstract": "Missense mutations in ATM kinase, a master regulator of DNA damage responses, are found in many cancers, but their impact on ATM function and implications for cancer therapy are largely unknown. Here we report that 72% of cancer-associated ATM mutations are missense mutations that are enriched around the kinase domain. Expression of kinase-dead ATM (Atm(KD/-)) is more oncogenic than loss of ATM (Atm(-/-)) in mouse models, leading to earlier and more frequent lymphomas with Pten deletions. Kinase-dead ATM protein (Atm-KD), but not loss of ATM (Atm-null), prevents replication-dependent removal of Topo-isomerase I-DNA adducts at the step of strand cleavage, leading to severe genomic instability and hypersensitivity to Topo-isomerase I inhibitors. Correspondingly, Topo-isomerase I inhibitors effectively and preferentially eliminate Atm(KD/-), but not Atm-proficientor Atm(-/-) leukemia in animal models. These findings identify ATM kinase-domain missense mutations as a potent oncogenic event and a biomarker for Topo-isomerase I inhibitor based therapy.",

Here we report that heterozygous loss of Bcl11b (Bcl11b(+/-)) unexpectedly reduced lethal thymic lymphoma in ATM(-/-) mice by suppressing lymphoma progression, but not initiation.

        "Abstract": "Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a major DNA double-strand break repair pathway that is conserved in eukaryotes. In vertebrates, NHEJ further acquires end-processing capacities (e.g., hairpin opening) in addition to direct end-ligation. The catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) is a vertebrate-specific NHEJ factor that can be autophosphorylated or transphosphorylated by ATM kinase. Using a mouse model expressing a kinase-dead (KD) DNA-PKcs protein, we show that ATM-mediated transphosphorylation of DNA-PKcs regulates end-processing at the level of Artemis recruitment, while strict autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is necessary to relieve the physical blockage on end-ligation imposed by the DNA-PKcs protein itself. Accordingly, DNA-PKcs(KD/KD) mice and cells show severe end-ligation defects and p53- and Ku-dependent embryonic lethality, but open hairpin-sealed ends normally in the presence of ATM kinase activity. Together, our findings identify DNA-PKcs as the molecular switch that coordinates end-processing and end-ligation at the DNA ends through differential phosphorylations.",

        "Abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a protein kinase and a master regulator of DNA-damage responses. Germline ATM inactivation causes ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) syndrome with severe lymphocytopenia and greatly increased risk for T-cell lymphomas/leukemia. Both A-T and T-cell prolymphoblastic leukemia patients with somatic mutations of ATM frequently carry inv(14;14) between the T-cell receptor α/δ (TCRα/δ) and immunoglobulin H loci, but the molecular origin of this translocation remains elusive. ATM(-/-) mice recapitulate lymphocytopenia of A-T patients and routinely succumb to thymic lymphomas with t(12;14) translocation, syntenic to inv(14;14) in humans. Here we report that deletion of the TCRδ enhancer (Eδ), which initiates TCRδ rearrangement, significantly improves αβ T cell output and effectively prevents t(12;14) translocations in ATM(-/-) mice. These findings identify the genomic instability associated with V(D)J recombination at the TCRδ locus as the molecular origin of both lymphocytopenia and the signature t(12;14) translocations associated with ATM deficiency.",

        "Abstract": "XRCC4-like factor (XLF/Cernunnos) is a component of the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of double-strand DNA break repair. XLF-deficient patients develop a severe progressive lymphocytopenia. Although NHEJ is required for V(D)J recombination and lymphocyte development, XLF-deficient mice have normal V(D)J recombination, highlighting the need for an alternative mechanism for the lymphocytopenia. Here, we report that XLF-deficient mice recapitulate the age-dependent lymphocytopenia of patients. We show that XLF deficiency leads to premature aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), measured by decreased functional capacity in transplantation assays, preferential myeloid reconstitution, and reduced self-renewal at a young age. We propose that premature aging of HSCs, together with previously reported defects in class-switch recombination and memory immune response, underlies the progressive and severe lymphocytopenia in XLF-deficient patients in the absence of measurable V(D)J recombination defects.",

        "Abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is activated upon DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and phosphorylates numerous DSB response proteins, including histone H2AX on serine 139 (Ser-139) to form γ-H2AX. Through interaction with MDC1, γ-H2AX promotes DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR). H2AX Ser-139 can also be phosphorylated by DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit and ataxia telangiectasia- and Rad3-related kinase. Thus, we tested whether ATM functions in HR, particularly that controlled by γ-H2AX, by comparing HR occurring at the euchromatic ROSA26 locus between mouse embryonic stem cells lacking either ATM, H2AX, or both. We show here that loss of ATM does not impair HR, including H2AX-dependent HR, but confers sensitivity to inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. Loss of ATM or H2AX has independent contributions to cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation. The ATM-independent HR function of H2AX requires both Ser-139 phosphorylation and γ-H2AX/MDC1 interaction. Our data suggest that ATM is dispensable for HR, including that controlled by H2AX, in the context of euchromatin, excluding the implication of such an HR function in genomic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA damage, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition associated with ATM deficiency.",

A-T patients and mouse models that express no ATM protein undergo normal embryonic development but exhibit pleiotropic DNA repair defects. In this paper, we report that mice carrying homozygous kinase-dead mutations in Atm (Atm(KD/KD)) died during early embryonic development. Atm(KD/-) cells exhibited proliferation defects and genomic instability, especially chromatid breaks, at levels higher than Atm(-/-) cells. Despite this increased genomic instability, Atm(KD/-) lymphocytes progressed through variable, diversity, and joining recombination and immunoglobulin class switch recombination, two events requiring nonhomologous end joining, at levels comparable to Atm(-/-) lymphocytes. Together, these results reveal an essential function of ATM during embryogenesis and an important function of catalytically inactive ATM protein in DNA repair.",

        "Title": "Overlapping functions between XLF repair protein and 53BP1 DNA damage response factor in end joining and lymphocyte development.",
        "Abstract": "Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), a major pathway of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, is required during lymphocyte development to resolve the programmed DSBs generated during Variable, Diverse, and Joining [V(D)J] recombination. XRCC4-like factor (XLF) (also called Cernunnos or NHEJ1) is a unique component of the NHEJ pathway. Although germ-line mutations of other NHEJ factors abrogate lymphocyte development and lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), XLF mutations cause a progressive lymphocytopenia that is generally less severe than SCID. Accordingly, XLF-deficient murine lymphocytes show no measurable defects in V(D)J recombination. We reported earlier that ATM kinase and its substrate histone H2AX are both essential for V(D)J recombination in XLF-deficient lymphocytes, despite moderate role in V(D)J recombination in WT cells. p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is another substrate of ATM. 53BP1 deficiency led to small reduction of peripheral lymphocyte number by compromising both synapse and end-joining at modest level during V(D)J recombination. Here, we report that 53BP1/XLF double deficiency blocks lymphocyte development at early progenitor stages, owing to severe defects in end joining during chromosomal V(D)J recombination. The unrepaired DNA ends are rapidly degraded in 53BP1(-/-)XLF(-/-) cells, as reported for H2AX(-/-)XLF(-/-) cells, revealing an end protection role for 53BP1 reminiscent of H2AX. In contrast to the early embryonic lethality of H2AX(-/-)XLF(-/-) mice, 53BP1(-/-)XLF(-/-) mice are born alive and develop thymic lymphomas with translocations involving the T-cell receptor loci. Together, our findings identify a unique function for 53BP1 in end-joining and tumor suppression.",

        "Title": "Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein and DNA-dependent protein kinase have complementary V(D)J recombination functions.",
        "Abstract": "Antigen receptor variable region exons are assembled during lymphocyte development from variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments. Each germ-line gene segment is flanked by recombination signal sequences (RSs). Recombination-activating gene endonuclease initiates V(D)J recombination by cleaving a pair of gene segments at their junction with flanking RSs to generate covalently sealed (hairpinned) coding ends (CEs) and blunt 5'-phosphorylated RS ends (SEs). Subsequently, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) opens, processes, and fuses CEs to form coding joins (CJs) and precisely joins SEs to form signal joins (SJs). DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) activates Artemis endonuclease to open and process hairpinned CEs before their fusion into CJs by other NHEJ factors. Although DNA-PKcs is absolutely required for CJs, SJs are formed to variable degrees and with variable fidelity in different DNA-PKcs-deficient cell types. Thus, other factors may compensate for DNA-PKcs function in SJ formation. DNA-PKcs and the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase are members of the same family, and they share common substrates in the DNA damage response. Although ATM deficiency compromises chromosomal V(D)J CJ formation, it has no reported role in SJ formation in normal cells. Here, we report that DNA-PKcs and ATM have redundant functions in SJ formation. Thus, combined DNA-PKcs and ATM deficiency during V(D)J recombination leads to accumulation of unjoined SEs and lack of SJ fidelity. Moreover, treatment of DNA-PKcs- or ATM-deficient cells, respectively, with specific kinase inhibitors for ATM or DNA-PKcs recapitulates SJ defects, indicating that the overlapping V(D)J recombination functions of ATM and DNA-PKcs are mediated through their kinase activities.",

        "Title": "ATM damage response and XLF repair factor are functionally redundant in joining DNA breaks.",
        "Abstract": "Classical non-homologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) is a major mammalian DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair pathway. Deficiencies for classical NHEJ factors, such as XRCC4, abrogate lymphocyte development, owing to a strict requirement for classical NHEJ to join V(D)J recombination DSB intermediates. The XRCC4-like factor (XLF; also called NHEJ1) is mutated in certain immunodeficient human patients and has been implicated in classical NHEJ; however, XLF-deficient mice have relatively normal lymphocyte development and their lymphocytes support normal V(D)J recombination. The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein (ATM) detects DSBs and activates DSB responses by phosphorylating substrates including histone H2AX. However, ATM deficiency causes only modest V(D)J recombination and lymphocyte developmental defects, and H2AX deficiency does not have a measurable impact on these processes. Here we show that XLF, ATM and H2AX all have fundamental roles in processing and joining DNA ends during V(D)J recombination, but that these roles have been masked by unanticipated functional redundancies. Thus, combined deficiency of ATM and XLF nearly blocks mouse lymphocyte development due to an inability to process and join chromosomal V(D)J recombination DSB intermediates. Combined XLF and ATM deficiency also severely impairs classical NHEJ, but not alternative end-joining, during IgH class switch recombination. Redundant ATM and XLF functions in classical NHEJ are mediated by ATM kinase activity and are not required for extra-chromosomal V(D)J recombination, indicating a role for chromatin-associated ATM substrates. Correspondingly, conditional H2AX inactivation in XLF-deficient pro-B lines leads to V(D)J recombination defects associated with marked degradation of unjoined V(D)J ends, revealing that H2AX has a role in this process.",

        "Abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) deficiency predisposes humans and mice to T lineage lymphomas with recurrent chromosome 14 translocations involving the T cell receptor alpha/delta (Tcra/d) locus. Such translocations have been thought to result from aberrant repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during Tcra locus V(D)J recombination, and to require the Tcra enhancer (Ealpha) for Tcra rearrangement or expression of the translocated oncogene. We now show that, in addition to the known chromosome 14 translocation, ATM-deficient mouse thymic lymphomas routinely contain a centromeric fragment of chromosome 14 that spans up to the 5' boundary of the Tcra/d locus, at which position a 500-kb or larger region centromeric to Tcra/d is routinely amplified. In addition, they routinely contain a large deletion of the telomeric end of one copy of chromosome 12. In contrast to prior expectations, the recurrent translocations and amplifications involve V(D)J recombination-initiated breaks in the Tcrd locus, as opposed to the Tcra locus, and arise independently of the Ealpha. Overall, our studies reveal previously unexpected mechanisms that contribute to the oncogenic transformation of ATM-deficient T lineage cells.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in XLF/Cernunnos (XLF) cause lymphocytopenia in humans, and various studies suggest an XLF role in classical nonhomologous end joining (C-NHEJ). We now find that XLF-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts are ionizing radiation (IR) sensitive and severely impaired for ability to support V(D)J recombination. Yet mature lymphocyte numbers in XLF-deficient mice are only modestly decreased. Moreover, XLF-deficient pro-B lines, while IR-sensitive, perform V(D)J recombination at nearly wild-type levels. Correspondingly, XLF/p53-double-deficient mice are not markedly prone to the pro-B lymphomas that occur in previously characterized C-NHEJ/p53-deficient mice; however, like other C-NHEJ/p53-deficient mice, they still develop medulloblastomas. Despite nearly normal V(D)J recombination in developing B cells, XLF-deficient mature B cells are moderately defective for immunoglobulin heavy-chain class switch recombination. Together, our results implicate XLF as a C-NHEJ factor but also indicate that developing mouse lymphocytes harbor cell-type-specific factors/pathways that compensate for the absence of XLF function during V(D)J recombination.",

        "Abstract": "Upon DNA damage, histone H2AX is phosphorylated by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and other phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinases. To elucidate further the potential overlapping and unique functions of ATM and H2AX, we asked whether they have synergistic functions in the development and maintenance of genomic stability by inactivating both genes in mouse germ line. Combined ATM/H2AX deficiency caused embryonic lethality and dramatic cellular genomic instability. Mechanistically, severe genomic instability in the double-deficient cells is associated with a requirement for H2AX to repair oxidative DNA damage resulting from ATM deficiency. We discuss these findings in the context of synergies between ATM and other repair factors.",

        "Title": "Defective DNA repair and increased genomic instability in Cernunnos-XLF-deficient murine ES cells.",
        "Abstract": "Nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) is a major pathway of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in mammalian cells, and it functions to join both specifically programmed DSBs that occur in the context of V(D)J recombination during early lymphocyte development as well as general DSBs that occur in all cells. Thus, defects in NHEJ impair V(D)J recombination and lead to general genomic instability. In human patients, mutations of Cernunnos-XLF (also called NHEJ1), a recently identified NHEJ factor, underlie certain severe combined immune deficiencies associated with defective V(D)J recombination and radiosensitivity. To characterize Cernunnos-XLF function in mouse cells, we used gene-targeted mutation to delete exons 4 and 5 from both copies of the Cernunnos-XLF gene in ES cell (referred to as Cer(Delta/Delta) ES cells). Analyses of Cer(Delta/Delta) ES cells showed that they produce no readily detectable Cernunnos-XLF protein. Based on transient V(D)J recombination assays, we find that Cer(Delta/Delta) ES cells have dramatic impairments in ability to form both V(D)J coding joins and joins of their flanking recombination signal sequences (RS joins). Cer(Delta/Delta) ES cells are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation and have intrinsic DNA DSB repair defects as measured by pulse field gel electrophoresis. Finally, the Cernunnos-XLF mutations led to increased spontaneous genomic instability, including translocations. We conclude that, in mice, Cernunnos-XLF is essential for normal NHEJ-mediated repair of DNA DSBs and that Cernunnos-XLF acts as a genomic caretaker to prevent genomic instability.",

        "Abstract": "Histone H2AX promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR) in B-lymphocytes. CSR requires activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and involves joining of DSB intermediates by end joining. We find that AID-dependent IgH locus chromosome breaks occur at high frequency in primary H2AX-deficient B cells activated for CSR and that a substantial proportion of these breaks participate in chromosomal translocations. Moreover, activated B cells deficient for ATM, 53BP1, or MDC1, which interact with H2AX during the DSB response, show similarly increased IgH locus breaks and translocations. Thus, our findings implicate a general role for these factors in promoting end joining and thereby preventing DSBs from progressing into chromosomal breaks and translocations. As cellular p53 status does not markedly influence the frequency of such events, our results also have implications for how p53 and the DSB response machinery cooperate to suppress generation of lymphomas with oncogenic translocations.",

        "Abstract": "Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), an enzyme involved in branched-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation that is normally expressed at high levels in human liver, is specifically and consistently overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels in human prostate cancer and potentially other cancer types. To characterize the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of AMACR at the genetic and epigenetic levels, we performed a series of methylation and reporter assays in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. The results ruled out altered methylation patterns as the cause of overexpression in prostate cancer cells. However, promoter deletion analysis identified an 8-bp nonclassic CCAAT enhancer element located approximately 80 bp upstream of the transcriptional initiation site that is responsible for AMACR expression in both prostate cancer cell lines and cell lines of liver origin. Deletion or mutation of this element completely abolished AMACR promoter activity. Ectopic expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta increased luciferase activity driven by a wild-type AMACR promoter sequence but not by the sequence in which the putative CCAAT/enhancer binding protein binding element had been mutated. These results implicate a nonclassic CCAAT enhancer element in the AMACR gene promoter as playing a critical role in the regulation of AMACR gene expression.",

        "Abstract": "Overexpression of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), an enzyme involved in branched chain fatty acid beta-oxidation, in prostate cancer has been reported. Here, we report that an enzyme downstream from AMACR in the peroxisomal branched chain fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway-D-bifunctional protein (DBP)-is also upregulated in prostate cancer at both mRNA and protein levels, accompanied by increased enzymatic activity. Furthermore, our data suggest that pristanoyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX3), which is expressed at extremely low level in other human organs studied including the liver, might contribute significantly to peroxisomal branched chain fatty acid beta-oxidation in human prostate tissue and some prostate cancer cell lines. In contrast to these results for peroxisomal enzymes, no significant expression changes of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation enzymes were observed in prostate cancer tissues through comprehensive quantitative RT-PCR screening. These data for the first time provide evidence for the selective over-activation of peroxisomal branched chain fatty acid beta-oxidation in prostate cancer, emphasizing a new metabolic change during prostate oncogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Aspirin has been used to control pain and inflammation for over a century. Epidemiological studies first associated a decreased incidence of colorectal cancer with the long-term use of aspirin in the early 1980s. Near the same time the first reports showing regression of colorectal adenomas in response to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac were reported. In subsequent years, the use of other NSAIDs, which inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, was linked to reduced cancer risk in multiple tissues including those of the breast, prostate, and lung. Together these studies resulted in the identification of a new cancer preventive and/or therapeutic target-COX enzymes, especially COX-2. Meanwhile, the overexpression of COX-2, and less consistently, the upstream and downstream enzymes of the prostaglandin synthesis pathway, was demonstrated in multiple cancer types and some pre-neoplastic lesions. Direct interactions of prostaglandins with their receptors through autocrine or paracrine pathways to enhance cellular survival or stimulate angiogenesis have been proposed as the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-carcinogenic functions of COX-2. The rapid development of safe and effective inhibitors targeting individual COX enzymes not only dramatically improved our understanding of the function of COX-2, but also resulted in discovery of COX independent functions of NSAIDs, providing important hints for future drug design. Here we review the fundamental features of COX enzymes, especially as related to carcinogenesis, their expression and function in both animal tumor models and clinical cancers and the proposed mechanisms behind their roles in cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) is an enzyme involved in beta-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates. Recent work has identified AMACR as a new diagnostic marker for prostate cancer (PCa). The data from the present study suggest that AMACR is also functionally important for the growth of PCa cells. Overexpressed AMACR from both clinical tissues and PCa cell lines is wild type by sequence analysis and functionally active by enzymatic assay. Correspondingly, enzyme activity of AMACR increases approximately 4-fold in PCa in comparison with adjacent normal prostate. Small interference RNA (siRNA) against AMACR, but not the control inverted siRNA, reduced the expression of AMACR and significantly impaired proliferation of the androgen-responsive PCa cell line LAPC-4. No effect was observed in HeLaS3 cells, which express AMACR at a low level. Cell cycle analyses revealed a G(2)-M cell cycle arrest in LAPC-4 cells treated with siRNA compared with mock treatment or control inverted siRNA. Expression of a siRNA-resistant form of AMACR in LAPC-4 cells protects the cells from growth arrest after AMACR-specific siRNA treatment. Data from Western blotting and luciferase-based reporter assays suggest that the function and expression of AMACR are independent of androgen receptor-mediated signaling. Moreover, simultaneous inhibition of both the AMACR pathway by siRNA and androgen signaling by means of androgen withdrawal or antiandrogen suppressed the growth of LAPC-4 cells to a greater extent than either treatment alone. Taken together, these data suggest that AMACR is essential for optimal growth of PCa cells in vitro and that this enzyme has the potential to be a complementary target with androgen ablation in PCa treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Prostate cancer is among the most common malignancies. It is estimated that 1 in 6 men in the United States will be diagnosed with this disease. Despite the high prevalence and importance of prostate cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression remain poorly understood. This article reviews new information about the roles of oxidants and electrophiles in prostate cancer; the potential importance of chronic inflammation and atrophy in prostate carcinogenesis, and implications for chemoprevention; evidence supporting telomere shortening and genetic instability in the etiology of prostate cancer; and alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase (AMACR) as a potential marker for prostate carcinogenesis. These new results show that at least some high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PIN) and early adenocarcinomas appear to arise from proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA). Inflammation and other environmental factors may lead to the destruction of prostate epithelial cells, and increased proliferation may occur as a response to this cell death. Such proliferation may be mechanistically related to decreased p27(Kip1) observed in PIA. The decreased apoptosis associated with these events may also be related to increased expression of Bcl-2. Increased oxidant and electrophile stress in the setting of increased proliferation associated with these events may lead to elevated glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) expression as a genomic-protective measure. However, aberrant methylation of the CpG island of the GSTP1 gene promoter silences GSTP1 gene expression and protein levels, setting the stage for additional genetic damage and accelerated progression toward PIN and carcinoma. Additional results show that AMACR may be an important new marker of prostate cancer, and its use in combination with p63 staining may provide the basis for an improved method for identification of prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Identification of genes that are dysregulated in association with prostate carcinogenesis can provide disease markers and clues relevant to disease etiology. Of particular interest as candidate markers of disease are those genes that are frequently overexpressed. In this study, we describe a gene, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), whose expression is consistently up-regulated in prostate cancer. Analysis of mRNA levels of AMACR revealed an average up-regulation of approximately 9 fold in clinical prostate cancer specimens compared with normal. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis confirms the up-regulation at the protein level and localizes the enzyme predominantly to the peroxisomal compartment of prostate cancer cells. A detailed immunohistochemical analysis of samples from 168 primary prostate cancer cases using both standard slides and tissue microarrays demonstrates that both prostate carcinomas and the presumed precursor lesion (high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) consistently scored significantly higher than matched normal prostate epithelium; 88% of the carcinomas had a staining score higher than the highest score observed for any sample of normal prostate epithelium. Both untreated metastases (n = 32 patients) and hormone refractory prostate cancers (n = 14 patients) were generally strongly positive for AMACR. To extend the utility of this marker for prostate cancer diagnosis, we combined staining for cytoplasmic AMACR with staining for the nuclear protein, p63, a basal cell marker in the prostate that is absent in prostate cancer. In a simple assay that can be useful for the diagnosis of prostate cancer on both biopsy and surgical specimens, combined staining for p63 and AMACR resulted in a staining pattern that greatly facilitated the identification of malignant prostate cells. The enzyme encoded by the AMACR gene plays a critical role in peroxisomal beta oxidation of branched chain fatty acid molecules. These observations could have important epidemiological and preventive implications for prostate cancer, as the main sources of branched chain fatty acids are dairy products and beef, the consumption of which has been associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer in multiple studies. On the basis of its consistency and magnitude of cancer cell-specific expression, we propose AMACR as an important new marker of prostate cancer and that its use in combination with p63 staining will form the basis for an improved staining method for the identification of prostate carcinomas. Furthermore, the absence of AMACR staining in the vast majority of normal tissues coupled with its enzymatic activity makes AMACR the ideal candidate for development of molecular probes for the noninvasive identification of prostate cancer by imaging modalities.",
