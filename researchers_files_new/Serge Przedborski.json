        "Title": "The Role of Alpha-Synuclein in Synucleinopathy: Impact on Lipid Regulation at Mitochondria-ER Membranes.",
        "Abstract": "The protein alpha-synuclein (αSyn) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathy, which includes Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, and mounting evidence suggests that lipid dyshomeostasis is a critical phenotype in these neurodegenerative conditions. Previously, we identified that αSyn localizes to mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs), temporary functional domains containing proteins that regulate lipid metabolism, including the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylserine. In the present study, we have analyzed the lipid composition of postmortem human samples, focusing on the substantia nigra pars compacta of Parkinson's disease and controls, as well as three less affected brain regions of Parkinson's donors. To further assess synucleinopathy-related lipidome alterations, similar analyses were performed on the striatum of multiple system atrophy cases. Our data show region-and disease-specific changes in the levels of lipid species. Specifically, our data revealed alterations in the levels of specific phosphatidylserine species in brain areas most affected in Parkinson's disease. Some of these alterations, albeit to a lesser degree, are also observed multiples system atrophy. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, we show that αSyn contributes to regulating phosphatidylserine metabolism at MAM domains, and that αSyn dosage parallels the perturbation in phosphatidylserine levels. Our results support the notion that αSyn pathophysiology is linked to the dysregulation of lipid homeostasis, which may contribute to the vulnerability of specific brain regions in synucleinopathy. These findings have significant therapeutic implications.",

Over the past decades, thanks to intense investigations performed in both in vivo and in vitro models of ALS, major progress has been made toward gaining insights into the pathobiology of this incurable, fatal disorder. Among these advances is the growing recognition that non-neuronal cells participate in the degeneration of MNs in ALS, which could transform our understanding of the neurobiology of disease and the ability to devise effective disease-modifying therapies. In this review, we examine the contribution of non-cell-autonomous processes to the pathogenesis of ALS, with a focus on glial cells and in particular on astrocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Cell-to-cell communications are critical determinants of pathophysiological phenotypes, but methodologies for their systematic elucidation are lacking. Herein, we propose an approach for the Systematic Elucidation and Assessment of Regulatory Cell-to-cell Interaction Networks (SEARCHIN) to identify ligand-mediated interactions between distinct cellular compartments. To test this approach, we selected a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in which astrocytes expressing mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (mutSOD1) kill wild-type motor neurons (MNs) by an unknown mechanism. Our integrative analysis that combines proteomics and regulatory network analysis infers the interaction between astrocyte-released amyloid precursor protein (APP) and death receptor-6 (DR6) on MNs as the top predicted ligand-receptor pair. The inferred deleterious role of APP and DR6 is confirmed in vitro in models of ALS. Moreover, the DR6 knockdown in MNs of transgenic mutSOD1 mice attenuates the ALS-like phenotype. Our results support the usefulness of integrative, systems biology approach to gain insights into complex neurobiological disease processes as in ALS and posit that the proposed methodology is not restricted to this biological context and could be used in a variety of other non-cell-autonomous communication mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Maintaining a pool of functional mitochondria requires degradation of damaged ones within the cell. PINK1 is critical in this quality-control process: loss of mitochondrial membrane potential causes PINK1 to accumulate on the mitochondrial surface, triggering mitophagy. However, little is known about how PINK1 is regulated. Recently, we showed that PINK1 content is kept low in healthy mitochondria by continuous ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of its mature form via a mechanism inconsistent with the proposed N-end rule process. Using both human female and monkey cell lines, we now demonstrate that once generated within the mitochondria, 52 kDa PINK1 adopts a mitochondrial topology most consistent with it being at the mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interface. From this particular submitochondrial location, PINK1 interacts with components of the ER-associated degradation pathway, such as the E3 ligases gp78 and HRD1, which cooperate to catalyze PINK1 ubiquitination. The valosin-containing protein and its cofactor, UFD1, then target ubiquitinated PINK1 for proteasomal degradation. Our data show that PINK1 in healthy mitochondria is negatively regulated via an interplay between mitochondria and ER, and shed light on how this mitochondrial protein gains access to the proteasome.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial respiratory deficiencies have been observed in numerous neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. For decades, these reductions in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) have been presumed to trigger an overall bioenergetic crisis in the neuron, resulting in cell death. While the connection between respiratory defects and neuronal death has never been proven, this hypothesis has been supported by the detection of nonspecific mitochondrial DNA mutations in these disorders. These findings led to the notion that mitochondrial respiratory defects could be initiators of these common neurodegenerative disorders, instead of being consequences of a prior insult, a theory we believe to be misconstrued. Herein, we review the roots of this mitochondrial hypothesis and offer a new perspective wherein mitochondria are analyzed not only from the OxPhos point of view, but also as a complex organelle residing at the epicenter of many metabolic pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Along with Parkin, PINK1 plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. Although PINK1 is expressed constitutively, its level is kept low in healthy mitochondria by polyubiquitination and ensuing proteasomal degradation of its mature, 52 kDa, form. We show here that the target of PINK1 polyubiquitination is the mature form and is mediated by ubiquitination of a conserved lysine at position 137. Notably, the full-length protein also contains Lys-137 but is not ubiquitinated. On the basis of our data, we propose that cleavage of full-length PINK1 at Phe-104 disrupts the major hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain in the protein, inducing a conformation change in the resultant mature form that exposes Lys-137 to the cytosol for subsequent modification by the ubiquitination machinery. Thus, the balance between the full-length and mature PINK1 allows its levels to be regulated via ubiquitination of the mature form and ensures that PINK1 functions as a mitochondrial quality control factor.",

The current focus in neurodegeneration has been on individual genes and pathways. In contrast, we assembled a genome-wide regulatory model (henceforth, \"interactome\"), whose unbiased interrogation revealed 23 candidate causal master regulators of neurodegeneration in an in vitro model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), characterized by a loss of spinal motor neurons (MNs). Of these, eight were confirmed as specific MN death drivers in our model of familial ALS, including NF-κB, which has long been considered a pro-survival factor. Through an extensive array of molecular, pharmacological, and biochemical approaches, we have confirmed that neuronal NF-κB drives the degeneration of MNs in both familial and sporadic models of ALS, thus providing proof of principle that regulatory network analysis is a valuable tool for studying cell-specific mechanisms of neurodegeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Familial cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be associated with overexpression or mutation of α-synuclein, a synaptic protein reported to be localized mainly in the cytosol and mitochondria. We recently showed that wild-type α-synuclein is not present in mitochondria, as previously thought, but rather is located in mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Remarkably, we also found that PD-related mutated α-synuclein results in its reduced association with mitochondria-associated membranes, coincident with a lower degree of apposition of endoplasmic reticulum with mitochondria and an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation, as compared with wild-type. This new subcellular localization of α-synuclein raises fundamental questions regarding the relationship of α-synuclein to mitochondria-associated membranes function, in both normal and pathological states. In this article, we attempt to relate aspects of PD pathogenesis to what is known about mitochondria-associated membranes' behavior and function. We hypothesize that early events occurring in dopaminergic neurons at the level of the mitochondria-associated membranes could cause long-term disturbances that lead to PD.",

        "Abstract": "α-synuclein (α-syn) is one of the genes that when mutated or overexpressed causes Parkinson's Disease (PD). Initially, it was described as a synaptic terminal protein and later was found to be localized at mitochondria. Mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) have emerged as a central endoplasmic reticulum (ER) subcellular compartments where key functions of the cell occur. These domains, enriched in cholesterol and anionic phospholipids, are where calcium homeostasis, lipid transfer, and cholesterol metabolism are regulated. Some proteins, related to mitochondrial dynamics and function, are also localized to this area. Several neurodegenerative diseases have shown alterations in MAM functions and resident proteins, including Charcot Marie-Tooth and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have recently reported that MAM function is downregulated in cell and mouse models of PD expressing pathogenic mutations of α-syn. This review focuses on the possible role of α-syn in these cellular domains and the early pathogenic features of PD that could be explained by α-syn-MAM disturbances.",

        "Title": "Parkinson's disease: animal models and dopaminergic cell vulnerability.",
        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects about 1.5% of the global population over 65 years of age. A hallmark feature of PD is the degeneration of the dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the consequent striatal DA deficiency. Yet, the pathogenesis of PD remains unclear. Despite tremendous growth in recent years in our knowledge of the molecular basis of PD and the molecular pathways of cell death, important questions remain, such as: (1) why are SNc cells especially vulnerable; (2) which mechanisms underlie progressive SNc cell loss; and (3) what do Lewy bodies or α-synuclein reveal about disease progression. Understanding the variable vulnerability of the dopaminergic neurons from the midbrain and the mechanisms whereby pathology becomes widespread are some of the primary objectives of research in PD. Animal models are the best tools to study the pathogenesis of PD. The identification of PD-related genes has led to the development of genetic PD models as an alternative to the classical toxin-based ones, but does the dopaminergic neuronal loss in actual animal models adequately recapitulate that of the human disease? The selection of a particular animal model is very important for the specific goals of the different experiments. In this review, we provide a summary of our current knowledge about the different in vivo models of PD that are used in relation to the vulnerability of the dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain in the pathogenesis of PD.",

        "Abstract": "To explore the link between bioenergetics and motor neuron degeneration, we used a computational model in which detailed morphology and ion conductance are paired with intracellular ATP production and consumption. We found that reduced ATP availability increases the metabolic cost of a single action potential and disrupts K+/Na+ homeostasis, resulting in a chronic depolarization. The magnitude of the ATP shortage at which this ionic instability occurs depends on the morphology and intrinsic conductance characteristic of the neuron. If ATP shortage is confined to the distal part of the axon, the ensuing local ionic instability eventually spreads to the whole neuron and involves fasciculation-like spiking events. A shortage of ATP also causes a rise in intracellular calcium. Our modeling work supports the notion that mitochondrial dysfunction can account for salient features of the paralytic disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, including motor neuron hyperexcitability, fasciculation, and differential vulnerability of motor neuron subpopulations.",

        "Abstract": "Most cases of neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic, hindering the use of genetic mouse models to analyze disease mechanisms. Focusing on the motor neuron (MN) disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we therefore devised a fully humanized coculture model composed of human adult primary sporadic ALS (sALS) astrocytes and human embryonic stem-cell-derived MNs. The model reproduces the cardinal features of human ALS: sALS astrocytes, but not those from control patients, trigger selective death of MNs. The mechanisms underlying this non-cell-autonomous toxicity were investigated in both astrocytes and MNs. Although causal in familial ALS (fALS), SOD1 does not contribute to the toxicity of sALS astrocytes. Death of MNs triggered by either sALS or fALS astrocytes occurs through necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis involving receptor-interacting protein 1 and the mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein. The necroptotic pathway therefore constitutes a potential therapeutic target for this incurable disease.",

        "Abstract": "Familial Parkinson disease is associated with mutations in α-synuclein (α-syn), a presynaptic protein that has been localized not only to the cytosol, but also to mitochondria. We report here that wild-type α-syn from cell lines, and brain tissue from humans and mice, is present not in mitochondria but rather in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM), a structurally and functionally distinct subdomain of the ER. Remarkably, we found that pathogenic point mutations in human α-syn result in its reduced association with MAM, coincident with a lower degree of apposition of ER with mitochondria, a decrease in MAM function, and an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation compared with wild-type. Although overexpression of wild-type α-syn in mutant α-syn-expressing cells reverted the fragmentation phenotype, neither overexpression of the mitochondrial fusion/MAM-tethering protein MFN2 nor inhibition/ablation of the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1 was able to do so, implying that α-syn operates downstream of the mitochondrial fusion/fission machinery. These novel results indicate that wild-type α-syn localizes to the MAM and modulates mitochondrial morphology, and that these behaviors are impaired by pathogenic mutations in α-syn. We believe that our results have far-reaching implications for both our understanding of α-syn biology and the treatment of synucleinopathies.",

        "Abstract": "PINK1 is a mitochondrial kinase proposed to have a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease through the regulation of mitophagy. Here, we show that the PINK1 main cleavage product, PINK152, after being generated inside mitochondria, can exit these organelles and localize to the cytosol, where it is not only destined for degradation by the proteasome but binds to Parkin. The interaction of cytosolic PINK1 with Parkin represses Parkin translocation to the mitochondria and subsequent mitophagy. Our work therefore highlights the existence of two cellular pools of PINK1 that have different effects on Parkin translocation and mitophagy.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder whose pathogenesis remains essentially unknown. Currently, it is believed that the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease is a combination of both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. Proposed cell-autonomous mechanisms include alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics, dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, and impaired turnover of mitochondria. As for the proposed non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, they involve prion-like behavior of misfolded proteins and neuroinflammation. This suggests that cell death in Parkinson's disease is caused by a multifactorial cascade of pathogenic events and argues that effective neuroprotective therapy for Parkinson's disease may have to rely on multiple drug interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Pathologically, it is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Although most occurrences have an unknown cause, several gene mutations have been linked to familial forms of PD. The discovery of some of the proteins encoded by these genes, including Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1, at the mitochondria offered a new perspective on the involvement of mitochondria in PD. Specifically, these proteins are thought to be involved in the maintenance of a healthy pool of mitochondria by regulating their turnover by mitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy. In this review, we discuss recent studies on the role of mitophagy in PD. We present three putative models whereby PINK1 and Parkin may affect mitophagy; 1) by shifting the balance between fusion and fission of the mitochondrial network, 2) by modulating mitochondrial motility and 3) by directly recruiting the autophagic machinery to damaged mitochondria.

        "Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, adult-onset neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons. Recent studies have made it clear that although motor neurons are the primary targets of the degenerative process, other cell types play key roles in the death of motor neurons. Most notably, cells of the immune system, including astrocytes and microglia have come under increasing scrutiny, after multiple lines of evidence have shown these cells to be deleterious to motor neurons. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that astrocytes and microglia containing mutated SOD1 are harmful to motor neurons. Several studies on ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases have revealed that reactive astrocytes and microglia are capable of releasing pro-inflammatory factors such as cytokines and chemokines, which are harmful to neighboring neurons. In addition, it is believed that diseased astrocytes can specifically kill motor neurons through the release of toxic factors. Furthermore, in an animal model of the disease, it has been shown that the reduction of SOD1 in microglia may be able to slow the progression of ALS symptoms. Although the exact pathways of motor neuron death in ALS have yet to be elucidated, studies have suggested that they die through aBax-dependent signaling pathway. Mounting evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays an important role in the degeneration of motor neurons. Based on these findings, anti-inflammatory compounds are currently being tested for their potential to reduce disease severity; however, these studies are only in the preliminary stages. While we understand that astrocytes and microglia play a role in the death of motor neurons in ALS, much work needs to be done to fully understand ALS pathology and the role the immune system plays in disease onset and progression.",

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease of an aging population, and although there have been several significant findings about the PD disease process, much of this process still remains a mystery. Breakthroughs in the last two decades using animal models have offered insights into the understanding of the PD disease process, its etiology, pathology, and molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, while cellular models have helped to identify specific events, animal models, both toxic and genetic, have replicated almost all of the hallmarks of PD and are useful for testing new neuroprotective or neurorestorative strategies. Moreover, significant advances in the modeling of additional PD features have come to light in both classic and newer models. In this review, we try to provide an updated summary of the main characteristics of these models as well as the strengths and weaknesses of what we believe to be the most popular PD animal models. These models include those produced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropiridine (MPTP), rotenone, and paraquat, as well as several genetic models like those related to alpha-synuclein, PINK1, Parkin and LRRK2 alterations.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the emergence of autophagy as a key process for mitochondrial quality control, the existence and persistence of pathogenic mtDNA mutations in human disease suggests that the degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria does not occur widely in vivo. During macroautophagy, a double-membraned cup-shaped structure engulfs cytosolic content. This autophagic vesicle then fuses with lysosomes, allowing hydrolytic enzymes to degrade the contents. Mitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy, is thought to degrade damaged or nonfunctioning mitochondria specifically. The Parkinson disease-related proteins PINK1 (a mitochondrially localized kinase) and PARK2 (PARKIN, a cytosolically-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase) are essential for targeting mitochondria for mitophagy. Upon chemical uncoupling of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψ(m)), PINK1 located in the mitochondrial outer membrane recruits PARK2 from the cytosol to the mitochondria, followed by delivery of the organelle to the autophagic machinery for degradation.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), a rapidly fatal motor neuron disease. Mutant SOD1 has pleiotropic toxic effects on motor neurons, among which mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as one of the contributing factors in motor neuron demise. Mitochondria are highly dynamic in neurons; they are constantly reshaped by fusion and move along neurites to localize at sites of high-energy utilization, such as synapses. The finding of abnormal mitochondria accumulation in neuromuscular junctions, where the SOD1-FALS degenerative process is though to initiate, suggests that impaired mitochondrial dynamics in motor neurons may be involved in pathogenesis. We addressed this hypothesis by live imaging microscopy of photo-switchable fluorescent mitoDendra in transgenic rat motor neurons expressing mutant or wild-type human SOD1. We demonstrate that mutant SOD1 motor neurons have impaired mitochondrial fusion in axons and cell bodies. Mitochondria also display selective impairment of retrograde axonal transport, with reduced frequency and velocity of movements. Fusion and transport defects are associated with smaller mitochondrial size, decreased mitochondrial density, and defective mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, mislocalization of mitochondria at synapses among motor neurons, in vitro, correlates with abnormal synaptic number, structure, and function. Dynamics abnormalities are specific to mutant SOD1 motor neuron mitochondria, since they are absent in wild-type SOD1 motor neurons, they do not involve other organelles, and they are not found in cortical neurons. Together, these results suggest that impaired mitochondrial dynamics may contribute to the selective degeneration of motor neurons in SOD1-FALS.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) accompanied by a buildup of proteinaceous aggregates termed Lewy bodies (LB). In addition to protein aggregation and the loss of DA signaling, PD is also characterized by an active immune response. T-cell infiltration accompanies activated microglial and astrocytic accumulation in and around the SNpc. Although potentially beneficial, microglial activation is most likely responsible for furthering disease pathology and DA neuron degeneration through the release of harmful substances such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxidative species and reactive nitrogen species. Activation of the NF-κB death pathway has been shown to occur following microglial activation related release of Cox-2, IL-1β, and Toll-like receptor activation, resulting in increased degeneration of DA neurons of the SNpc. Blockade of microglial activation can lead to DA neuron protection in animal models of PD; however, clinical application of anti-inflammatory drugs has not yielded similar benefits. Future therapeutic designs must take into account the multifactorial nature of PD, including the varied roles of the adaptive and innate immune responses.",

To this end, a number of animal models are in use. These models parallel our thinking about the etiology of PD. Thus, herein, we discuss the most popular neurotoxin animal models, 6-hydroxydopamine and MPTP as one school of thought believes that PD is the result of a toxic insult. Since several researchers think that pesticide and herbicide use can increase the risk of developing PD, we review some of the aspects of rotenone and paraquat in rodents. Furthermore, now that we know that 10% of all PD cases are genetic in nature, we discuss some of the more common genetic rodent models of PD. None of the above models captures all of the hallmarks of PD. Thus, a given model should never be used indiscriminately to investigate every question, but should instead be carefully selected on the basis of being the most suitable model for the question being asked.",

        "Abstract": "Adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders are disabling and often fatal diseases of the nervous system whose underlying mechanisms of cell death remain unknown. Defects in mitochondrial respiration had previously been proposed to contribute to the occurrence of many, if not all, of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. However, the discovery of genes mutated in hereditary forms of these enigmatic diseases has additionally suggested defects in mitochondrial dynamics. Such disturbances can lead to changes in mitochondrial trafficking, in interorganellar communication, and in mitochondrial quality control. These new mechanisms by which mitochondria may also be linked to neurodegeneration will likely have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder whose cardinal manifestations are due primarily to a profound deficit in brain dopamine. Since the 1980s, several therapeutic strategies have been discovered to treat the symptoms of this neurological disorder, but as of yet, none halts or retards the neurodegenerative process. In an attempt to shed light on the neurobiology of Parkinson's disease, a number of experimental models have been developed, especially during the last 25 years. They come essentially in 3 flavors: pharmacological (eg, reserpine), toxic (eg, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), and genetic (eg, transgenic synuclein mice). These models can also be recast as etiologic, pathogenic, and symptomatic/pathophysiologic, as each may contribute to our understanding of the cause, the mechanisms, and the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this review, we will discuss the question of Parkinson's disease models, starting from the period when this journal was born to today. During this journey of 25 years, we will discuss both the significant contributions of the Parkinson's disease models and hurdles that remain to be overcome to one day cure this neurological disease.",

Some familial forms of PD are provoked by mutations in the genes encoding for the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog)-induced putative kinase-1 (PINK1) and Parkin. Mounting evidence indicates that PINK1 and Parkin might function in concert to modulate mitochondrial degradation, termed mitophagy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PINK1/Parkin affect mitophagy are just beginning to be elucidated. Herein, we review the main advances in our understanding of the PINK1/Parkin pathway. Because of the phenotypic similarities among the different forms of PD, a better understanding of PINK1/Parkin biology might have far-reaching pathogenic and therapeutic implications for both the inherited and the sporadic forms of PD.",

        "Abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases represent a growing public health challenge. Current medications treat symptoms, but none halt or retard neurodegeneration. The recent advent of pluripotent cell biology has opened new avenues for neurodegenerative disease research. The greatest potential for induced pluripotent cells derived from affected individuals is likely to be their utility for modeling and understanding the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative processes, and for searching for new treatments, including cell replacement therapies. However, much work remains to be done before pluripotent cells can be used for preclinical and clinical applications. Here we discuss the challenges of generating specific neural cell subtypes from pluripotent stem cells, the use of pluripotent stem cells to model both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration, whether adult-onset neurodegeneration can be emulated in short-term cultures and the hurdles of cell replacement therapy. Progress in these four areas will substantially accelerate effective application of pluripotent stem cells.",

Among these genes, those that code for PTEN-induced kinase-1 (PINK1) ( 2) and for the E3-ubiquitin ligase Parkin ( 3) did attract major interest from mitochondriologists, in part, because both proteins interact with each other and apparently function, genetically, within the same molecular pathway to modulate mitochondrial dynamics in Drosophila.

        "Abstract": "Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and PARK2/Parkin mutations cause autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson's disease. Upon a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in human cells, cytosolic Parkin has been reported to be recruited to mitochondria, which is followed by a stimulation of mitochondrial autophagy. Here, we show that the relocation of Parkin to mitochondria induced by a collapse of DeltaPsi(m) relies on PINK1 expression and that overexpression of WT but not of mutated PINK1 causes Parkin translocation to mitochondria, even in cells with normal DeltaPsi(m). We also show that once at the mitochondria, Parkin is in close proximity to PINK1, but we find no evidence that Parkin catalyzes PINK1 ubiquitination or that PINK1 phosphorylates Parkin. However, co-overexpression of Parkin and PINK1 collapses the normal tubular mitochondrial network into mitochondrial aggregates and/or large perinuclear clusters, many of which are surrounded by autophagic vacuoles. Our results suggest that Parkin, together with PINK1, modulates mitochondrial trafficking, especially to the perinuclear region, a subcellular area associated with autophagy. Thus by impairing this process, mutations in either Parkin or PINK1 may alter mitochondrial turnover which, in turn, may cause the accumulation of defective mitochondria and, ultimately, neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "DNA damage is a proposed pathogenic factor in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease. To probe the underpinning mechanism of such neuronal perturbation, we sought to produce an experimental model of DNA damage. We thus first assessed DNA damage by in situ nick translation and emulsion autoradiography in the mouse brain after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 4 x 20 mg/kg, ip, every 2 h), a neurotoxin known to produce a model of Parkinson disease. Here we show that DNA strand breaks occur in vivo in this mouse model of Parkinson disease with kinetics and a topography that parallel the degeneration of substantia nigra neurons, as assessed by FluoroJade labeling. Previously, nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) were found to modulate MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal death. We thus assessed the contribution of these enzymes to DNA damage in mice lacking neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), or Cox-2. We found that the lack of Cox-2 and nNOS activities but not of iNOS activity attenuated MPTP-related DNA damage. We also found that not only nuclear, but also mitochondrial, DNA is a target for the MPTP insult. These results suggest that the loss of genomic integrity can be triggered by the concerted actions of nNOS and Cox-2 and provide further support to the view that DNA damage may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson disease.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. Typically PD is a sporadic neurological disorder, and over time affected patients see their disability growing and their quality of life declining. Oxidative stress has been hypothesized to be linked to both the initiation and the progression of PD. Preclinical findings from both in vitro and in vivo experimental models of PD suggest that the neurodegenerative process starts with otherwise healthy neurons being hit by some etiological factors, which sets into motion a cascade of deleterious events. In these models initial molecular alterations in degenerating dopaminergic neurons include increased formation of reactive oxygen species, presumably originating from both inside and outside the mitochondria. In the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD, time-course experiments suggest that oxidative stress is an early event that may directly kill some of the dopaminergic neurons. In this model it seems that oxidative stress may play a greater role in the demise of dopaminergic neurons indirectly by activating intracellular, cell death-related, molecular pathways. As the neurodegenerative process evolves in the MPTP mouse model, indices of neuroinflammation develop, such as microglial activation. The latter increases the level of oxidative stress to which the neighboring compromised neurons are subjected to, thereby promoting their demise. However, these experimental studies have also shown that oxidative stress is not the sole deleterious factor implicated in the death of dopaminergic neurons. Should a similar multifactorial cascade underlie dopaminergic neuron degeneration in PD, then the optimal therapy for this disease may have to rely on a cocktail of agents, each targeting a different critical component of this hypothesized pathogenic cascade. If correct, this may be a reason why neuroprotective trials using a single agent, such as an antioxidant, have thus far generated disappointing results.",

Efforts in deducing the PINK1 signaling pathway have been hindered by controversy around its subcellular and submitochondrial localization and the authenticity of its reported substrates. We show here that this mitochondrial protein exhibits a topology in which the kinase domain faces the cytoplasm and the N-terminal tail is inside the mitochondria. Although deletion of the transmembrane domain disrupts this topology, common PD-linked PINK1 mutations do not. These results are critical in rectifying the location and orientation of PINK1 in mitochondria, and they should help decipher its normal physiological function and potential pathogenic role in PD.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) cause a form of the fatal paralytic disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), presumably by a combination of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous processes. Here, we show that expression of mutated human SOD1 in primary mouse spinal motor neurons does not provoke motor neuron degeneration. Conversely, rodent astrocytes expressing mutated SOD1 kill spinal primary and embryonic mouse stem cell-derived motor neurons. This is triggered by soluble toxic factor(s) through a Bax-dependent mechanism. However, mutant astrocytes do not cause the death of spinal GABAergic or dorsal root ganglion neurons or of embryonic stem cell-derived interneurons. In contrast to astrocytes, fibroblasts, microglia, cortical neurons and myocytes expressing mutated SOD1 do not cause overt neurotoxicity. These findings indicate that astrocytes may play a role in the specific degeneration of spinal motor neurons in ALS. Identification of the astrocyte-derived soluble factor(s) may have far-reaching implications for ALS from both a pathogenic and therapeutic standpoint.",

        "Abstract": "ALS is a fatal paralytic disorder characterized by a progressive loss of spinal cord motor neurons. Herein, we show that NADPH oxidase, the main reactive oxygen species-producing enzyme during inflammation, is activated in spinal cords of ALS patients and in spinal cords in a genetic animal model of this disease. We demonstrate that inactivation of NADPH oxidase in ALS mice delays neurodegeneration and extends survival. We also show that NADPH oxidase-derived oxidant products damage proteins such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptors, which are located on motor neurons. Our in vivo and in vitro data indicate that such an oxidative modification hinders the IGF1/Akt survival pathway in motor neurons. These findings suggest a non-cell-autonomous mechanism through which inflammation could hasten motor neuron death and contribute to the selective motor neuronal degeneration in ALS.",

Accumulation of misfolded mutant SOD1 might activate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways. Here we show that transgenic mice expressing ALS-linked SOD1 mutants exhibit molecular alterations indicative of a recruitment of ER's signaling machinery. We demonstrate by biochemical and morphological methods that mutant SOD1 accumulates inside the ER, where it forms insoluble high molecular weight species and interacts with the ER chaperone immunoglobulin-binding protein. These alterations are age- and region-specific, because they develop over the course of the disease and occur in the affected spinal cord but not in the nonaffected cerebellum in transgenic mutant SOD1 mice. Our results suggest a toxic mechanism for mutant SOD1 by which this ubiquitously expressed pathogenic protein could affect motor neuron survival and contribute to the selective motor neuronal degeneration in ALS.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that appears essentially as a sporadic condition. It results mainly from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. PD etiology remains mysterious, whereas its pathogenesis begins to be understood as a multifactorial cascade of deleterious factors. Most insights into PD pathogenesis come from investigations performed in experimental models of PD, especially those produced by neurotoxins. Although a host of natural and synthetic molecules do exert deleterious effects on dopaminergic neurons, only a handful are used in living laboratory animals to recapitulate some of the hallmarks of PD. In this review, we discuss what we believe are the four most popular parkinsonian neurotoxins, namely 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rotenone, and paraquat. The main goal is to provide an updated summary of the main characteristics of each of these four neurotoxins. However, we also try to provide the reader with an idea about the various strengths and the weaknesses of these neurotoxic models.",

Inflammatory oxidants have emerged as key contributors to PD- and MPTP-related neurodegeneration. Here, we show that myeloperoxidase (MPO), a key oxidant-producing enzyme during inflammation, is upregulated in the ventral midbrain of human PD and MPTP mice. We also show that ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons of mutant mice deficient in MPO are more resistant to MPTP-induced cytotoxicity than their wild-type littermates. Supporting the oxidative damaging role of MPO in this PD model are the demonstrations that MPO-specific biomarkers 3-chlorotyrosine and hypochlorous acid-modified proteins increase in the brains of MPTP-injected mice. This study demonstrates that MPO participates in the MPTP neurotoxic process and suggests that inhibitors of MPO may provide a protective benefit in PD.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease whose etiology and pathogenesis remain mainly unknown. To investigate its cause and, more particularly, its mechanism of neuronal death, numerous in vivo experimental models have been developed. Currently, both genetic and toxic models of PD are available, but the use of neurotoxins such as 6-hydroxydopamine, paraquat, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, and rotenone are still the most popular means for modeling the destruction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons seen in PD. These four neurotoxins, although distinct in their intimate cytotoxic mechanisms, kill dopaminergic neurons via a cascade of deleterious events that consistently involves oxidative stress. Herein, we review and compare the molecular mechanisms of 6-hydroxydopamine, paraquat, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine, and rotenone, placing the emphasis of our discussion on how reactive oxygen and nitrogen species contribute to the neurotoxic properties of these four molecules. As the reader will discover, to achieve the above stated goal, we had to not only appraise recent findings, but also revisit earlier landmark studies to provide a comprehensive view on this topic. This approach also enabled us to describe how our understanding of the mechanism of actions of certain toxins has evolved over time, which is particularly striking in the case of the quatrogenarian neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine.",

Its etiology remains enigmatic while its pathogenesis begins to be understood as a multifactorial cascade of deleterious factors. As of yet, most insights into PD pathogenesis are derived from toxic models of PD and show that the earlier cellular perturbations arising in dopaminergic neurons include oxidative stress and energy crisis. These alterations, rather than killing neurons, trigger subsequent death-related molecular pathways including elements of apoptosis. The fate of dopaminergic neurons in PD may also be influenced by additional factors such as excitotoxicity, emanating from the increased glutamatergic input from the subthalamic nucleus to the substantia nigra, and the glial response that arises in the striatum and the substantia nigra. In rare instances, PD can be familial, and those genetic forms have also provided clues to the pathogenesis of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron death including abnormalities in the mechanisms of protein folding and degradation as well as mitochondrial function. Although more remains to be elucidated about the pathogenic cascade in PD, the compilation of all of the aforementioned alterations starts to shed light on why and how nigral dopaminergic neurons may degenerate in this prominent disease, that is PD.",

Two recent publications of alpha-synuclein-duplication mutations show that the severity of familial Parkinsonian phenotype is dependent upon SNCA gene dosage and corresponding protein levels. Familial point mutations in SNCA were found to impair the efficient lysosomal degradation of alpha-synuclein, potentially resulting in elevated levels of alpha-synuclein. Conversely, the complete knockout of SNCA has little effect on transgenic mice. It is now clear that the regulation of alpha-synuclein levels has potential significance in the pathogenesis and treatment of sporadic PD.",

        "Abstract": "The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) impairs mitochondrial respiration and damages dopaminergic neurons as seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we report that L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type II/amyloid binding alcohol dehydrogenase (HADH II/ABAD), a mitochondrial oxidoreductase enzyme involved in neuronal survival, is downregulated in PD patients and in MPTP-intoxicated mice. We also show that transgenic mice with increased expression of human HADH II/ABAD are significantly more resistant to MPTP than their wild-type littermates. This effect appears to be mediated by overexpression of HADH II/ABAD mitigating MPTP-induced impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. This study demonstrates that HADH II/ABAD modulates MPTP neurotoxicity and suggests that HADH II/ABAD mimetics may provide protective benefit in the treatment of PD.",

Here we show that the infusion of the ketone body d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB) in mice confers partial protection against dopaminergic neurodegeneration and motor deficits induced by MPTP. These effects appear to be mediated by a complex II-dependent mechanism that leads to improved mitochondrial respiration and ATP production.

Current PD medications treat symptoms; none halt or retard dopaminergic neuron degeneration. The main obstacle to developing neuroprotective therapies is a limited understanding of the key molecular events that provoke neurodegeneration. The discovery of PD genes has led to the hypothesis that misfolding of proteins and dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are pivotal to PD pathogenesis. Previously implicated culprits in PD neurodegeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, may also act in part by causing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, in addition to producing other deleterious events in dopaminergic neurons. Neurotoxin-based models (particularly MPTP) have been important in elucidating the molecular cascade of cell death in dopaminergic neurons. PD models based on the manipulation of PD genes should prove valuable in elucidating important aspects of the disease, such as selective vulnerability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons to the degenerative process.",

Evidence for the participation of oxidative processes in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease have been obtained in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model by the use of genetically altered mice. MPTP administration has been shown to increase levels of superoxide both intracellularly, via the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and other mechanisms and extracellularly, via the activation of NADPH-oxidase in microglia. In addition to superoxide, nitric oxide production by nNOS or by microglial iNOS also contributes to the MPTP neurotoxocity. Mice with endowed defences against superoxide or with deficiency in the nNOS and iNOS are protected from MPTP toxicity suggesting that formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates both intracellularly and extracellularly contributes to the demise of dopaminergic neurons. Similar contribution of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species may well underlie the neurodegenerative processes in Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Experimental models of dopaminergic neurodegeneration play a critical role in our quest to elucidate the cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the recent development of \"genetic models\" that have followed upon the discovery of mutations causing rare forms of familial PD, toxic models remain at the forefront when it comes to exploring the pathogenesis of sporadic PD. Among these, the model produced by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has a competitive advantage over all other toxic models because once this neurotoxin causes intoxication, it induces in humans a syndrome virtually identical to PD. For the past two decades, the complex pharmacology of MPTP and the key steps in the MPTP neurotoxic process have been identified. These molecular events can be classified into three groups: First, those implicated in the initiation of toxicity, which include energy failure due to ATP depletion and oxidative stress mediated by superoxide and nitric oxide; second, those recruited subsequently in response to the initial neuronal perturbations, which include elements of the molecular pathways of apoptosis such as Bax; and, third, those amplifying the neurodegenerative insult, which include various proinflammatory factors such as prostaglandins. Herein, these different contributing factors are reviewed, as is the sequence in which it is believed these factors are acting within the cascade of events responsible for the death of dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP model and in PD. How to target these factors to devise effective neuroprotective therapies for PD is also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of uncertain pathogenesis characterized by a loss of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons, and can be modeled by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Both inflammatory processes and oxidative stress may contribute to MPTP- and PD-related neurodegeneration. However, whether inflammation may cause oxidative damage in MPTP and PD is unknown. Here we show that NADPH-oxidase, the main reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing enzyme during inflammation, is up-regulated in SNpc of human PD and MPTP mice. These changes coincide with the local production of ROS, microglial activation, and DA neuronal loss seen after MPTP injections. Mutant mice defective in NADPH-oxidase exhibit less SNpc DA neuronal loss and protein oxidation than their WT littermates after MPTP injections. We show that extracellular ROS are a main determinant in inflammation-mediated DA neurotoxicity in the MPTP model of PD. This study supports a critical role for NADPH-oxidase in the pathogenesis of PD and suggests that targeting this enzyme or enhancing extracellular antioxidants may provide novel therapies for PD.",

Increased expression of cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) and production of prostaglandin E(2) have been implicated in neurodegeneration in several pathological settings. Here we show that COX-2, the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin E(2) synthesis, is up-regulated in brain dopaminergic neurons of both PD and MPTP mice. COX-2 induction occurs through a JNKc-Jun-dependent mechanism after MPTP administration. We demonstrate that targeting COX-2 does not protect against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration by mitigating inflammation. Instead, we provide evidence that COX-2 inhibition prevents the formation of the oxidant species dopamine-quinone, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This study supports a critical role for COX-2 in both the pathogenesis and selectivity of the PD neurodegenerative process. Because of the safety record of the COX-2 inhibitors, and their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, these drugs may be therapies for PD.",

        "Abstract": "MPTP causes damage to substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons as seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). After sys-temic administration of MPTP, its active metabolite, MPP +, accumulates within SNpc DA neurons, where it inhibits ATP production and stim-ulates superoxide radical formation. The produced superoxide radicals react with nitric oxide (NO) to produce peroxynitrite, a highly reactive tissue-damaging species that damages proteins by oxidation and nitration. Only selected proteins appear nitrated, and among these, is found tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in DA synthesis. The process of nitration inactivates TH and, consequently dopamine pro-duction. Peroxynitrite also nicks DNA, which, in turn, activates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP activation consumes ATP, and thus acutely depletes cell energy stores. This latter event aggravates the preexisting energy failure due to MPP + -induced mitochondrial respira-tion blockade and precipitates cell death. Altogether, these findings support the view that MPTP's deleterious cascade of events include mito-chondrial respiration deficit, oxidative stress, and energy failure. Because of the similarity between the MPTP mouse model and PD, it is tempting to propose that a similar scenario applies to the pathogenesis of PD.",

The loss of these neurons is associated with a glial response composed mainly of activated microglial cells and, to a lesser extent, of reactive astrocytes. This glial response may be the source of trophic factors and can protect against reactive oxygen species and glutamate. Alternatively, this glial response can also mediate a variety of deleterious events related to the production of pro-oxidant reactive species, and pro-inflammatory prostaglandin and cytokines. We discuss the potential protective and deleterious effects of glial cells in the SNpc of PD and examine how those factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.",

        "Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease in adults. Despite several genetic breakthroughs, the actual cause and mechanism of neurodegeneration in ALS remains a mystery. Nevertheless, recent scientific and clinical advances have led to the development of new therapeutic strategies for this progressive, fatal disorder. We review the progress of the most recent clinical trials in ALS, taking into account some of the hurdles encountered by these studies. We also discuss the potential role of retroviral infection as a cause or contributor to ALS, which is one of the most recent hypotheses for the pathogenesis of the disease. The genetic background of ALS is summarized and special attention is given to the newly identified ALS gene ALS2, and to those that are currently being investigated. The last part of this review is dedicated to the mutation in superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1). The hypothesized deleterious mechanisms of mutant SOD1 are discussed, as well as the possibilities that the mutant protein activates the apoptotic cell death process and that these molecular alterations can be exploited to devise experimental neuroprotective therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The loss of these neurons is associated with a glial response composed mainly of activated microglial cells and, to a lesser extent, of reactive astrocytes. This glial response may be the source of trophic factors and can protect against reactive oxygen species and glutamate. Alternatively, this glial response can also mediate a variety of deleterious events related to the production of pro-oxidant reactive species, proinflammatory prostaglandin, and cytokines. In this review, the authors discuss the potential protective and deleterious effects of glial cells in the SNpc of PD and examine how these factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.",

        "Abstract": "Transgenic expression of mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) produces an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. We have previously shown that the mitochondrial-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) pathway, including the redistribution of Bax, the cytosolic release of cytochrome c, and the activation of caspase-9, is recruited during neurodegeneration in spinal cords of transgenic mutant SOD1 mice. Herein, we show that the pro-PCD protein Bid is highly expressed in spinal cords of both wild-type and transgenic mutant SOD1 mice. While full-length Bid is found in the spinal cord of the two groups of mice, its cleaved form is only seen in transgenic mutant SOD1 mice, as early as the beginning of symptoms. In contrast, activated caspase-8, which is known to cleave Bid, is detected only at the end-stage of the disease. We also found that the expression of a dominant negative mutant of caspase-1 attenuates Bid cleavage as well as the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and the ensuing activation of caspase-9 and -3 in spinal cords of transgenic mutant SOD1 mice. These findings suggest that Bid cleavage may occur in this model by a pathway other than caspase-8 and shed light onto the molecular correlates of the previously reported beneficial effect of caspase-1 inhibition in transgenic mutant SOD1 mice.",

        "Abstract": "1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) damages the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway as seen in Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disorder with no effective protective treatment. Consistent with a role of glial cells in PD neurodegeneration, here we show that minocycline, an approved tetracycline derivative that inhibits microglial activation independently of its antimicrobial properties, mitigates both the demise of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and the formation of nitrotyrosine produced by MPTP. In addition, we show that minocycline not only prevents MPTP-induced activation of microglia but also the formation of mature interleukin-1beta and the activation of NADPH-oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), three key microglial-derived cytotoxic mediators. Previously, we demonstrated that ablation of iNOS attenuates MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. Now, we demonstrate that iNOS is not the only microglial-related culprit implicated in MPTP-induced toxicity because mutant iNOS-deficient mice treated with minocycline are more resistant to this neurotoxin than iNOS-deficient mice not treated with minocycline. This study demonstrates that microglial-related inflammatory events play a significant role in the MPTP neurotoxic process and suggests that minocycline may be a valuable neuroprotective agent for the treatment of PD.",
