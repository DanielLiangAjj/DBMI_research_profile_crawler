        "Title": "Lysine methylation modifications in tumor immunomodulation and immunotherapy: regulatory mechanisms and perspectives.",
        "Abstract": "Lysine methylation is a crucial post-translational modification (PTM) that significantly impacts gene expression regulation. This modification not only influences cancer development directly but also has significant implications for the immune system. Lysine methylation modulates immune cell functions and shapes the anti-tumor immune response, highlighting its dual role in both tumor progression and immune regulation. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the intrinsic role of lysine methylation in the activation and function of immune cells, detailing how these modifications affect cellular processes and signaling pathways. We delve into the mechanisms by which lysine methylation contributes to tumor immune evasion, allowing cancer cells to escape immune surveillance and thrive. Furthermore, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting lysine methylation in cancer immunotherapy. Emerging strategies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, are being explored for their efficacy in modulating lysine methylation to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. By targeting these modifications, we can potentially improve the effectiveness of existing treatments and develop novel therapeutic approaches to combat cancer more effectively.",

Cuproptosis is a recently proposed method of cell death in 2022, and it is different from any previously reported method. The principle is that copper ions lead to aggregation and instability of intracellular proteins. An increasing number of researchers are dedicated to enriching the mechanism of cuproptosis and exploring its relationship with cancer. Studies have found that intracellular copper levels have an impact on the occurrence and development of lymphoma. The complexity of lymphoma and the limitations of treatment necessitate in-depth studies of the disease. We will review the mechanism of cuproptosis and its potential in lymphoma therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is characterized by rapid onset and high chance of metastasis. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets is imperative. E26 transformation-specific homologous factor (EHF), a member of the E26 transformation-specific transcription factor family, plays a pivotal role in epithelial cell differentiation and cancer progression. However, its precise role in CCA remains unclear. In this study, through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that EHF plays a profound role in promoting CCA by transcriptional activation of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1). Moreover, EHF significantly recruited and activated tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the C-C motif chemokine 2/C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCL2/CCR2) axis, thereby remodeling the tumor microenvironment. In human CCA tissues, EHF expression was positively correlated with GLI1 and CCL2 expression, and patients with co-expression of EHF/GLI1 or EHF/CCL2 had the most adverse prognosis. Furthermore, the combination of the GLI1 inhibitor, GANT58, and CCR2 inhibitor, INCB3344, substantially reduced the occurrence of EHF-mediated CCA. In summary, our findings suggest that EHF is a potential prognostic biomarker for patients with CCA, while also advocating the therapeutic approach of combined targeting of GLI1 and CCL2/CCR2-TAMs to inhibit EHF-driven CCA development.",

        "Title": "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancer: therapeutic targets to overcome tumor immune evasion.",
        "Abstract": "Paradoxically, tumor development and progression can be inhibited and promoted by the immune system. After three stages of immune editing, namely, elimination, homeostasis and escape, tumor cells are no longer restricted by immune surveillance and thus develop into clinical tumors. The mechanisms of immune escape include abnormalities in antitumor-associated immune cells, selection for immune resistance to tumor cells, impaired transport of T cells, and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. A population of distinct immature myeloid cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), mediate immune escape primarily by exerting immunosuppressive effects and participating in the constitution of an immunosuppressive microtumor environment. Clinical trials have found that the levels of MDSCs in the peripheral blood of cancer patients are strongly correlated with tumor stage, metastasis and prognosis. Moreover, animal experiments have confirmed that elimination of MDSCs inhibits tumor growth and metastasis to some extent. Therefore, MDSCs may become the target of immunotherapy for many cancers, and eliminating MDSCs can help improve the response rate to cancer treatment and patient survival. However, a clear definition of MDSCs and the specific mechanism involved in immune escape are lacking. In this paper, we review the role of the MDSCs population in tumor development and the mechanisms involved in immune escape in different tumor contexts. In addition, we discuss the use of these cells as targets for tumor immunotherapy. This review not only contributes to a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the essential role of MDSCs in immune system reactions against tumors but also provides information to guide the development of cancer therapies targeting MDSCs.",

        "Abstract": "The use of biochar for soil improvement and emission reduction has been widely recognized for its excellent performance. However, the choice of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature for biochar production significantly affects its surface parameters and interactions with soil substances. In this study, we retrieved 465 peer-reviewed papers on the application of biochar in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient losses in soil and analyzed the changes in biochar physicochemical parameters from different feedstock and pyrolytic temperatures. Molecular simulation computing technology was also used to explore the impacts of these changes on the interaction between biochar and soil substances. The statistical results from the peer-reviewed papers indicated that biochar derived from wood-based feedstock exhibits superior physical characteristics, such as increased porosity and specific surface area. Conversely, biochar derived from straw-based feedstock was found to contain excellent element content, such as O, N, and H, and biochar derived from straw and produced at low pyrolysis temperatures contains a significant number of functional groups that enhance the charge transfer potential and adsorption stability by increasing surface charge density, charge distribution and bonding orbitals. However, it should be noted that this enhancement may also activate certain recalcitrant C compounds and promote biochar decomposition. Taken together, these results have significant implications for biochar practitioners when selecting suitable feedstock and pyrolysis temperatures based on agricultural needs and increasing their understanding of the interaction mechanism between biochar and soil substances.",

        "Abstract": "Deterioration of neurovascular conditions can be rapid in patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and often lead to poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is crucial to promptly assess and continually track the progression of the disease. This study incorporated baseline clinical conditions, repeatedly measured neurological grades and haematological biomarkers for dynamic outcome prediction in patients with spontaneous SAH. Neurological intervention, mainly aneurysm clipping and endovascular embolisation, was also incorporated as an intermediate event in developing a neurological intervention transition (NIT) joint model. A retrospective cohort study was performed on 701 patients in spontaneous SAH with a study period of 14 days from the MIMIC-IV dataset. A dynamic prognostic model predicting outcome of patients was developed based on combination of Cox model and piecewise linear mixed-effect models to incorporate different types of prognostic information. Clinical baseline covariates, including cerebral oedema, cerebral infarction, respiratory failure, hydrocephalus and vasospasm, as well as repeated measured Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), glucose and white blood cell (WBC) levels were covariates contributing to the optimal model. Incorporation of neurological intervention as an intermediate event increases the prediction performance compared with baseline joint modelling approach. The average AUC of the optimal model proposed in this study is 0.7783 across different starting points of prediction and prediction intervals. The model proposed in this study can provide dynamic prognosis for spontaneous SAH patients and significant potential benefits in critical care management.",

        "Title": "Total Lipid Extracts of Honeybee Drone Larvae Are Modulated by Extraction Temperature and Display Consistent Anti-Inflammatory Potential.",
        "Abstract": "Honeybee drone larvae are male bees that develop from unfertilized eggs and play a role in colony reproduction. The nutritional value of honeybee drone larvae is due to their high protein, lipid, and other nutrient contents, making them a profitable food source for humans in some cultures. Drone larvae lipids (DLLs) contribute to drone development; however, few studies have explored their substantial compositions and bioactive functions. In this study, we carried out DLL lipidomics analysis using UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS prior to in vitro anti-inflammatory activity analysis. The results highlighted the importance of the extraction temperature on the DLL composition. A total of 21 lipids were found in the DLL extract, mostly categorized into five groups: nine phospholipids, three sphingolipids, two neutral lipids, one plant glycoglycerolipid, four lipid acyl, and others. Drying extraction at -20 °C produced more sphingolipids, phospholipids, and unsaturated fatty acids. Of 37 fatty acids, 18 were displayed at -20 °C degrees, as shown by GC-MS quantitative analysis. Myristic (246.99 ± 13.19 μg/g), palmitic (1707.87 ± 60.53 μg/g), stearic (852.32 ± 24.17 μg/g), and oleic (2463.03 ± 149.61 μg/g) acids were the predominant fatty acids. Furthermore, we examined the significant in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of DLL (-20 °C) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged RAW264.7 cells. Nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen (ROS) production and mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-10, COX-2, and iNOS were significantly decreased, demonstrating the anti-inflammatory function of DLL. Overall, this study provided insight into the lipid composition of DLL, revealed the influence of temperature, and explored the functionality of DLL (-20 °C), allowing for further application of DLLs as functional foods.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive human malignancies worldwide. However, the molecular mechanism of HCC metastasis is largely unknown. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a key role in gene regulation, and dysregulation of lncRNA is critical to cancer metastasis. LINC01980 has been reported in ESCC recently, but the mechanism underlying its function in HCC is still unknown. In this study, we found that LINC01980 was upregulated and associated with notably poor overall survival in HCC patients. Functionally, LINC01980 played a carcinogenic role and promoted HCC metastasis. Mechanically, LINC01980 enhanced the E2F5 expression via competitively binding miR-376b-5p, thereby inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promoting HCC cells migration and invasion. In addition, LINC01980-mediated HCC cells metastasis was dependent on E2F5. What's more, TGF-β activated LINC01980 transcription through the canonical TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway in HCC. In conclusion, LINC01980, activated by the canonical TGF-β/SMAD pathway, promoted HCC metastasis via miR-376b-5p/E2F5 axis. Therefore, LINC01980 might be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of HCC.",

Here, the fabricating process-electrochemical property correlation of laser-scribed graphene (LSG) devices was discussed emphatically and a pertinent optimization was performed to achieve better electroanalytical performance. Experiment results indicated that the laser scribing technique possessed great process latitude and reducing laser power and scribing speed facilitated fabricating high-quality graphene electrodes. Benefiting from its binder-free 3D porous network structure and high active/geometric area ratio, the optimized LSG electrode was superior to the screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) on electrochemical performance in the [Fe(CN)",

        "Abstract": "3,4-bis(3-nitrofurazan-4-yl)furoxan (DNTF) is a new energetic compound with high energy and high density, and it is an important component of propellant and melt cast explosive. In order to study the effect of solvent on the growth morphology of DNTF, the growth plane of DNTF in vacuum is predicted by attachment energy (AE) model, and then the modified attachment energy of each growth plane in different solvents is calculated by molecular dynamics simulation. The morphology of crystal in solvent is predicted by modified attachment energy (MAE) model. The factors affecting crystal growth in solvent environment are analyzed by mass density distribution, radial distribution function and diffusion coefficient. The results show that the growth morphology of crystal in solvent is not only related to the adsorption strength of solvent to crystal plane, but affected by the attraction of crystal plane to solute. The hydrogen bond plays an important role in the adsorption strength between solvent and crystal plane. The polarity of solvent has a great influence on the crystal morphology, and the interaction between the solvent with stronger polarity and the crystal plane is stronger. The morphology of DNTF in n-butanol solvent is closer to spherical, which can effectively reduce the sensitivity of DNTF.",

        "Abstract": "Photoperiod is an important environmental cue interacting with circadian clock pathway to optimize the local adaption and yield of crops. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) in family Amaranthaceae has been known as superfood due to the nutritious elements. As quinoa was originated from the low-latitude Andes, most of the quinoa accessions are short-day type. Short-day type quinoa usually displays altered growth and yield status when introduced into higher latitude regions. Thus, deciphering the photoperiodic regulation on circadian clock pathway will help breed adaptable and high yielding quinoa cultivars.",

        "Abstract": "As a momentous energetic group, a nitro group widely exists in high-energy-density materials (HEDMs), such as trinitrotoluene (TNT), 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB), cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylene-2,4,6-trinitramine (RDX), etc. The nitro group has a significant effect on improving the oxygen balance and detonation performances of energetic materials (EMs). Moreover, the nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and it can increase the acidity of the acidic hydrogen-containing nitrogen-rich energetic compounds to facilitate the construction of energetic ionic salts. Thus, it is possible to design nitro-nitrogen-rich energetic compounds with adjustable properties. In this paper, the nitration methods of azoles, including imidazole, pyrazole, triazole, tetrazole, and oxadiazole, as well as azines, including pyrazine, pyridazine, triazine, and tetrazine, have been concluded. Furthermore, the prospect of the future development of nitrogen-rich heterocyclic energetic compounds has been stated, so as to provide references for researchers who are engaged in the synthesis of EMs.",

        "Abstract": "Over the last 25 years, inhibition of Janus kinases (JAKs) has been pursued as a modality for treating various immune and inflammatory disorders. While the clinical development of JAK inhibitors (jakinibs) began with the investigation of their use in allogeneic transplantation, their widest successful application came in autoimmune and allergic diseases. Multiple molecules have now been approved for diseases ranging from rheumatoid and juvenile arthritis to ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis, graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and other inflammatory pathologies in 80 countries around the world. Moreover, two jakinibs have also shown surprising efficacy in the treatment of hospitalized coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients, indicating additional roles for jakinibs in infectious diseases, cytokine storms and other hyperinflammatory syndromes. Jakinibs, as a class of pharmaceutics, continue to expand in clinical applications and with the development of more selective JAK-targeting and organ-selective delivery. Importantly, jakinib safety and pharmacokinetics have been investigated alongside clinical development, further cementing the potential benefits and limits of jakinib use. This review covers jakinibs that are approved or are under late phase investigation, focusing on clinical applications, pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, and future opportunities and challenges.",

        "Abstract": "The four Janus kinase (JAK) proteins and seven signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factors mediate intracellular signal transduction downstream of cytokine receptors, which are implicated in the pathology of autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory diseases. Development of targeted small-molecule therapies such as JAK inhibitors, which have varied selective inhibitory profiles, has enabled a paradigm shift in the treatment of diverse disorders. JAK inhibitors suppress intracellular signalling mediated by multiple cytokines involved in the pathological processes of rheumatoid arthritis and many other immune and inflammatory diseases, and therefore have the capacity to target multiple aspects of those diseases. In addition to rheumatoid arthritis, JAK inhibition has potential for treatment of autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and alopecia areata, in which stimulation of innate immunity activates adaptive immunity, leading to generation of autoreactive T cells and activation and differentiation of B cells. JAK inhibitors are also effective in the treatment of allergic disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, and can even be used for the COVID-19-related cytokine storm. Mechanism-based treatments targeting JAK-STAT pathways have the potential to provide positive outcomes by minimizing the use of glucocorticoids and/or non-specific immunosuppressants in the treatment of systemic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, Virtual Reality (VR) Head-Mounted Displays (HMD) have been used to provide an immersive, first-person view in real-time for the remote-control of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV). One critical issue is that it is challenging to perceive the distance of obstacles surrounding the vehicle from 2D views in the HMD, which deteriorates the control of UGV. Conventional distance indicators used in HMD take up screen space which leads clutter on the display and can further reduce situation awareness of the physical environment. To address the issue, in this paper we propose off-screen in-device feedback using vibro-tactile and/or light-visual cues to provide real-time distance information for the remote control of UGV. Results from a study show a significantly better performance with either feedback type, reduced workload and improved usability in a driving task that requires continuous perception of the distance between the UGV and its environmental objects or obstacles. Our findings show a solid case for in-device vibro-tactile and/or light-visual feedback to support remote operation of UGVs that highly relies on distance perception of objects.",

The field of JAK-STAT biology, particularly its clinical relevance, continues to be shaped by 2 important advances. First, the increased use of genomic sequencing has led to the discovery of novel clinical syndromes caused by mutations in JAK and STAT genes. This has provided insights regarding the consequences of aberrant JAK-STAT signaling for immunity, lymphoproliferation, and malignancy. In addition, since the approval of ruxolitinib and tofacitinib, the therapeutic use of JAK inhibitors (jakinibs) has expanded to include a large spectrum of diseases. Efficacy and safety data from over a decade of clinical studies have provided additional mechanistic insights while improving the care of patients with inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. This review discusses major advances in the field, focusing on updates in genetic diseases and in studies of clinical jakinibs in human disease.",

        "Abstract": "The secretory carrier-associated membrane proteins (SCAMPs) are associated with the development of multiple human cancers. The role of SCAMPs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, remains to be identified. In the present study, we explored expression patterns and prognostic value of SCAMPs and network analysis of SCAMPs-related signaling pathways in AML using Oncomine, GEPIA, cBioPortal, LinkedOmics, DAVID and Metascape databases. Genetic alteration analysis revealed that the mutation rate of SCAMP genes was below 1% (9/1272) in AML, and there was no significant correlation between SCAMPs gene mutation and AML prognosis. However, the SCAMP2/5 mRNA levels were significantly higher in AML patients than in healthy controls. Moreover, high mRNA expressions of SCAMP2/4/5 were associated with poor overall survival, which might be due to that SCAMP2/4/5 and their co-expressed genes were associated with multiple pathways related to tumorigenesis and progression, including human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection, acute myeloid leukemia, mTOR and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. These results suggest that SCAMP2/4/5 are potential prognostic markers for AML, and that SCAMP2 and SCAMP5 individually or in combination may be used as diagnostic markers for AML.",

        "Title": "Autophagy-Related Gene Pairs Signature for the Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.",
        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been recognized as the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There is increasing evidence that the abnormal expression of autophagy-related genes plays an important role in the occurrence and development of HCC. Therefore, the study of autophagy-related genes can further elucidate the genetic drivers of cancer and provide valuable therapeutic targets for clinical treatment. In this study, we used 232 autophagy-related genes extracted from the Human Autophagy Database (HADb) and Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to construct 1884 autophagy-related gene pairs. On this basis, we developed a prognostic model based on autophagy-related gene pairs using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression to evaluate the prognosis of patients after liver cancer resection. We then used 845 liver cancer samples from three different databases to test the reliability of the risk signature through survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, univariate and multivariate analysis. To further explore the underlying biological mechanisms, we conducted an enrichment analysis of autophagy-related genes. Finally, we combined the signature with independent prognostic factors to construct a nomogram. Based on the autophagy-related gene pair (ARGP) signature, we can divide patients into high- or low-risk groups. Survival analysis and ROC curve analysis verified the validity of the signature (AUC: 0.786-0.828). Multivariate Cox regression showed that the risk score can be used as an independent predictor of the clinical outcomes of liver cancer patients. Notably, this model has a more accurate predictive effect than most prognostic models for hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, our model is a powerful supplement to the HCC staging indicator, and a nomogram comprising both indicators can provide a better prognostic effect. Based on pairs of multiple autophagy-related genes, we proposed a prognostic model for predicting the overall survival rate of HCC patients after surgery, which is a promising prognostic indicator. This study confirms the importance of autophagy in the occurrence and development of HCC, and also provides potential biomarkers for targeted treatments.",

        "Abstract": "1-Methyl-4,5-dinitroimidazole (MDNI)/1-methyl-3,4,5-trinitropyrazole (MTNP) mixtures with different mass ratios were investigated by a combination of theory and experiment. The melting points were predicted using the relationships of specific volume versus temperature, non-bond energy versus temperature, and diffusion coefficient versus temperature, and compared with the experimental values. It was found that the melting point values obtained from the three relationships were in good agreement with the experimentally measured melting points with little error. The interactions between MDNI/MTNP were analyzed by binding energy and RDF, and the results showed that, as the temperature increased, the intermolecular interactions weakened, the binding energy decreased, and the stability of the system decreased. The comprehensive results show that mixture 4 (MDNI/MTNP = 60/40) has a low melting point value and good compatibility, and the detonation velocity and density are improved compared with TNT and MDNI, which is expected to be further applied in melt-cast explosives.",

        "Abstract": "Exosomes are small membranous vesicles released by many kinds of cells, and are indispensable in cell-to-cell communication by delivering functional biological components both locally and systemically. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are long transcripts over 200 nucleotides that exhibit no or limited protein-coding potentials. LncRNAs are dramatic gene expression regulators, and can be selectively sorted into exosomes. Exosomal lncRNAs derived from cancer cells and stromal cells can mediate the generation of pre-metastatic niches (PMNs) and thus promote the progression of cancer. In this review, we summarized the fundamental biology and characteristics of exosomal lncRNAs. Besides, we provided an overview of current research on functions of exosomal lncRNAs between cancer cells and non-cancer cells. A deep understanding of exosomal lncRNAs' role in cancer will be facilitated to find important implications for cancer development and treatment.",

        "Title": "Influence of Temperature Variation on the Vibrational Characteristics of Fused Silica Cylindrical Resonators for Coriolis Vibratory Gyroscopes.",
        "Abstract": "The fused silica cylindrical resonator is a type of axisymmetric resonator that can be used for Coriolis vibratory gyroscopes. Although the resonant frequency, frequency mismatch, and Q factor are natural properties of the resonator, they can change with temperature. Therefore, the temperature drift severely limits the detection accuracy and bias stability of the gyroscope. In this paper, the influence of temperature variation on the vibrational characteristics of fused silica cylindrical resonators was investigated. Experiments were performed on a fused silica cylindrical resonator coated with Cr/Au films. It was shown that at the temperature range from 253.15 K to 353.15 K, the resonant frequency linearly increased with temperature, the frequency mismatch remained unchanged, and the Q factor gradually increased till about 333.15 K, when it began to decrease. Meanwhile, the change of thermoelastic damping with temperature may dominate the variation of Q factor at the temperature range from 253.15 K to 353.15 K. This phenomenon was theoretically analyzed and the variation trends of results were consistent with the theoretical analysis. This study indicates that, for the fused silica cylindrical resonator, to discover the influence of temperature variation on the resonant frequency, frequency mismatch, and Q factor, there are certain rules to follow and repeat. The relationship between temperature and frequency can be established, which provides the feasibility of using self-calibration based on temperature characteristics of the resonator for temperature drift compensations. Additionally, there is an optimum temperature that may improve the performance of the Coriolis vibratory gyroscope with the fused silica cylindrical resonator.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in literature for a constellation of MAS, glomerulonephritis, pericarditis, and retinal vasculitis as initial presentation of SLE. Despite extensive multisystem involvement of his disease, the patient responded well to initial steroid treatment, with mycophenolate mofetil successfully added as a steroid-sparing agent. Our case highlights the importance of multispecialty collaboration in the diagnosis and management of SLE with multisystem involvement.",

        "Title": "Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with increased in-hospital mortality in asthma exacerbations: a nationwide study.",
        "Abstract": "The relationship between RA and asthma has been yielding conflicting results, with most recent studies showing a possible positive association. The study aims at the outcomes of adult patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation in those with and without RA. We used data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) for the period of 2012-2014. ICD 9 code was used to identify the diagnosis. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Our secondary outcome was total asthma exacerbation hospitalizations, length of stay, and total hospital charges. Compared to those without RA, RA was associated with increased hospitalizations for asthma exacerbation (unadjusted OR 1.29, p < 0.001; adjusted OR 1.06, p = 0.002), more respiratory and systemic comorbidities, increased in-hospital mortality (unadjusted OR 1.89, p = 0.001; adjusted OR 1.60, p = 0.020), length of stay (4.5 vs 3.8; unadjusted p < 0.001, adjusted p < 0.001), and total hospital charges (30,149 vs 26,247; unadjusted p < 0.001, adjusted p = 0.048). Our study was the first to demonstrate that RA is associated with increased in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and cost using a national inpatient database. We hypothesize that in asthmatic patients with concurrent RA, their asthma may represent a distinctive subgroup that is more severe and carries a poorer prognosis, which deserves more attention and future investigation.",

        "Title": "Atlantic deep water circulation during the last interglacial.",
        "Abstract": "Understanding how the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) evolved during crucial past geological periods is important in order to decipher the interplay between ocean dynamics and global climate change. Previous research, based on geological proxies, has provided invaluable insights into past AMOC changes. However, the causes of the changes in water mass distributions in the Atlantic during different periods remain mostly elusive. Using a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we show that the bulk of NCW in the deep South Atlantic Ocean below 4000 m migrated from the western basins at 125 ka to the eastern basins at 115 ka, though the AMOC strength is only slightly reduced. These changes are consistent with proxy records, and it is mainly due to more penetration of the AABW at depth at 115 ka, as a result of a larger density of AABW formed at 115 ka. Our results show that depth changes in regional deep water pathways can result in large local changes, while the overall AMOC structure hardly changes. Future research should thus be careful when interpreting single proxy records in terms of large-scale AMOC changes, and considering variability of water-mass distributions on sub-basin scale would give more comprehensive interpretations of sediment records.",

We describe a case of anti-PR3 ANCA-positive EGPA complicated by congestive heart failure and intraventricular thrombosis. Interestingly, the thrombus was resolved rapidly with steroid and cyclophosphamide in the setting of interrupted anticoagulation. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of anti-PR3 positive EGPA with extensive cardiac involvement. Our patient had overlapping features with previously studied ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative EGPA cases. We also hypothesize that the thrombogenic potential of eosinophils may play a central role in thrombogenesis in EGPA and aggressive immunosuppressive therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment, and the addition of anticoagulation therapy in the setting of thrombus formation and also very high risk of bleeding needs to be considered cautiously.",

The surface of the PLA sample ablated by high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser was analysed using field emission scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, raman spectroscopy, as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Compared with the experiments in the air at ambient temperature, melting resolidification was negligible for the experiments conducted under water. Neither in air nor under water did oxidation and crystallization process take place in the laser ablated surface. In addition, the intensity of some oxygen related peaks increased for water experiments, probably due to the hydrolysis. Meantime, the chemical shift to higher energies appeared in C1s XPS spectrum of laser processing in water. Interestingly, a large amount of defects were observed after laser processing in air, while no significant change was shown under water experiments. This indicates that thermal and mechanical effects by high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser ablation in water are quite limited, which could be even ignored.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the traits contributing to the invasiveness of Alnus formosana and the mechanisms underlying its invasiveness, we compared A. formosana with its native congener (Alnus cremastogyne) under three light treatments (13%, 56%, and 100%). The consistently higher plant height, total leaf area, light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)), light saturation point (LSP), light compensation point (LCP), respiration efficiency (RE), and non-photochemical quenching coefficient (NPQ) but lower root mass fraction (RMF) and specific leaf area (SLA) of the invader than of its native congener contributed to the higher RGR and total biomass of A. formosana across light regimes. The total biomass and RGR of the invader increased markedly with increased RMF, A(max), LSP, LCP, RE, stomatal conductance (G(s)) and total leaf area. Furthermore, compared with the native species, the higher plasticity index in plant height, RMF, leaf mass fraction (LMF), SMF, SLA, A(max) and dark respiration rate (R(d)) within the range of total light contributed to the higher performance of the invader. In addition, the activities of antioxidant enzymes were higher in the invader compared to the native, contributing to its invasion success under high/low light via photoprotection. With a decrease in light level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities increased significantly, whereas total carotenoid (Car) and total chlorophyll (Chl) decreased; ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities remained unchanged. These responses may help the invader to spread and invade a wide range of habitats and form dense monocultures, displacing native plant species. The results suggest that both resource capture-related traits (morphological and photosynthetic) and adaptation-related traits (antioxidant protection) contribute to the competitive advantage of the invader.",

        "Abstract": "Driven by the growing numbers of intensified pig farms around cities in China, there are problems of nutrient surplus and shortage of arable land for utilising the manure. Hence, sustainable livestock systems with effective manure management are needed. The objective of this study is to compare the existing manure treatment of a typical pig farm in Beijing area (separate collection of faeces; 'Gan qing fen' system) with an alternative system and to identify the nutrients flow of the whole farm in order to quantify environmental burdens and to estimate the arable land required for sustainable nutrients recycling. Life cycle assessment is used for this purpose. Acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP) and global warming potential (GWP) are analysed in detail; the functional unit is the annual production of the pig farm. The results show that the cropland area demand for sustainable land application of the effluent can be reduced from 238 to 139 ha with the alternative system. It is possible to transfer 29% of total nitrogen, 87% of phosphorus, 34% of potassium and 75% of magnesium to the compost, and to reduce the total AP, EP and GWP of manure management on the farm by 64.1%, 96.7% and 22%, respectively, compared with the current system. Besides an effective manure management system, a full inventory of the regional nutrients flow is needed for sustainable development of livestock systems around big cities in China.",

        "Abstract": "A laboratory scale experiment of composting in a forced aeration system using pig manure with cornstalks was carried out to investigate the effects of both phosphogypsum and dicyandiamide (DCD, C2H4N4) as additives on gaseous emissions and compost quality. Besides a control, there were three amended treatments with different amounts of additives. The results indicated that the phosphogypsum addition at the rate of 10% of mixture dry weight decreased NH3 and CH4 emissions significantly during composting. The addition of DCD at the rate of 0.2% of mixture dry weight together with 10% of phosphogypsum further reduced the N2O emission by affecting the nitrification process. Reducing the phosphogypsum addition to 5% in the presence of 0.2% DCD moderately increased the NH3 emissions but not N2O emission. The additives increased the ammonium content and electrical conductivity significantly in the final compost. No adverse effect on organic matter degradation or the germination index of the compost was found in the amended treatments. It was recommended that phosphogypsum and DCD could be used in composting for the purpose of reducing NH3, CH4 and N2O emissions. Optimal conditions and dose of DCD additive during composting should be determined with different materials and composting systems in further study.",

        "Abstract": "Transfer station (TS) is an integral part of present-day municipal solid waste (MSW) management systems. To provide information for the incorporation of waste facilities within the current integrated waste management system, the authors measured the existing environmental quality at five MSW TSs. Discharged wastewater, air, and noise were monitored and assayed at the five TSs in Beijing in 2001-2006 during rainy seasons (RSs) and dry seasons (DSs). Except Ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the analytical results of total suspended particles (TSPs), odor, noise, ammonium nitrogen (NH4(+)-N), chemical oxygen demand (COD(Cr)), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), suspended solid (SS), and fecal coliform concentrations were all degree-varied higher than the criteria limit in China. Using fuzzy mathematics, the environmental quality of MSW TSs in Beijing was classified into five categories, with levels of certainty of belonging to different categories and evaluations. The result indicated that the whole environmental quality of Datun TS, Majialou TS, and Xiaowuji TS, in Beijing, were bad during 2001-2006 in RSs and DSs. Except in 2002, the entire environmental quality of the Wuluju TS during 2001-2006 in RSs was poor. Only in the DSs of 2002 and 2003 was the whole environmental quality of the Wuluju TS good. The whole environmental quality of the Yamenkou TS during 2001-2006 in DSs was bad, which was lower than that of 2001-2006 DSs.",
