        "Title": "Amplification of Signal on Cell Surfaces in Molecular Cascades.",
        "Abstract": "We can formulate mixtures of oligonucleotide-antibody conjugates to act as molecular cascade-based automata that analyze pairs of cell surface markers (CD markers) on individual cells in a manner consistent with the implementation of Boolean logic-for example, by producing a fluorescent label only if two markers are present. While traditional methods to characterize cells are based on transducing signals from individual cell surface markers, these cascades can be used to combine into a single signal the presence of two or even more CDs. In our original design, oligonucleotide components irreversibly flowed from one antibody to another, driven by increased hybridizations, leading to the magnitude of the final signal on each cell being determined by the surface marker that was the least abundant. This is a significant limitation to the precise labeling of narrow subpopulations, and, in order to overcome it, we changed our design to accomplish signal amplification to a more abundant cell surface marker. We show the AMPLIFY function on two examples: (1) we amplify the fluorescent label from the CD19 marker onto a fivefold more abundant CD45, and (2) we amplify broadly distributed CD45RA to a more constant marker, CD3. We expect this new function to enable the increasingly complex Boolean analysis of cell surfaces.",

        "Abstract": "Aptameric receptors are important biosensor components, yet our ability to identify them depends on the target structures. We analyzed the contributions of individual functional groups on small molecules to binding within 27 target-aptamer pairs, identifying potential hindrances to receptor isolation-for example, negative cooperativity between sterically hindered functional groups. To increase the probability of aptamer isolation for important targets, such as leucine and voriconazole, for which multiple previous selection attempts failed, we designed tailored strategies focused on overcoming individual structural barriers to successful selections. This approach enables us to move beyond standardized protocols into functional group-guided searches, relying on sequences common to receptors for targets and their analogs to serve as anchors in regions of vast oligonucleotide spaces wherein useful reagents are likely to be found.",

Controlling the extent of biotinylation is important for meeting the requirements of the intended design and to preserve the native function of the biotin recipient. Within the protein world, a\"trial-and-error\" optimization approach toward biotinylation reaction conditions is often necessary due to widely varying properties of proteins. Therefore, product analysis is important. We show here that a oligonucleotide-blocked streptavidin, effectively \"monovalent streptavidin\", can tag biotin moieties individually and the tagged products visualized via a polyacrylamide gel shift assay to reveal the product ",

        "Title": "New therapeutic approaches and novel alternatives for organophosphate toxicity.",
        "Abstract": "Organophosphate compounds (OPCs) are commonly used as pesticides and were developed as nerve agents for chemical warfare. Exposure to OPCs results in toxicity due to their covalent binding and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Treatment for toxicity due to OPC exposure has been largely focused on the reactivation of AChE by oxime-based compounds via direct nucleophilic attack on the phosphorous center. However, due to the disadvantages to existing oxime-based reactivators for treatment of OPC poisoning, we considered non-oxime mechanisms of reactivation. A high throughput screen of compound libraries was performed to discover previously unidentified reactivation compounds, followed by studies on their analogs. In the process, we discovered multiple non-oxime classes of compounds, the most robust of which we have already reported [1]. Herein, we report other classes of compounds we identified in our screen that are efficient at reactivation. During biochemical characterization, we also found some compounds with other activities that may inspire novel therapeutic approaches to OPC toxicity. Specifically, we found compounds that [1] increase the rate of substrate hydrolysis by AChE and, [2] protect the enzyme from inhibition by OPC. Further, we discovered that a subset of reactivator compounds recover activity from both AChE and the related enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). We now report these compounds, their activities and discuss how each relates to therapeutic approaches that would provide alternatives to traditional oxime-based reactivation.",

        "Abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that has been covalently inhibited by organophosphate compounds (OPCs), such as nerve agents and pesticides, has traditionally been reactivated by using nucleophilic oximes. There is, however, a clearly recognized need for new classes of compounds with the ability to reactivate inhibited AChE with improved in vivo efficacy. Here we describe our discovery of new functional groups--Mannich phenols and general bases--that are capable of reactivating OPC--inhibited AChE more efficiently than standard oximes and we describe the cooperative mechanism by which these functionalities are delivered to the active site. These discoveries, supported by preliminary in vivo results and crystallographic data, significantly broaden the available approaches for reactivation of AChE.",

        "Abstract": "Oligonucleotide-based receptors or aptamers can interact with small molecules, but the ability to achieve high-affinity and specificity of these interactions depends strongly on functional groups or epitopes displayed by the binding targets. Some classes of targets are particularly challenging: for example, monosaccharides have scarce functionalities and no aptamers have been reported to recognize, let alone distinguish from each other, glucose and other hexoses. Here we report aptamers that differentiate low-epitope targets such as glucose, fructose or galactose by forming ternary complexes with high-epitope organic receptors for monosaccharides. In a follow-up example, we expand this method to isolate high-affinity oligonucleotides against aromatic amino acids complexed in situ with a nonspecific organometallic receptor. The method is general and enables broad clinical use of aptamers for the detection of small molecules in mix-and-measure assays, as demonstrated by monitoring postprandial waves of phenylalanine in human subjects.",

        "Abstract": "CONSPECTUS: The successes of electronic digital logic have transformed every aspect of human life over the last half-century. The word \"computer\" now signifies a ubiquitous electronic device, rather than a human occupation. Yet evidently humans, large assemblies of molecules, can compute, and it has been a thrilling challenge to develop smaller, simpler, synthetic assemblies of molecules that can do useful computation. When we say that molecules compute, what we usually mean is that such molecules respond to certain inputs, for example, the presence or absence of other molecules, in a precisely defined but potentially complex fashion. The simplest way for a chemist to think about computing molecules is as sensors that can integrate the presence or absence of multiple analytes into a change in a single reporting property. Here we review several forms of molecular computing developed in our laboratories. When we began our work, combinatorial approaches to using DNA for computing were used to search for solutions to constraint satisfaction problems. We chose to work instead on logic circuits, building bottom-up from units based on catalytic nucleic acids, focusing on DNA secondary structures in the design of individual circuit elements, and reserving the combinatorial opportunities of DNA for the representation of multiple signals propagating in a large circuit. Such circuit design directly corresponds to the intuition about sensors transforming the detection of analytes into reporting properties. While this approach was unusual at the time, it has been adopted since by other groups working on biomolecular computing with different nucleic acid chemistries. We created logic gates by modularly combining deoxyribozymes (DNA-based enzymes cleaving or combining other oligonucleotides), in the role of reporting elements, with stem-loops as input detection elements. For instance, a deoxyribozyme that normally exhibits an oligonucleotide substrate recognition region is modified such that a stem-loop closes onto the substrate recognition region, making it unavailable for the substrate and thus rendering the deoxyribozyme inactive. But a conformational change can then be induced by an input oligonucleotide, complementary to the loop, to open the stem, allow the substrate to bind, and allow its cleavage to proceed, which is eventually reported via fluorescence. In this Account, several designs of this form are reviewed, along with their application in the construction of large circuits that exhibited complex logical and temporal relationships between the inputs and the outputs. Intelligent (in the sense of being capable of nontrivial information processing) theranostic (therapy + diagnostic) applications have always been the ultimate motivation for developing computing (i.e., decision-making) circuits, and we review our experiments with logic-gate elements bound to cell surfaces that evaluate the proximal presence of multiple markers on lymphocytes.",

Here, we describe automata based on strand-displacement cascades directed by antibodies that can analyse cells by using their surface markers as inputs. The final output of a molecular automaton that successfully completes its analysis is the presence of a unique molecular tag on the cell surface of a specific subpopulation of lymphocytes within human blood cells.",

The device consists of a microchamber packed with aptamer-functionalized microbeads and integrated with a microheater and temperature sensor to enable thermally controlled binding and release of biomolecules by the aptamer. We first present an equilibrium binding-based analytical model to understand the enrichment process. The characteristics of the aptamer-analyte binding and enrichment are then experimentally studied, using adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and a specific RNA aptamer as a model system. The temporal process of AMP binding to the aptamer is found to be primarily determined by the aptamer-AMP binding kinetics. The temporal process of aptamer-AMP dissociation at varying temperatures is also obtained and observed to occur relatively rapidly (< 2 s). The specificity of the enrichment is next confirmed by performing selective enrichment of AMP from a sample containing biomolecular impurities. Finally, we investigate the enrichment of AMP by either discrete or continuous introduction of a dilute sample into the microchamber, demonstrating enrichment factors ranging from 566 to 686×, which agree with predictions of the analytical model.",

A survey of recently implemented solution-phase circuitry indicates that this statement could be replaced with 'we pre-mixed a set of molecules to do X and functional subsets of X'. These hard-wired mixtures are then exposed to a set of molecular inputs, which can be interpreted as being keyed to human moves in a game, or as assertions of logical propositions. In nucleic acids-based systems, stemming from DNA computation, these inputs can be seen as generic oligonucleotides. Here, we report using reconfigurable nucleic acid catalyst-based units to build a multipurpose reprogrammable molecular automaton that goes beyond single-purpose 'hard-wired' molecular automata. The automaton covers all possible responses to two consecutive sets of four inputs (such as four first and four second moves for a generic set of trivial two-player two-move games). This is a model system for more general molecular field programmable gate array (FPGA)-like devices that can be programmed by example, which means that the operator need not have any knowledge of molecular computing methods.",

We recently described the use of cooled radiofrequency (RF) electrodes for performing lateral branch neurotomy to treat sacroiliac joint pain. The procedure involves lesioning the lateral branches of the posterior primary rami at S1-S3, and the L5 dorsal ramus (L5DR). While the cooled RF electrode has been adopted as a means for lesioning the lateral branches, conventional RF electrodes are used to lesion the L5DR. The objective of this technical report is to evaluate the acute safety of denervating the L5DR using cooled RF electrode.",

        "Abstract": "The full understanding of dynamics of cellular processes hinges on the development of efficient and non-invasive labels for intracellular RNA species. Light-up aptamers binding fluorogenic ligands show promise as specific labels for RNA species containing those aptamers. Herein, we took advantage of existing, non-light-up aptamers against small molecules and demonstrated a new class of light-up probes in vitro. We synthesized two conjugates of thiazole orange dye to small molecules (GMP and AMP) and characterized in vitro their interactions with corresponding RNA aptamers. The conjugates preserved specific binding to aptamers while showing several 100-fold increase in fluorescence of the dye (the 'light-up' property). In the presence of free small molecules, conjugates can be displaced from aptamers serving also as fluorescent sensors. Our in vitro results provide the proof-of-concept that the small-molecule conjugates with light-up properties can serve as a general approach to label RNA sequences containing aptamers.",

We conclude that, while the performance of the TO dye displacement approach is not always predictable, it is still a simple and sensitive assay to detect binding between RNA aptamers and small molecules. In particular, we describe efficient assays for tobramycin and theophylline, with up to 90% displacement of TO observed, and we describe the first aptameric assay for cAMP.",

We present a case in which a patient received intrathecal morphine infusion, and then experienced a clinical course that may have involved hyperalgesia, toxicity, and/or withdrawal. The possible differential diagnosis of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, toxicity, and withdrawal, and its implications in clinical pain management, are discussed. This report demonstrates the complexity of treating patients with long-term continuous intrathecal opioids when modest adjustment of the intrathecal cocktail results in a paradoxical clinical course.",

The long bones and the lower extremities are predominantly affected, equally in males and females between 30 and 70 years of age. In the estimation of its biological behaviour, histological graduation (G), the surgical localization of the tumour (T) and the presence or absence of metastases (M), are very important. A tumour with low grade differentiation, with transosseal propagation and metastases, has a poor prognosis. Surgical resection-amputation, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the therapeutic methods of choice.",

One controversial explanation for these findings is that the most commonly used cutoff value for selecting patients for l-z (facet) joint RF denervation, greater than 50% pain relief after diagnostic blocks, is too low and hence responsible for the high failure rate.",

The sensors for our arrays were selected to maximize their differential responses to the two steroids most different in an arbitrarily chosen parameter named \"shape-length\". The arrays incorporated three previously unreported types of sensors identified through a massive screening effort: (1) three-way junction sensors with neutralized charges within junction; (2) \"self-aggregating sensors\"; and (3) sensors incorporating fluorophore directly in a three-way junction as a spacer. The arrays were tested on seven steroids and an alkaloid (cocaine) over a range of concentrations, and achieved 92-96% accuracy in class assignments, despite the close structural similarities between steroids.",

When exposed to a matrix covered at high densities with oligonucleotide substrates, these molecules diffuse through the matrix continuously cleaving the substrate at rates comparable to those of individual catalysts in solution. Rates of diffusion (movement), processivity, and resident times of assemblies can be controlled through the number of catalytic units and the length of substrate/product recognition regions. The assemblies were characterized at the ensemble level using surface plasmon resonance.",

        "Abstract": "Spinal cord stimulation is the most common mode of neuromodulation used in managing chronic low back pain. It is minimally invasive and reversible as opposed to nerve ablation. The basic scientific background of the initial spinal cord stimulation trials was based on the gate control theory of Melzack and Wall. It has been demonstrated in multiple studies that dorsal horn neuronal activity caused by peripheral noxious stimuli could be inhibited by concomitant stimulation of the dorsal columns. Various other mechanisms, which may play a significant role in the mechanism of action of spinal cord stimulation, include the suppressive effect of spinal cord stimulation on tactile allodynia, increased dorsal horn inhibitory action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), prevention or abolition of peripheral ischemia, and effects on human brain activity. Spinal cord stimulation is indicated in low back pain with radiculopathy, failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, and ischemic heart disease. There is substantial scientific evidence on the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation for treatment of low back and lower extremity pain of neuropathic nature. Clinical studies revealed a success rate of from 50% to 70% with spinal cord stimulation, with decreased pain intensity scores, functional improvement and decreased medication usage. This review discusses multiple aspects of spinal cord stimulation, including pathophysiology and mechanism of action, rationale, indications, technique, clinical effectiveness, and controversial aspects.",

The sum output consisted of four new deoxyribozyme-based logic gates: an ANDAND gate and three ANDNOTANDNOT gates. These gates required the design of a generic three-input deoxyribozyme-based logic gate that can use any three-way combination of activating or inactivating inputs. This generic gate design utilizes an additional inverting element that hybridizes to convert YES logic into NOT logic and vice versa. The system represents the first solution-phase, single test tube, enzymatic full adder and shows the complexity of control over molecular scale events that can be achieved with deoxyribozyme-based logic gates. Similar systems could be applied to control autonomous therapeutic and diagnostic devices.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to present some clinical and radiological manifestations of PNS in relation to bronchogenic carcinoma (BC) and to evaluate the usefulness of imaging findings in the diagnosis of asymptomatic BC. In the study group of 204 patients (146 male and 58 female) with proven bronchogenic carcinoma, PNS was present in 18 (8.62%) patients. The patients with PNS were divided into two groups. The first one consisted of 13 (72.2%) patients with symptoms related to primary tumours while the second one consisted of 5 (27.7%) patients with symptoms, at initial appearance, indicative of disorders of other organs and systems. The predominant disorder was Lambert-Eaton Syndrome, associated with small-cell carcinoma. Endocrine manifestations included: inappropriate antidiuretic hormone production syndrome (small-cell carcinoma), a gonadotropin effect with gynaecomastia and testicular atrophy (planocellular carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma), a case of Cushing Syndrome (small-cell carcinoma), and hypercalcaemia, due to the production of the parathyroid hormone-related peptide, which was associated with planocellular carcinoma. A rare case of bilateral exophthalmos was found as PNS at adenocarcinoma. Digital clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HO) were associated with planocellular and adenocarcinoma, while clubbing was much more common than HO, especially among women. The differences between the two groups were related to the time of PNS appearance. In the first group, PNS occurred late on in the illness, while in the second group, PNS preceded the diagnosis of BC. Alternatively, the disappearance of a clinical or a radiological manifestation of PNS after surgery or chemotherapy may be an indicator of an improvement in health or PNS may be the first sign of illness recurrence. Radiological manifestations of PNS in asymptomatic patients may serve as a useful screen for identifying primary BC. In symptomatic patients, it may be an indicator of a higher likelihood of metastatic disease.",

These sensors consist of: (a) a reporting domain, which signals the binding event of an analyte through binding to a fluorophore; (b) a recognition domain, which binds the analyte; and (c) a communication module, which serves as a conduit between recognition and signaling domains. We tested recognition regions specific for ATP, FMN, and theophylline in combinations with malachite green binding aptamer as a signaling domain. In each case, we were able to obtain a functional sensor capable of responding to an increase in analyte concentration with an increase in fluorescence. Similar constructs that consist only of natural RNA could be expressed in cells and used as sensors for intracellular imaging.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a molecular automaton, called MAYA, which encodes a version of the game of tic-tac-toe and interactively competes against a human opponent. The automaton is a Boolean network of deoxyribozymes that incorporates 23 molecular-scale logic gates and one constitutively active deoxyribozyme arrayed in nine wells (3x3) corresponding to the game board. To make a move, MAYA carries out an analysis of the input oligonucleotide keyed to a particular move by the human opponent and indicates a move by fluorescence signaling in a response well. The cycle of human player input and automaton response continues until there is a draw or a victory for the automaton. The automaton cannot be defeated because it implements a perfect strategy.",

        "Abstract": "We report herein a novel system for the parallel processing of molecular recognition events utilizing arrays of oligonucleotide-based fluorescent sensors to characterize hydrophobic molecules in solution. The binding domains of the sensors were based on three-way junctions that utilize double helical stems as framework regions to reliably fold regardless of variations in or around the binding domain. A reporting domain was introduced by the specific substitution of a single phosphodiester group with a phosphorothioate, followed by selective functionalization with a fluorophore. The sensors were organized into cross-reactive arrays to yield characteristic fingerprints for samples containing hydrophobic molecules. The fingerprints can be used to characterize steroids in solution, including complex biologically important fluids. Arrays have the potential for clinical applications such as the detection of gross errors in steroidogenesis.",

Two deoxyribozymes mimic i(1)ANDNOTi(2) and i(2)ANDNOTi(1) gates that cleave a fluorogenic substrate, reporting through an increase in fluorescence emission at 570 nm. The third deoxyribozyme mimics an i(1)ANDi(2) gate and cleaves the other fluorogenic substrate, reporting through an increase in fluorescence emission at 520 nm. Together, this system represents the first example of a decision-making enzymatic network with two inputs and two outputs. Similar systems could be applied to control autonomous therapeutic and diagnostic devices.",

        "Abstract": "Complex of an anti-cocaine aptamer and the dye diethylthiotricarbocyanine behaves as a colorimetric sensor with attenuation in absorbance at 760 nm for cocaine in the concentration range of 2-600 muM. Mechanistic studies indicate an intermolecular displacement of the dye as the mechanism of action of the sensor. As the dye is insoluble in buffer, cocaine binding can be followed with the unaided eye as displaced dye precipitates and supernatant decolorizes.",

        "Abstract": "Although epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are a common treatment for chronic pain conditions, it is not clear whether there is consensus on their technical aspects. The current literature suggests that variations in technical aspects may affect ESI outcomes. The goal of the survey was to help establish a standard frame of reference for the performance of ESIs. We analyzed survey results from 68 academic anesthesia programs and 28 private practices in the United States. The main finding in this survey is that there is no clear-cut consensus as to the ideal method to perform ESI. There is a wide variation among individual practices in almost every technical aspect of ESI. Private practices use significantly more fluoroscopy than academic centers. The large difference was found in the cervical region where 73% of private practices and only 39% of academic institutions polled perform the ESIs with fluoroscopic guidance (P = 0.005). A similar discrepancy was found in approaches to the epidural space after laminectomy where 61% of private practices, but only 15% of academic centers, use the transforaminal approach. The study results indicate that there is no consensus, and that there is a wide variation in current practices.",

These gates were constructed through a modular design that combines molecular beacon stem-loops with hammerhead-type deoxyribozymes. Importantly, as the gates have oligonucleotides as both inputs and output, they open the possibility of communication between various computation elements in solution. The operation of these gates is conveniently connected to a fluorescent readout.",
