        "Abstract": "Many physiological osteocalcin-regulated functions are affected in adult offspring of mothers experiencing unhealthy pregnancy. Furthermore, osteocalcin signaling during gestation influences cognition and adrenal steroidogenesis in adult mice. Together these observations suggest that osteocalcin may broadly function during pregnancy to determine organismal homeostasis in adult mammals. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed in unchallenged wildtype and Osteocalcin-deficient, newborn and adult mice of various genotypes and origin maintained on different genetic backgrounds, the functions of osteocalcin in the pancreas, liver and testes and their molecular underpinnings. This analysis revealed that providing mothers are Osteocalcin-deficient, Osteocalcin haploinsufficiency in embryos hampers insulin secretion, liver gluconeogenesis, glucose homeostasis, testes steroidogenesis in adult offspring; inhibits cell proliferation in developing pancreatic islets and testes; and disrupts distinct programs of gene expression in these organs and in the brain. This study indicates that osteocalcin exerts dominant functions in most organs it influences. Furthermore, through their synergistic regulation of multiple physiological functions, osteocalcin of maternal and embryonic origins contributes to the establishment and maintenance of organismal homeostasis in newborn and adult offspring.",

Following its binding to one of three receptors, osteocalcin exerts a profound influence on various aspects of energy metabolism as well as steroidogenesis, neurotransmitter biosynthesis and thereby male fertility, electrolyte homeostasis, cognition, the acute stress response, and exercise capacity. Although this review focuses mostly on the regulation of energy metabolism by osteocalcin, it also touches on its other functions.

Given its recently demonstrated role as a mediator of the bone to muscle to bone crosstalk during exercise, we hypothesized that interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in bone may contribute to the beneficial effect that exercise has on bone homeostasis.

        "Abstract": "Genetics in model organisms has progressively broken down walls that previously separated different disciplines of biology. One example of this holistic evolution is the recognition of the complex relationship that exists between the control of bone mass (bone remodeling) and energy metabolism in mammals. Numerous hormones orchestrate this crosstalk. In particular, the study of the leptin-mediated regulation of bone mass has not only revealed the existence of a central control of bone mass but has also led to the realization that sympathetic innervation is a major regulator of bone remodeling. This happened at a time when the use of drugs aiming at treating osteoporosis, the most frequent bone disease, has dwindled. This review will highlight the main aspects of the leptin-mediated regulation of bone mass and how this led to the realization that β-blockers, which block the effects of the sympathetic nervous system, may be a viable option to prevent osteoporosis.",

Exploring this issue has been an extraordinarily powerful way to improve our knowledge of bone development and physiology. More recently, a second question has emerged: does bone have other functions besides making bone? Addressing this conundrum revealed that the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin affects a surprisingly large number of organs and physiological processes, including acute stress response. This review will focus on this emerging aspect of bone biology taking osteocalcin as a case study and will show how classical and endocrine functions of bone help to define a new functional identity for this tissue.",

        "Abstract": "Through their ability to regulate gene expression in most organs, glucocorticoid (GC) hormones influence numerous physiological processes and are therefore key regulators of organismal homeostasis. In bone, GC hormones inhibit expression of the hormone Osteocalcin for poorly understood reasons. Here, we show that in a classical endocrine feedback loop, osteocalcin in return enhanced the biosynthesis of GC as well as mineralocorticoid hormones (adrenal steroidogenesis) in rodents and primates. Conversely, inactivation of osteocalcin signaling in adrenal glands significantly impaired adrenal growth and steroidogenesis in mice. Embryo-made osteocalcin was necessary for normal Sf1 expression in fetal adrenal cells and adrenal cell steroidogenic differentiation and therefore determined the number of steroidogenic cells present in the adrenal glands of adult animals. Embryonic, not postnatal, osteocalcin also governed adrenal growth, adrenal steroidogenesis, blood pressure, electrolyte equilibrium, and the rise in circulating corticosterone levels during the acute stress response in adult offspring. This osteocalcin-dependent regulation of adrenal development and steroidogenesis occurred even in the absence of a functional hypothalamus/pituitary/adrenal axis and explains why osteocalcin administration during pregnancy promoted adrenal growth and steroidogenesis and improved the survival of adrenocorticotropic hormone signaling-deficient animals. This study reveals that a bone-derived embryonic hormone influences lifelong adrenal functions and organismal homeostasis in the mouse.",

        "Abstract": "The alternation of resorption of preexisting bone by the osteoclasts followed by de novo bone formation by osteoblasts is called bone modeling during childhood and bone remodeling during adulthood. A central question raised by this physiological process that is fundamental to longitudinal growth during childhood and adolescence and that is attacked at the other end of life in the context of osteoporosis is to know how it is regulated. This question was rejuvenated in the late 1990s and early 2000s years when the application of mouse genetics made it feasible to test whether there were new endocrine determinants of bone (re)modeling. Addressing this question, taking into account fundamental cell biology features of bone led to the hypothesis that there should be a coordinated control of bone growth/mass, energy metabolism, and reproduction. Testing genetically and molecularly, this hypothesis revealed that, in vivo, the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin is a powerful inhibitor of bone mass accrual following its signaling in the brain. This chapter details the molecular bases and biological relevance of this regulation of bone mass accrual by leptin.",

        "Abstract": "Given the numerous health benefits of exercise, understanding how exercise capacity is regulated is a question of paramount importance. Circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels surge during exercise and IL-6 favors exercise capacity. However, neither the cellular origin of circulating IL-6 during exercise nor the means by which this cytokine enhances exercise capacity has been formally established yet. Here we show through genetic means that the majority of circulating IL-6 detectable during exercise originates from muscle and that to increase exercise capacity, IL-6 must signal in osteoblasts to favor osteoclast differentiation and the release of bioactive osteocalcin in the general circulation. This explains why mice lacking the IL-6 receptor only in osteoblasts exhibit a deficit in exercise capacity of similar severity to the one seen in mice lacking muscle-derived IL-6 (mIL-6), and why this deficit is correctable by osteocalcin but not by IL-6. Furthermore, in agreement with the notion that IL-6 acts through osteocalcin, we demonstrate that mIL-6 promotes nutrient uptake and catabolism into myofibers during exercise in an osteocalcin-dependent manner. Finally, we show that the crosstalk between osteocalcin and IL-6 is conserved between rodents and humans. This study provides evidence that a muscle-bone-muscle endocrine axis is necessary to increase muscle function during exercise in rodents and humans.",

        "Abstract": "We hypothesized that bone evolved, in part, to enhance the ability of bony vertebrates to escape danger in the wild. In support of this notion, we show here that a bone-derived signal is necessary to develop an acute stress response (ASR). Indeed, exposure to various types of stressors in mice, rats (rodents), and humans leads to a rapid and selective surge of circulating bioactive osteocalcin because stressors favor the uptake by osteoblasts of glutamate, which prevents inactivation of osteocalcin prior to its secretion. Osteocalcin permits manifestations of the ASR to unfold by signaling in post-synaptic parasympathetic neurons to inhibit their activity, thereby leaving the sympathetic tone unopposed. Like wild-type animals, adrenalectomized rodents and adrenal-insufficient patients can develop an ASR, and genetic studies suggest that this is due to their high circulating osteocalcin levels. We propose that osteocalcin defines a bony-vertebrate-specific endocrine mediation of the ASR.",

        "Abstract": "A remarkable, unexpected aspect of the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin is that it is necessary for both brain development and brain function in the mouse, as its absence results in a profound deficit in spatial learning and memory and an exacerbation of anxiety-like behaviour. The regulation of cognitive function by osteocalcin, together with the fact that its circulating levels decrease in midlife compared with adolescence in all species tested, raised the prospect that osteocalcin might be an anti-geronic hormone that could prevent age-related cognitive decline. As presented in this Review, recent data indicate that this is indeed the case and that osteocalcin is necessary for the anti-geronic activity recently ascribed to the plasma of young wild-type mice. The diversity and amplitude of the functions of osteocalcin in the brain, during development and postnatally, had long called for the identification of its receptor in the brain, which was also recently achieved. This Review presents our current understanding of the biology of osteocalcin in the brain, highlighting the bony vertebrate specificity of the regulation of cognitive function and pointing toward where therapeutic opportunities might exist.",

        "Abstract": "Exercise is an evolutionary conserved survival function that nowadays has beneficial health effects. The increased metabolic activity of contracting skeletal muscle affects the biology of many organs involved in regulating muscle functions. The discovery of hormones and cytokines secreted by bone and skeletal muscle during exercise, has recently added experimental credence to the notion that a crosstalk exists between these organs. Bone through the hormone osteocalcin, promotes exercise capacity in the mouse. After binding to a G-coupled protein receptor, Gprc6a, osteocalcin increases nutrients uptake and catabolism in myofibers during exercise. The catabolic aspect of osteocalcin distinguishes it from insulin signaling. In addition, osteocalcin regulates the endocrine function of skeletal muscle because it enhances the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 is produced and secreted by contracting skeletal muscle and exerts autocrine, paracrine and systemic effects. One of the systemic functions of IL-6 is to drive the generation of bioactive osteocalcin. Altogether, these studies have revealed a feed-forward loop between bone and skeletal muscle that are necessary and sufficient for optimum exercise capacity. This endocrine regulation of exercise biology, suggest novel and adapted strategies for the prevention or treatment of age related muscle loss.",

        "Abstract": "Circulating levels of undercarboxylated and bioactive osteocalcin double during aerobic exercise at the time levels of insulin decrease. In contrast, circulating levels of osteocalcin plummet early during adulthood in mice, monkeys, and humans of both genders. Exploring these observations revealed that osteocalcin signaling in myofibers is necessary for adaptation to exercise by favoring uptake and catabolism of glucose and fatty acids, the main nutrients of myofibers. Osteocalcin signaling in myofibers also accounts for most of the exercise-induced release of interleukin-6, a myokine that promotes adaptation to exercise in part by driving the generation of bioactive osteocalcin. We further show that exogenous osteocalcin is sufficient to enhance the exercise capacity of young mice and to restore to 15-month-old mice the exercise capacity of 3-month-old mice. This study uncovers a bone-to-muscle feedforward endocrine axis that favors adaptation to exercise and can reverse the age-induced decline in exercise capacity.",

        "Abstract": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 targets the master regulator of osteoblast differentiation, Runx2, for degradation, yet the function of Smurf1, if any, during osteoblast differentiation in vivo is ill defined. Here, we show that Smurf1 prevents osteoblast differentiation by decreasing Runx2 accumulation in osteoblasts. Remarkably, mice harboring a substitution mutation at serine 148 (S148) in Smurf1 that prevents its phosphorylation by AMPK (Smurf1(ki/ki)) display a premature osteoblast differentiation phenotype that is equally severe as that of Smurf1(-/-) mice, as well as a high bone mass, and are also hyperinsulinemic and hypoglycemic. Consistent with the fact that Smurf1 targets the insulin receptor for degradation, there is, in Smurf1(ki/ki) mice, an increase in insulin signaling in osteoblasts that triggers a rise in the circulating levels of osteocalcin, a hormone that favors insulin secretion. These results identify Smurf1 as a determinant of osteoblast differentiation during the development of bone formation and glucose homeostasis post-natally and demonstrate the necessity of S148 for these functions.",

        "Abstract": "Most physiological functions originate with the communication between organs. Mouse genetics has revived this holistic view of physiology through the identification of inter-organ communications that are unanticipated, functionally important, and would have been difficult to uncover otherwise. This Review highlights this point by showing how two tissues usually not seen as endocrine ones, bone and striated muscles, influence several physiological processes in a significant manner.",

        "Abstract": "The synthesis of type I collagen, the main component of bone matrix, precedes the expression of Runx2, the earliest determinant of osteoblast differentiation. We hypothesized that the energetic needs of osteoblasts might explain this apparent paradox. We show here that glucose, the main nutrient of osteoblasts, is transported in these cells through Glut1, whose expression precedes that of Runx2. Glucose uptake favors osteoblast differentiation by suppressing the AMPK-dependent proteasomal degradation of Runx2 and promotes bone formation by inhibiting another function of AMPK. While RUNX2 cannot induce osteoblast differentiation when glucose uptake is compromised, raising blood glucose levels restores collagen synthesis in Runx2-null osteoblasts and initiates bone formation in Runx2-deficient embryos. Moreover, RUNX2 favors Glut1 expression, and this feedforward regulation between RUNX2 and Glut1 determines the onset of osteoblast differentiation during development and the extent of bone formation throughout life. These results reveal an unexpected intricacy between bone and glucose metabolism.",

One of the functions regulated by bone through the hormone osteocalcin is glucose homeostasis. In this overview, we will explain why we hypothesized that bone mass and energy metabolism should be subjected to a coordinated endocrine regulation. We will then review the experiments that revealed the endocrine function of osteocalcin and the cell biology events that allow osteocalcin to become a hormone. We will also illustrate the importance of this regulation to understand whole-body glucose homeostasis in the physiological state and in pathological conditions. Lastly, we will mention epidemiological and genetic evidence demonstrating that this function of osteocalcin is conserved in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Osteocalcin (OCN) is an osteoblast-derived hormone favoring glucose homeostasis, energy expenditure, male fertility, brain development, and cognition. Before being secreted by osteoblasts in the bone extracellular matrix, OCN is γ-carboxylated by the γ-carboxylase (GGCX) on three glutamic acid residues, a cellular process requiring reduction of vitamin K (VK) by a second enzyme, a reductase called VKORC1. Although circumstantial evidence suggests that γ-carboxylation may inhibit OCN endocrine functions, genetic evidence that it is the case is still lacking. Here we show using cell-specific gene inactivation models that γ-carboxylation of OCN by GGCX inhibits its endocrine function. We further show that VKORC1 is required for OCN γ-carboxylation in osteoblasts, whereas its paralogue, VKORC1L1, is dispensable for this function and cannot compensate for the absence of VKORC1 in osteoblasts. This study genetically and biochemically delineates the functions of the enzymes required for OCN modification and demonstrates that it is the uncarboxylated form of OCN that acts as a hormone.",

        "Abstract": "A recent unexpected development of bone biology is that bone is an endocrine organ contributing to the regulation of a number of physiological processes. One of the functions regulated by bone through osteocalcin, an osteoblast specific hormone, is glucose homeostasis. In this overview, we explain the rationale why we hypothesized that there should be a coordinated endocrine regulation between bone mass and energy metabolism. We then review the experiments that identified the endocrine function of osteocalcin and the cell biology events that allow osteocalcin to become a hormone. We also demonstrate the importance of this regulation to understand whole-body glucose homeostasis in the physiological state and in pathological conditions. Lastly we discuss the epidemiological and genetic evidence demonstrating that this function of osteocalcin is conserved in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Our knowledge of whole organism physiology has greatly advanced in the past decades through mouse genetics. In particular, genetic studies have revealed that most organs interact with one another through hormones in order to maintain normal physiological functions and the homeostasis of the entire organism. Remarkably, through these studies many unexpected novel endocrine means to regulate physiological functions have been uncovered. The skeletal system is one example. In this article, we review a series of studies that over the years have identified bone as an endocrine organ. The mechanism of action, pathological relevance, and therapeutic implications of the functions of the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin are discussed. In the last part of this review we discuss the possibility that additional endocrine functions of the skeleton may exist.",

        "Abstract": "The transcription factor FoxO1 regulates multiple physiological processes. Here, we show that FoxO1 is highly expressed in neurons of the locus coeruleus and of various sympathetic ganglions, but not in the adrenal medulla. Consistent with this pattern of expression, mice lacking FoxO1 only in sympathetic neurons (FoxO1 Dbh-/-) display a low sympathetic tone without modification of the catecholamine content in the adrenal medulla. As a result, FoxO1 Dbh-/- mice demonstrate an increased insulin secretion, improved glucose tolerance, low energy expenditure, and high bone mass. FoxO1 favors catecholamine synthesis because it is a potent regulator of the expression of Dbh that encodes the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of these neurotransmitters. By identifying FoxO1 as a transcriptional regulator of the sympathetic tone, these results advance our understanding of the control of some aspects of metabolism and of bone mass accrual.",

        "Abstract": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the sympathetic tone promote Rankl expression in osteoblasts and osteoclast differentiation by enhancing cyclic adenosine monophosphate production through an unidentified transcription factor for PTH and through ATF4 for the sympathetic tone. How two extracellular cues using the same second messenger in the same cell elicit different transcriptional events is unknown. In this paper, we show that PTH favors Rankl expression by triggering the ubiquitination of HDAC4, a class II histone deacetylase, via Smurf2. HDAC4 degradation releases MEF2c, which transactivates the Rankl promoter. Conversely, sympathetic signaling in osteoblasts favors the accumulation of HDAC4 in the nucleus and its association with ATF4. In this context, HDAC4 increases Rankl expression. Because of its ability to differentially connect two extracellular cues to the genome of osteoblasts, HDAC4 is a critical regulator of osteoclast differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin signaling in osteoblasts has been shown recently to contribute to whole-body glucose homeostasis in animals fed a normal diet; however, it is unknown whether bone contributes to the insulin resistance that develops in animals challenged by a high-fat diet (HFD). Here, we evaluated the consequences of osteoblast-specific overexpression of or loss of insulin receptor in HFD-fed mice. We determined that the severity of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance that mice develop when fed a HFD is in part a consequence of osteoblast-dependent insulin resistance. Insulin resistance in osteoblasts led to a decrease in circulating levels of the active form of osteocalcin, thereby decreasing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Insulin resistance developed in osteoblasts as the result of increased levels of free saturated fatty acids, which promote insulin receptor ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Together, these results underscore the involvement of bone, among other tissues, in the disruption of whole-body glucose homeostasis resulting from a HFD and the involvement of insulin and osteocalcin cross-talk in glucose intolerance. Furthermore, our data indicate that insulin resistance develops in bone as the result of lipotoxicity-associated loss of insulin receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Osteocalcin is a hormone produced in bones by osteoblasts and regulating energy metabolism. While osteocalcin exists in two forms, γ-carboxylated and undercarboxylated only the latter appears to function as a hormone in vivo. It has been proposed recently that osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells, are responsible of decarboxylating, i.e. activating osteocalcin. To address the role of osteoclasts in the maintenance of energy metabolism we analyzed mutant mouse strains harboring either an increase or a decrease in osteoclasts number. Osteoprotegerin-deficient mice that are characterized by an increase in the number of osteoclasts demonstrate an increase in serum levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin and are significantly more glucose tolerant than WT animals. Conversely, osteoclasts ablation in mice results in a decrease in serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels and in reduced glucose tolerance. These results support the notion that osteoclasts are controlling glucose metabolism at least in part through the regulation of osteocalcin decarboxylation.",

        "Abstract": "Traditionally, bone has been viewed as a relatively static tissue only fulfilling mechanical and scaffolding function. In the past decade however, this classical view of the bone has considerably evolved towards a more complex picture. It is now clear that the skeleton is not only a recipient for hormonal input but it is also an endocrine organ itself. Through the secretion of an osteoblast-derived molecule, osteocalcin, the skeleton regulates glucose homeostasis and male reproductive functions. When undercarboxylated, osteocalcin acts following its binding to a G-coupled receptor, Gprc6a, on pancreatic β cells to increase insulin secretion, on muscle and white adipose tissue to promote glucose homeostasis and on Leydig cells of the testis to favor testosterone biosynthesis. More recently, it was also shown that osteocalcin acts via a pancreas-bone-testis axis that regulates, independently of and in parallel to the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, male reproductive functions by promoting testosterone biosynthesis. Lastly, in trying to expand the biological relevance of osteocalcin from mouse to human, it was shown that Gprc6a is a potential new susceptibility locus for primary testicular failure in humans. Altogether, these results shed new light on the importance of the endocrine role of the skeleton and also provide credence to the search for additional endocrine functions of this organ.",

        "Abstract": "The powerful regulation of bone mass exerted by the brain suggests the existence of bone-derived signals modulating this regulation or other functions of the brain. We show here that the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to neurons of the brainstem, midbrain, and hippocampus, enhances the synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters, inhibits GABA synthesis, prevents anxiety and depression, and favors learning and memory independently of its metabolic functions. In addition to these postnatal functions, maternal osteocalcin crosses the placenta during pregnancy and prevents neuronal apoptosis before embryos synthesize this hormone. As a result, the severity of the neuroanatomical defects and learning and memory deficits of Osteocalcin(-/-) mice is determined by the maternal genotype, and delivering osteocalcin to pregnant Osteocalcin(-/-) mothers rescues these abnormalities in their Osteocalcin(-/-) progeny. This study reveals that the skeleton via osteocalcin influences cognition and contributes to the maternal influence on fetal brain development.",

        "Abstract": "In order to resorb the mineralized bone extracellular matrix, the osteoclast relies on the generation of a resorption lacuna characterized by the presence of specific proteases and a low pH. Hence, bone resorption by osteoclasts is highly dependent on lysosomes, the organelles specialized in intra- and extracellular material degradation. This is best illustrated by the fact that multiple forms of human osteopetrosis are caused by mutations in genes encoding for lysosomal proteins. Yet, until recently, the molecular mechanisms regulating lysosomal biogenesis and function in osteoclasts were poorly understood. Here we review the latest developments in the study of lysosomal biogenesis and function in osteoclasts with an emphasis on the transcriptional control of these processes.",

        "Abstract": "The osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin promotes testosterone biosynthesis in the mouse testis by binding to GPRC6A in Leydig cells. Interestingly, Osteocalcin-deficient mice exhibit increased levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), a pituitary hormone that regulates sex steroid synthesis in the testes. These observations raise the question of whether LH regulates osteocalcin's reproductive effects. Additionally, there is growing evidence that osteocalcin levels are a reliable marker of insulin secretion and sensitivity and circulating levels of testosterone in humans, but the endocrine function of osteocalcin is unclear. Using mouse models, we found that osteocalcin and LH act in 2 parallel pathways and that osteocalcin-stimulated testosterone synthesis is positively regulated by bone resorption and insulin signaling in osteoblasts. To determine the importance of osteocalcin in humans, we analyzed a cohort of patients with primary testicular failure and identified 2 individuals harboring the same heterozygous missense variant in one of the transmembrane domains of GPRC6A, which prevented the receptor from localizing to the cell membrane. This study uncovers the existence of a second endocrine axis that is necessary for optimal male fertility in the mouse and suggests that osteocalcin modulates reproductive function in humans.",

        "Abstract": "The synthesis of adiponectin, an adipokine with ill-defined functions in animals fed a normal diet, is enhanced by the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin. Here we show that adiponectin signals back in osteoblasts to hamper their proliferation and favor their apoptosis, altogether decreasing bone mass and circulating osteocalcin levels. Adiponectin fulfills these functions, independently of its known receptors and signaling pathways, by decreasing FoxO1 activity in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner. Over time, however, these local effects are masked because adiponectin signals in neurons of the locus coeruleus, also through FoxO1, to decrease the sympathetic tone, thereby increasing bone mass and decreasing energy expenditure. This study reveals that adiponectin has the unusual ability to regulate the same function in two opposite manners depending on where it acts and that it opposes, partially, leptin's influence on the sympathetic nervous system. It also proposes that adiponectin regulation of bone mass occurs through a PI3-kinase-FoxO1 pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Bone resorption by osteoclasts requires a large number of lysosomes that release proteases in the resorption lacuna. Whether lysosomal biogenesis is a consequence of the action of transcriptional regulators of osteoclast differentiation or is under the control of a different and specific transcriptional pathway remains unknown. We show here, through cell-based assays and cell-specific gene deletion experiments in mice, that the osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL promotes lysosomal biogenesis once osteoclasts are differentiated through the selective activation of TFEB, a member of the MITF/TFE family of transcription factors. This occurs following PKCβ phosphorylation of TFEB on three serine residues located in its last 15 amino acids. This post-translational modification stabilizes and increases the activity of this transcription factor. Supporting these biochemical observations, mice lacking in osteoclasts--either TFEB or PKCβ--show decreased lysosomal gene expression and increased bone mass. Altogether, these results uncover a RANKL-dependent signaling pathway taking place in differentiated osteoclasts and culminating in the activation of TFEB to enhance lysosomal biogenesis-a necessary step for proper bone resorption.",

        "Abstract": "The role of brain stem serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in autoresuscitation in neonatal life is unclear. We hypothesized that a specific loss of 5-HT would compromise gasping and autoresuscitation mainly in the second postnatal week and that acute restoration of 5-HT would reverse the defects. We exposed postnatal day (P)4-5, P8-9, and P11-12 tryptophan-hydroxylase-2 knockout (TPH2(-/-)) and wild-type littermates (WT) to 10 episodes of anoxia (97% N2, 3% CO2), measuring survival, gasp latency, gasp frequency (fB), and the time required to restore eupnea and heart rate. We also tested P8-9 TPH2(-/-) mice after restoring 5-HT with a single injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) 1-2 h before testing or with multiple injections beginning 24 h before testing. At P4-5 and P8-9, but not at P11-12, gasp latency and the recovery of eupnea were delayed ~2- to 3-fold in TPH2(-/-) pups compared with WT (P < 0.001). At all ages, TPH2(-/-) pups displayed reduced gasp fB (~20-30%; P < 0.001) and delayed heart rate recovery (~60%; P = 0.002) compared with WT littermates. TPH2(-/-) survival was reduced compared with WT (P < 0.001), especially at P8-9 and P11-12 (P = 0.004). Whereas 1-2 h of 5-HTP treatment improved the gasp latency and fB of P8-9 TPH2(-/-) pups, improved cardiorespiratory recovery and survival required 24 h of treatment. Our data suggest that 5-HT operates over a long time span (24 h) to improve survival during episodic severe hypoxia. Early in development (P4-9), 5-HT is critical for both respiratory and cardiovascular components of autoresuscitation; later (P11-12), it is critical mainly for cardiovascular components. Nevertheless, the effect of 5-HT deficiency on survival is most striking from P8 to P12.",

        "Abstract": "Early B-cell factor 1 (Ebf1) is a transcription factor whose inactivation in all cells results in high bone mass because of an increase in bone formation. This observation suggests Ebf1 may be an inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation. To test this contention, we analyzed Ebf1 pattern of expression and function in osteoblasts ex vivo and in vivo through osteoblast-specific inactivation in the mouse. We show here that in vivo deletion of Ebf1 in osteoblast progenitors does not affect osteoblast differentiation or bone formation accrual post-natally. These observations indicate that the phenotype described in Ebf1(-/)(-) mice is not osteoblast-autonomous.",

        "Abstract": "Impaired lung function caused by decreased airway diameter (bronchoconstriction) is frequently observed whether body weight is abnormally high or low. That these opposite conditions affect the airways similarly suggests that the regulation of airway diameter and body weight are intertwined. We show here that, independently of its regulation of appetite, melanocortin pathway, or sympathetic tone, leptin is necessary and sufficient to increase airway diameter by signaling through its cognate receptor in cholinergic neurons. The latter decreases parasympathetic signaling through the M(3) muscarinic receptor in airway smooth muscle cells, thereby increasing airway diameter without affecting local inflammation. Accordingly, decreasing parasympathetic tone genetically or pharmacologically corrects bronchoconstriction and normalizes lung function in obese mice regardless of bronchial inflammation. This study reveals an adipocyte-dependent regulation of bronchial diameter whose disruption contributes to the impaired lung function caused by abnormal body weight. These findings may be of use in the management of obesity-associated asthma.",

        "Abstract": "Energy release from cellular storage is mandatory for survival during fasting. This is achieved through lipolysis and liver gluconeogenesis. We show here that in the mouse, gut-derived serotonin (GDS) is upregulated during fasting and that it favors both mechanisms. In adipocytes, GDS signals through the Htr2b receptor to favor lipolysis by increasing phosphorylation and activity of hormone-sensitive lipase. In hepatocytes, GDS signaling through Htr2b promotes gluconeogenesis by enhancing activity of two rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzymes, FBPase and G6Pase. In addition, GDS signaling in hepatocytes prevents glucose uptake in a Glut2-dependent manner, thereby further favoring maintenance of blood glucose levels. As a result, inhibition of GDS synthesis can improve glucose intolerance caused by high-fat diet. Hence, GDS opposes deleterious consequences of food deprivation by favoring lipolysis and liver gluconeogenesis while preventing glucose uptake by hepatocytes. As a result, pharmacological inhibition of its synthesis may contribute to improve type 2 diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "A screen of microRNAs preferentially expressed in osteoblasts identified members of the miR-34 family as regulators of osteoblast proliferation and/or differentiation. Osteoblast-specific gain- and loss-of-function experiments performed in vivo revealed that miR-34b and -c affected skeletogenesis during embryonic development, as well as bone mass accrual after birth, through two complementary cellular and molecular mechanisms. First, they inhibited osteoblast proliferation by suppressing Cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6 accumulation. Second, they inhibited terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, at least in part through the inhibition of SATB2, a nuclear matrix protein that is a critical determinant of osteoblast differentiation. Genetic evidence obtained in the mouse confirmed the importance of SATB2 regulation by miR-34b/c. These results are the first to identify a family of microRNAs involved in bone formation in vivo and to identify a specific genetic pathway by which these microRNAs regulate osteoblast differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "It has long been known that sex steroid hormones regulate bone mass accrual. This observation raises the testable hypothesis that bone may in turn regulate the synthesis and secretion of sex steroid hormones in one or both genders. This hypothesis is comprised within a more general hypothesis that bone mass, energy metabolism, and reproduction are regulated coordinately. The identification of osteocalcin as an osteoblast-specific secreted molecule allows us to address this question in molecular terms. This review details how the regulation of male fertility by osteocalcin was unraveled, and how osteocalcin signaling in Leydig cells of the testis occurs. It also discusses the implication of this novel mode of regulation of testosterone synthesis observed in males but not in females.",

        "Title": "Sulfatases are determinants of alveolar formation.",
        "Abstract": "Alveolar formation or alveolarization is orchestrated by a finely regulated and complex interaction between growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins. The lung parenchyma contains various extracellular matrix proteins including proteoglycans, which are composed of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to a protein core. Although GAGs are known to regulate growth factor distribution and activity according to their degree of sulfation the role of sulfated GAG in the respiratory system is not well understood. The degree of sulfation of GAGs is regulated in part, by sulfatases that remove sulfate groups. In vertebrates, the enzyme Sulfatase-Modifying Factor 1 (Sumf1) activates all sulfatases. Here we utilized mice lacking Sumf1(-/-) to study the importance of proteoglycan desulfation in lung development. The Sumf1(-/-) mice have normal lungs up until the onset of alveolarization at post-natal day 5 (P5). We detected increased deposition of sulfated GAG throughout the lung parenchyma and a decrease in alveolar septa formation. Moreover, stereological analysis showed that the alveolar volume is 20% larger in Sumf1(-/-) as compared to wild type (WT) mice at P10 and P30. Additionally, pulmonary function test was consistent with increased alveolar volume. Genetic experiments demonstrate that in Sumf1(-/-) mice arrest of alveolarization is independent of fibroblast growth factor signaling. In turn, the Sumf1(-/-) mice have increased transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling and in vivo injection of TGFβ neutralizing antibody leads to normalization of alveolarization. Thus, absence of sulfatase activity increases sulfated GAG deposition in the lungs causing deregulation of TGFβ signaling and arrest of alveolarization.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin signaling in osteoblasts contributes to whole-body glucose homeostasis in the mouse and in humans by increasing the activity of osteocalcin. The osteoblast insulin signaling cascade is negatively regulated by ESP, a tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylating the insulin receptor. Esp is one of many tyrosine phosphatases expressed in osteoblasts, and this observation suggests that other protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) may contribute to the attenuation of insulin receptor phosphorylation in this cell type. In this study, we sought to identify an additional PTP(s) that, like ESP, would function in the osteoblast to regulate insulin signaling and thus affect activity of the insulin-sensitizing hormone osteocalcin. For that purpose, we used as criteria expression in osteoblasts, regulation by isoproterenol, and ability to trap the insulin receptor in a substrate-trapping assay. Here we show that the T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) regulates insulin receptor phosphorylation in the osteoblast, thus compromising bone resorption and bioactivity of osteocalcin. Accordingly, osteoblast-specific deletion of TC-PTP promotes insulin sensitivity in an osteocalcin-dependent manner. This study increases the number of genes involved in the bone regulation of glucose homeostasis.",

Historically, the hypothalamus has been viewed as the site for leptin signaling in the brain. Recent genetic studies, however, indicate that these physiological functions, notably the regulation of appetite and bone mass accrual by leptin, take place for the most part through inhibition of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) synthesis and release by brainstem neurons. Here, we review how these findings have redefined the roadmap of leptin signaling in the brain. This has led to proof-of-principle studies showing that selective inhibition of the leptin-serotonin axis is a viable therapeutic approach to treat appetite disorders.",

        "Abstract": "The uncarboxylated form of the osteoblast-specific secreted molecule osteocalcin is a hormone favoring glucose handling and increasing energy expenditure. As a result, the absence of osteocalcin leads to glucose intolerance in mice, while genetically modified mice with an increase in uncarboxylated osteocalcin are protected from type 2 diabetes and obesity. Here, we tested in the mouse the therapeutic potential of intermittent administration of osteocalcin. We found that daily injections of osteocalcin at either 3 or 30 ng/g/day significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice fed a normal diet. This was attributable, in part, to an increase in both β-cell mass and insulin secretion. When mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), daily injections of osteocalcin partially restored insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Moreover, mice treated with intermittent osteocalcin injections displayed additional mitochondria in their skeletal muscle, had increased energy expenditure and were protected from diet-induced obesity. Finally, the hepatic steatosis induced by the HFD was completely rescued in mice receiving osteocalcin daily. Overall, these results provide evidence that daily injections of osteocalcin can improve glucose handling and prevent the development of type 2 diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "The sympathetic nervous system, whose activity is regulated by leptin signaling in the brain, is a major regulator of bone mass accrual. To determine the identity of the cell type in which the sympathetic tone signals to inhibit bone mass accrual, we performed a systematic, cell-specific analysis of the function of the β2 adrenergic receptor (Adrβ2) and various genes implicated in the pathway in the mouse. This was followed by leptin intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion and bone histomorphometric analyses of bone parameters. We show that the sympathetic tone signals in the osteoblasts to inhibit CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein) phosphorylation and thus decrease osteoblast proliferation and to promote ATF4 phosphorylation and thus increase RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) expression, which then stimulates osteoclast differentiation. Leptin ICV infusion in various mouse models established that leptin-dependent inhibition of bone mass accrual relies on both transcriptional events taking place in osteoblasts. Thus, this study formally identifies the osteoblast as the major cell type in which the molecular events triggered by the sympathetic regulation of bone mass accrual take place. As such, it suggests that inhibiting sympathetic signaling could be beneficial in the treatment of low bone mass conditions.",

        "Abstract": "The past five years have witnessed the emergence and discovery of unexpected functions played by the skeleton in whole-organism physiology. Among these newly described tasks is the role of bone in the control of energy metabolism, which is achieved through the secretion of osteocalcin, an osteoblasts-derived hormone regulating insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, and energy expenditure. These initial findings raised several fundamental questions on the nature of insulin action in bone. Discoveries made independently by our two groups have provided answers recently to some of these questions. Through the analysis of mice lacking insulin receptor (InsR) only in osteoblasts, we found that insulin signaling in these cells favors whole-body glucose homeostasis. Importantly, this function of insulin signaling in osteoblasts was achieved through the negative regulation of osteocalcin carboxylation and bioavailability. Our studies also established that insulin signaling in osteoblasts was a positive regulator not only of postnatal bone acquisition but also of bone resorption. Interestingly, it appears that insulin signaling in osteoblasts induced osteocalcin activation by stimulating osteoclast activity. Indeed, the low pH generated during bone resorption is a sufficient means to decarboxylate osteocalcin. Our findings establish that the osteoblast is an important target used by insulin to control whole-body glucose homeostasis and identify bone resorption as the mechanism regulating osteocalcin activation.",

        "Abstract": "Interactions between bone and the reproductive system have until now been thought to be limited to the regulation of bone remodeling by the gonads. We now show that, in males, bone acts as a regulator of fertility. Using coculture assays, we demonstrate that osteoblasts are able to induce testosterone production by the testes, though they fail to influence estrogen production by the ovaries. Analyses of cell-specific loss- and gain-of-function models reveal that the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin performs this endocrine function. By binding to a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in the Leydig cells of the testes, osteocalcin regulates in a CREB-dependent manner the expression of enzymes that is required for testosterone synthesis, promoting germ cell survival. This study expands the physiological repertoire of osteocalcin and provides the first evidence that the skeleton is an endocrine regulator of reproduction.",

        "Abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that leptin regulates appetite and energy expenditure, at least in part by inhibiting serotonin synthesis and release from brainstem neurons. To demonstrate that this pathway works postnatally, we used a conditional, brainstem-specific mouse CreER(T2) driver to show that leptin signals in brainstem neurons after birth to decrease appetite by inhibiting serotonin synthesis. Cell-specific gene deletion experiments and intracerebroventricular leptin infusions reveal that serotonin signals in arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus through the Htr1a receptor to favor food intake and that this serotonin function requires the expression of Creb, which regulates the expression of several genes affecting appetite. Accordingly, a specific antagonist of the Htr1a receptor decreases food intake in leptin-deficient but not in Htr1a(-/-) mice. Collectively, these results establish that leptin inhibition of serotonin is necessary to inhibit appetite postnatally and provide a proof of principle that selective inhibition of this pathway may be a viable option to treat appetite disorders.",

The existence of this coordinated regulation is motivated by the energetic needs of the skeleton; therefore, this regulation relies on hormones that appear during evolution with the skeleton, not with energy metabolism. Leptin is such a hormone, and it is a critical regulator of bone mass as well as of appetite and energy expenditure. This review goes over the anatomical route and molecular pathways used by leptin to inhibit both bone mass accrual and appetite through its signaling in the brain.",

        "Abstract": "Serotonin is a bioamine regulating bone mass accrual differently depending on its site of synthesis. It decreases accrual when synthesized in the gut, and increases it when synthesized in the brain. The signal transduction events elicited by gut-derived serotonin once it binds to the Htr1b receptor present on osteoblasts have been identified and culminate in cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) regulation of osteoblast proliferation. In contrast, we do not know how brain-derived serotonin favors bone mass accrual following its binding to the Htr2c receptor on neurons of the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMH). We show here--through gene expression analysis, serotonin treatment of wild-type and Htr2c(-/-) hypothalamic explants, and cell-specific gene deletion in the mouse--that, following its binding to the Htr2c receptor on VMH neurons, serotonin uses a calmodulin kinase (CaMK)-dependent signaling cascade involving CaMKKβ and CaMKIV to decrease the sympathetic tone and increase bone mass accrual. We further show that the transcriptional mediator of these events is CREB, whose phosphorylation on Ser 133 is increased by CaMKIV following serotonin treatment of hypothalamic explants. A microarray experiment identified two genes necessary for optimum sympathetic activity whose expression is regulated by CREB. These results provide a molecular understanding of how serotonin signals in hypothalamic neurons to regulate bone mass accrual and identify CREB as a critical determinant of this function, although through different mechanisms depending on the cell type, neuron, or osteoblast in which it is expressed.",

It is synthesized by two different genes at two different sites, and, surprisingly, plays antagonistic functions on bone mass accrual at these two sites.

        "Abstract": "During the last 20 years, the emergence of sophisticated genetic tools has extraordinarily improved our understanding of a large number of physiological functions, among which the physiology of the skeleton. Bone, recently described as an endocrine organ, has the ability to constantly renew itself through bone remodeling, which requires a constant supply of energy. Hence, we hypothesized that there must be a coregulation of bone mass and energy metabolism, and focused on leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, which regulates both energy metabolism and bone remodeling through a central relay. Through a careful analysis of leptin neuronal targets, we unraveled that leptin regulation of bone mass occurs indirectly by inhibiting serotonin release and synthesis in neurons of the brainstem. Surprisingly, we observed that the other pool of serotonin, produced in enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum, negatively regulates bone mass accrual. Thus, serotonin is a molecule with two distinct functional identities depending on its site of synthesis. Finally, a recent study provides a proof of principle that inhibiting gut-derived serotonin (GDS) biosynthesis could become a new anabolic treatment for osteoporosis. double dagger.",

        "Abstract": "The broad expression of the insulin receptor suggests that the spectrum of insulin function has not been fully described. A cell type expressing this receptor is the osteoblast, a bone-specific cell favoring glucose metabolism through a hormone, osteocalcin, that becomes active once uncarboxylated. We show here that insulin signaling in osteoblasts is necessary for whole-body glucose homeostasis because it increases osteocalcin activity. To achieve this function insulin signaling in osteoblasts takes advantage of the regulation of osteoclastic bone resorption exerted by osteoblasts. Indeed, since bone resorption occurs at a pH acidic enough to decarboxylate proteins, osteoclasts determine the carboxylation status and function of osteocalcin. Accordingly, increasing or decreasing insulin signaling in osteoblasts promotes or hampers glucose metabolism in a bone resorption-dependent manner in mice and humans. Hence, in a feed-forward loop, insulin signals in osteoblasts activate a hormone, osteocalcin, that promotes glucose metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Osteocalcin was recently identified as an osteoblast-secreted hormone regulating insulin secretion and sensitivity. In mice and humans, osteocalcin can be present in the serum in carboxylated or undercarboxylated forms and it has been shown that it is the undercarboxylated form of osteocalcin which acts as a hormone. The study of osteocalcin different circulating forms in mouse serum, however, has been hampered by the absence of quantitative methodology. Here we described a triple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system for quantification of mouse total, carboxylated and uncarboxylated osteocalcin. That carboxylation of osteocalcin was decreased in mouse osteoblasts cultures treated with warfarin, an inhibitor of carboxylation validated this assay. This ELISA could also detect elevated levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin in the serum of mice treated with warfarin and in the serum of Esp -/- mice, a mouse model known to have more undercarboxylated, i.e., active osteocalcin. These results show that this new ELISA system is a reliable method to assess carboxylation status of osteocalcin in cell culture supernatants as well as in mouse serum. Its use should facilitate the analysis of culture system or mouse model in which the hormonal activity of osteocalcin needs to be evaluated.",

This aspect of sympathetic nervous system function raises the prospect that the other arm of the autonomic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, may also affect bone remodeling. Here, we use various mutant mouse strains, each lacking one of the muscarinic receptors that mediate parasympathetic activity, to show that the parasympathetic nervous system acting through the M(3) muscarinic receptor is a positive regulator of bone mass accrual, increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. Gene expression studies, cell-specific gene deletion experiments, and analysis of compound mutant mice showed that the parasympathetic nervous system favors bone mass accrual by acting centrally and by decreasing the sympathetic tone.

To fulfill these two functions leptin requires the integrity of hypothalamic neurons but not the expression of its receptor, ObRb on these neurons. These results suggested that leptin acts first elsewhere in the brain to mediate these functions. However, this neuroanatomical site of leptin action in the brain remained elusive. Recent mouse genetic, electrophysiological and neuroanatomical studies provide evidence that leptin inhibits appetite and bone mass accrual through a two-step pathway: it decreases synthesis and the release by brainstem neurons of serotonin that in turn targets hypothalamic neurons to regulate appetite and bone mass accrual.",

        "Abstract": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays an essential role in regulating calcium and bone homeostasis in the adult, but whether PTH is required at all for regulating fetal-placental mineral homeostasis and skeletal development is uncertain. We hypothesized that despite its low circulating levels during fetal life, PTH plays a critical role in regulating these processes. To address this, we examined two different genetic models of PTH deficiency. Pth null mice have enlarged parathyroids that are incapable of making PTH, whereas Gcm2 null mice lack parathyroids but have PTH that arises from the thymus. Pth nulls served as a model of complete absence of PTH, whereas Gcm2 nulls were a model of severe hypoparathyroidism. We determined that PTH contributes importantly to fetal mineral homeostasis because in its absence a fetal hypoparathyroid phenotype results with hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, low amniotic fluid mineral content, and reduced skeletal mineral content. We also determined that PTH is expressed in the placenta, regulates the placental expression of genes involved in calcium and other solute transfer, and may directly stimulate placental calcium transfer. Although parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) acts in concert with PTH to regulate fetal mineral homeostasis and placental calcium transfer, unlike PTH, it does not upregulate in response to fetal hypocalcemia.",

        "Abstract": "Our work focuses on genetic and molecular mechanisms for the reciprocal regulation of bone and energy metabolism orchestrated by leptin and osteocalcin. In the context of this reciprocal regulation, the finding that leptin inhibits insulin secretion by beta cells while osteocalcin favors it is surprising. In exploring the molecular bases of this paradox we found that leptin, as is the case for most of its functions, uses a neuronal relay to inhibit insulin secretion. Cell-specific gene-deletion experiments revealed that a component of this neuronal regulation is the sympathetic innervation to osteoblasts. Under the control of leptin the sympathetic tone favors expression in osteoblasts of Esp, which inhibits the metabolic activity of osteocalcin. We further identify ATF4 as a transcription factor that regulates Esp expression and thereby insulin secretion and sensitivity. Taken together these data illustrate the tight connections between bone remodeling and energy metabolism and add further credence to the notion that the osteoblast is a bona fide endocrine cell type.",

        "Abstract": "Leptin inhibition of bone mass accrual requires the integrity of specific hypothalamic neurons but not expression of its receptor on these neurons. The same is true for its regulation of appetite and energy expenditure. This suggests that leptin acts elsewhere in the brain to achieve these three functions. We show here that brainstem-derived serotonin (BDS) favors bone mass accrual following its binding to Htr2c receptors on ventromedial hypothalamic neurons and appetite via Htr1a and 2b receptors on arcuate neurons. Leptin inhibits these functions and increases energy expenditure because it reduces serotonin synthesis and firing of serotonergic neurons. Accordingly, while abrogating BDS synthesis corrects the bone, appetite and energy expenditure phenotypes caused by leptin deficiency, inactivation of the leptin receptor in serotonergic neurons recapitulates them fully. This study modifies the map of leptin signaling in the brain and identifies a molecular basis for the common regulation of bone and energy metabolisms.

        "Title": "The transcription factor ATF4 regulates glucose metabolism in mice through its expression in osteoblasts.",
        "Abstract": "The recent demonstration that osteoblasts have a role in controlling energy metabolism suggests that they express cell-specific regulatory genes involved in this process. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a transcription factor that accumulates predominantly in osteoblasts, where it regulates virtually all functions linked to the maintenance of bone mass. Since Atf4-/- mice have smaller fat pads than littermate controls, we investigated whether ATF4 also influences energy metabolism. Here, we have shown, through analysis of Atf4-/- mice, that ATF4 inhibits insulin secretion and decreases insulin sensitivity in liver, fat, and muscle. Several lines of evidence indicated that this function of ATF4 occurred through its osteoblastic expression. First, insulin sensitivity is enhanced in the liver of Atf4-/- mice, but not in cultured hepatocytes from these mice. Second, mice overexpressing ATF4 in osteoblasts only [termed here alpha1(I)Collagen-Atf4 mice] displayed a decrease in insulin secretion and were insulin insensitive. Third, the alpha1(I)Collagen-Atf4 transgene corrected the energy metabolism phenotype of Atf4-/- mice. Fourth, and more definitely, mice lacking ATF4 only in osteoblasts presented the same metabolic abnormalities as Atf4-/- mice. Molecularly, ATF4 favored expression in osteoblasts of Esp, which encodes a product that decreases the bioactivity of osteocalcin, an osteoblast-specific secreted molecule that enhances secretion of and sensitivity to insulin. These results provide a transcriptional basis to the observation that osteoblasts fulfill endocrine functions and identify ATF4 as a regulator of most functions of osteoblasts.",

        "Abstract": "Thanks to integrative physiology, new relationships between organs and homeostatic functions have emerged. This approach to physiology based on a whole organism approach has allowed the bone field to make fundamental progress. In the last decade, clinical observations and scientific evidences in vivo have uncovered that fat with leptin controls bone mass through brain including a hypothalamic relay and sympathetic nervous system. The finding that energy metabolism affects bone remodelling suggested that in an endocrine perspective, a feedback loop should exist. Beside its classical functions, bone can now be considered as a true endocrine organ secreting osteocalcin, a hormone pharmacologically active on glucose and fat metabolism. Indeed osteocalcin stimulates insulin secretion and beta-cell proliferation. Simultaneously, osteocalcin acts on adipocytes to induce Adiponectin which secondarily reduce insulin resistance. This cross regulation between bone and energy metabolism offers novel therapeutic targets in type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis.",

        "Abstract": "The osteoblast-secreted molecule osteocalcin favors insulin secretion, but how this function is regulated in vivo by extracellular signals is for now unknown. In this study, we show that leptin, which instead inhibits insulin secretion, partly uses the sympathetic nervous system to fulfill this function. Remarkably, for our purpose, an osteoblast-specific ablation of sympathetic signaling results in a leptin-dependent hyperinsulinemia. In osteoblasts, sympathetic tone stimulates expression of Esp, a gene inhibiting the activity of osteocalcin, which is an insulin secretagogue. Accordingly, Esp inactivation doubles hyperinsulinemia and delays glucose intolerance in ob/ob mice, whereas Osteocalcin inactivation halves their hyperinsulinemia. By showing that leptin inhibits insulin secretion by decreasing osteocalcin bioactivity, this study illustrates the importance of the relationship existing between fat and skeleton for the regulation of glucose homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "The leptin regulation of bone remodeling, which has been documented through studies of loss-of-function mutations of this hormone or of its receptor in mice and humans, still raised several unanswered questions. For instance, it has been assumed but not formally demonstrated that this regulation occurs through neuronal means. Likewise, it has not been possible until now to dissociate the influence leptin exerts on appetite and energy expenditure from this function. We show here through mouse genetic studies that a deletion of the leptin receptor in neurons results in an increase in bone formation and bone resorption, resulting in a high bone mass as seen in leptin-deficient mice. In contrast, the same deletion in osteoblasts only does not influence bone remodeling. Furthermore, through the use of l/l mice, a model of gain of function in leptin signaling harboring a Y985L substitution in the leptin receptor, we show that leptin signaling inhibits bone mass accrual by up-regulating sympathetic activity independently of any change in appetite or energy expenditure. This work establishes that in vivo leptin regulates bone mass accrual by acting through neuronal means and provides a direct demonstration that this function of leptin can occur independently of its regulation of energy metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Loss- and gain-of-function mutations in the broadly expressed gene Lrp5 affect bone formation, causing osteoporosis and high bone mass, respectively. Although Lrp5 is viewed as a Wnt coreceptor, osteoblast-specific disruption of beta-Catenin does not affect bone formation. Instead, we show here that Lrp5 inhibits expression of Tph1, the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme for serotonin in enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum. Accordingly, decreasing serotonin blood levels normalizes bone formation and bone mass in Lrp5-deficient mice, and gut- but not osteoblast-specific Lrp5 inactivation decreases bone formation in a beta-Catenin-independent manner. Moreover, gut-specific activation of Lrp5, or inactivation of Tph1, increases bone mass and prevents ovariectomy-induced bone loss. Serotonin acts on osteoblasts through the Htr1b receptor and CREB to inhibit their proliferation. By identifying duodenum-derived serotonin as a hormone inhibiting bone formation in an Lrp5-dependent manner, this study broadens our understanding of bone remodeling and suggests potential therapies to increase bone mass.",

Accordingly, lysosomal dysfunctions are often associated with impaired autophagy. We demonstrated that inactivation of the sulfatase modifying factor 1 gene (Sumf1), a gene mutated in multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), causes glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to accumulate in lysosomes, which in turn disrupts autophagy. We utilized a murine model of MSD to study how impairment of this process affects chondrocyte viability and thus skeletal development.",

GAGs desulfation, a necessary step for their degradation, is exerted by sulfatases that are activated by another enzyme, Sulfatase-Modifying Factor 1 (SUMF1), whose inactivation in humans leads to severe skeletal abnormalities. We show here that despite being expressed in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes Sumf1 does not affect osteoblast differentiation. Conversely, in chondrocytes it favors ECM production and autophagy and promotes proliferation and differentiation by limiting FGF signaling. Thus, proteoglycan desulfation is a critical regulator of chondrogenesis.",

Our understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms that lead to cell differentiation along these three lineages has increased considerably in the past ten years. In the case of chondrocytes and osteoblasts advances have been made possible largely through the molecular elucidation of human skeletal dysplasias. This review discusses the key transcription factors that regulate skeletogenesis and highlights their function, mode of action, and regulation by other factors, with a special emphasis on how human genetics has contributed to this knowledge.",

        "Abstract": "Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is one of the two known mediators of the leptin regulation of bone mass. Cart is expressed in both the brain and peripheral tissues such as the pituitary gland and the pancreatic islets. Cart(-/-) mice present a low bone mass phenotype due to an isolated increase in osteoclast number. In an effort to rescue their bone phenotype, we delivered recombinant CART in the third ventricle of the mutant mice but never recorded any improvement of the low bone mass, although this procedure could affect fat pad mass. In contrast, transgenic mice harboring a 2-fold increase in CART circulating level display a high bone mass due to an isolated decrease in osteoclast number and could rescue the low bone mass phenotype of the Cart(-/-) mice. Thus, our results suggest that in its capacity of a regulator of bone remodeling, CART may act more as a circulating molecule than a neuropeptide.",

        "Abstract": "The osteoblast-specific secreted molecule osteocalcin behaves as a hormone regulating glucose metabolism and fat mass in two mutant mouse strains. Here, we ask two questions: is the action of osteocalcin on beta cells and adipocytes elicited by the same concentrations of the molecule, and more importantly, does osteocalcin regulate energy metabolism in WT mice? Cell-based assays using isolated pancreatic islets, a beta cell line, and primary adipocytes showed that picomolar amounts of osteocalcin are sufficient to regulate the expression of the insulin genes and beta cell proliferation markers, whereas nanomolar amounts affect adiponectin and Pgc1alpha expression in white and brown adipocytes, respectively. In vivo the same difference exists in osteocalcin's ability to regulate glucose metabolism on the one hand and affect insulin sensitivity and fat mass on the other hand. Furthermore, we show that long-term treatment of WT mice with osteocalcin can significantly weaken the deleterious effect on body mass and glucose metabolism of gold thioglucose-induced hyperphagia and high-fat diet. These results establish in WT mice the importance of this novel molecular player in the regulation of glucose metabolism and fat mass and suggest that osteocalcin may be of value in the treatment of metabolic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The regulation of bone remodeling by an adipocyte-derived hormone implies that bone may exert a feedback control of energy homeostasis. To test this hypothesis we looked for genes expressed in osteoblasts, encoding signaling molecules and affecting energy metabolism. We show here that mice lacking the protein tyrosine phosphatase OST-PTP are hypoglycemic and are protected from obesity and glucose intolerance because of an increase in beta-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. In contrast, mice lacking the osteoblast-secreted molecule osteocalcin display decreased beta-cell proliferation, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Removing one Osteocalcin allele from OST-PTP-deficient mice corrects their metabolic phenotype. Ex vivo, osteocalcin can stimulate CyclinD1 and Insulin expression in beta-cells and Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, in adipocytes; in vivo osteocalcin can improve glucose tolerance. By revealing that the skeleton exerts an endocrine regulation of sugar homeostasis this study expands the biological importance of this organ and our understanding of energy metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "FILAMIN B, which encodes a cytoplasmic actin binding protein, is mutated in several skeletal dysplasias. To further investigate how an actin binding protein influences skeletogenesis, we generated mice lacking intact Filamin B. As observed in spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome patients, Filamin B mutant mice display ectopic mineralization in many cartilaginous elements. This aberrant mineralization is due to ectopic chondrocyte hypertrophy similar to that seen in mice expressing Runx2 in chondrocytes. Accordingly, removing one copy of Runx2 rescues the Filamin B mutant phenotype, indicating that Filamin B is a regulator of Runx2 function during chondrocyte differentiation. Filamin B binds Smad3, which is known to interact with Runx2. Smad3 phosphorylation is increased in the mutant mice. Thus, Filamin B inhibits Runx2 activity, at least in part, through the Smad3 pathway. Our results uncover the involvement of actin binding proteins during chondrogenesis and provide a molecular basis to a human genetic disease.",

        "Abstract": "Bone remodeling requires osteoblasts and osteoclasts working in concert to maintain a constant bone mass. The dysregulation of signaling pathways that affect osteoblast or osteoclast differentiation or function leads to either osteopenia or high bone mass. The discovery that activating and inactivating mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5, a putative Wnt coreceptor, led to high bone mass and low bone mass in human beings, respectively, generated a tremendous amount of interest in the possible role of the Wnt signaling pathway in the regulation of bone remodeling. A number of mouse models have been generated to study a collection of Wnt signaling molecules that have been identified as regulators of bone mass. These mouse models help establish the canonical Wnt signaling pathway as a major regulator of chondrogenesis, osteoblastogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis. This review will summarize these advances.",

        "Abstract": "Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of soft tissue calcification, and Mgp gene deletion in mice results in arterial calcification. Our aim was to examine osteopontin (OPN) expression and localization, and posttranslational processing of OPN by the crosslinking enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2), in the calcified aorta of Mgp-deficient (Mgp(-/-)) mice. Using immunohistochemistry and light and electron microscopy, we report that following mineralization occurring in the arterial media of Mgp(-/-) aortas, OPN is upregulated and accumulates at the surface of the calcified elastic lamellae. Macrophages were observed in direct contact with this OPN-rich layer. Western blot analysis of extracted Mgp(-/-) aortas revealed that the majority of the OPN was in high molecular mass protein complexes, indicating modification by a crosslinking enzyme. Consistent with this observation, TG2 expression and gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysyl crosslink levels were also increased in Mgp(-/-) aortas. In addition to the mineral-inhibiting actions of OPN, and based on data linking OPN and TG2 with cell adhesion in various cell types including monocytes and macrophages, we propose that TG2 interactions with OPN lead to protein polymerization that facilitates macrophage adhesion to the calcified elastic lamellae to promote clearance of the ectopic mineral deposits.",

        "Abstract": "The transcription factor ATF4 enhances bone formation by favoring amino acid import and collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, a function requiring its phosphorylation by RSK2, the kinase inactivated in Coffin-Lowry Syndrome. Here, we show that in contrast, RSK2 activity, ATF4-dependent collagen synthesis, and bone formation are increased in mice lacking neurofibromin in osteoblasts (Nf1(ob)(-/-) mice). Independently of RSK2, ATF4 phosphorylation by PKA is enhanced in Nf1(ob)(-/-) mice, thereby increasing Rankl expression, osteoclast differentiation, and bone resorption. In agreement with ATF4 function in amino acid transport, a low-protein diet decreased bone protein synthesis and normalized bone formation and bone mass in Nf1(ob)(-/-) mice without affecting other organ weight, while a high-protein diet overcame Atf4(-/-) and Rsk2(-/-) mice developmental defects, perinatal lethality, and low bone mass. By showing that ATF4-dependent skeletal dysplasiae are treatable by dietary manipulations, this study reveals a molecular connection between nutrition and skeletal development.",

        "Abstract": "The perichondrium, a structure made of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells surrounding growth plate cartilage, regulates chondrocyte maturation through poorly understood mechanisms. Analyses of loss- and gain-of-function models show that Twist-1, whose expression in cartilage is restricted to perichondrium, favors chondrocyte maturation in a Runx2-dependent manner. Runx2, in turn, enhances perichondrial expression of Fgf18, a regulator of chondrocyte maturation. Accordingly, compound heterozygous embryos for Runx2 and Fgf18 deletion display the same chondrocyte maturation phenotype as Fgf18-null embryos. This study identifies a transcriptional basis for the inhibition of chondrocyte maturation by perichondrium and reveals that Runx2 fulfills antagonistic functions during chondrogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Collagen V is a quantitatively minor component of collagen I fibrils and the defective product of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). To provide new insights into its embryonic function, a continuous evaluation of the expression pattern of proalpha1(V), a chain common to all collagen V molecular forms, was performed by in situ hybridization of developing mouse from 7.5 days after conception (dpc) to birth. Proalpha1(V) transcripts were first detected at 8.5 dpc, signals being considerably augmented at 16.5 dpc and declining at birth. Hybridization signals were, at first, exclusively detected in the dorsal aorta wall, heart, and adnexa. At 10.5 dpc, col5a1 expression was found in the heart, dorsal aorta wall, branchial arches, mesonephrotic tubules, and intestinal mesenchyme and coincided with proalpha1(I) developmental expression. Later stages exhibited an intense signal in more restricted regions, notably the skin, the bones and vertebral column, the cornea, the tendons and ligaments, the peritoneal membranes, the umbilical cord, and the salivary gland. The data revealed the important contribution of collagen V to the development of functional connective tissues. Proalpha1(V) signals were exclusively detected in the flattened cells of the surface ectoderm at 10.5 dpc. By 12.5 dpc, when cells had become cuboidal, the signal switched to the dermal fibroblasts. Thus, type V collagen appears to contribute to epidermis differentiation. Our data also suggest that collagen V participates in bone formation and/or mineralization and in the renewal of stromal cells in the cornea. The results underscore the role of collagen V in developing embryos and provide important clues for analyzing the phenotype of mouse models for EDS.",

        "Abstract": "Mice with circadian gene Period and Cryptochrome mutations develop high bone mass early in life. Such a phenotype is accompanied by an increase in osteoblast numbers in mutant bone and cannot be corrected by leptin intracerebroventricular infusion. Thus, the molecular clock plays a key role in leptin-mediated sympathetic regulation of bone formation. Indeed, we found that leptin-dependent sympathetic signaling induces the expression of AP1 and circadian genes in bone and in osteoblasts with similar kinetics, and these two pathways play opposite roles in controlling c-myc expression. Mutations in the Period 1 and 2 genes result in uncontrolled c-myc signaling, overexpression of G1 cyclins, and increased osteoblast proliferation and bone-formation parameters. These results indicate that the role of leptin-dependent sympathetic signaling in bone formation is achieved through regulating two antagonistic pathways in osteoblasts.",

Cellular and molecular studies showed that beta-catenin together with TCF proteins regulates in osteoblasts the expression of Osteoprotegerin, a major inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation.

        "Abstract": "Osteoporosis is a common, prevalent, and debilitating condition, particularly in postmenopausal women. Genetics play a major role in determining peak bone mass and fracture risk, but few genes have been demonstrated conclusively to be involved, much less the signaling pathways with which they are affiliated. The identification of mutations in the gene Lrp5, a Wnt coreceptor, as the cause for both osteoporotic and high-bone mass disorders implicated the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in bone mass regulation. Since Lrp5, other Wnt components have been identified as being regulators of bone mass, and Wnt target genes affecting bone homeostasis have begun to be elucidated. This chapter looks at the various components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and the data indicating that this pathway plays a major role in the control of both bone formation and bone resorption, the two key aspects of bone remodeling.",

        "Title": "Cart overexpression is the only identifiable cause of high bone mass in melanocortin 4 receptor deficiency.",
        "Abstract": "The neural regulation of bone remodeling has proven to be increasingly complex at the molecular level because it involves both positive and negative mediators of bone formation and resorption. One of the mediators expressed in hypothalamic neurons that leptin uses to inhibit osteoclast differentiation and thereby bone resorption is cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). CART expression in the hypothalamus is increased in mice lacking melanocortin 4 receptor (Mc4r(-/-) mice). Moreover, we show here that humans or mice lacking only one allele of Mc4r display a decrease in bone resorption parameters, high bone mass, and an increase in CART serum levels and/or hypothalamic expression. To demonstrate that the Cart overexpression is the only identifiable cause for the high bone mass observed upon Mc4r inactivation, we removed one allele of Cart from mice either heterozygous or homozygous for Mc4r inactivation. This manipulation sufficed to either significantly improve or normalize bone resorption parameters, without improving the energy metabolism disturbance that characterizes Mc4r-deficient mice. These results identify CART signaling as the main if not only molecular pathway accounting for the decrease in bone resorption leading to high bone mass in mice and humans deficient in Mc4r. As importantly, they also indicate that CART regulates bone resorption independently of the role it may exert in energy metabolism, suggesting that the neural control of appetite and bone remodeling are independent of each other.",

        "Title": "The molecular clock mediates leptin-regulated bone formation.",
        "Abstract": "The hormone leptin is a regulator of bone remodeling, a homeostatic function maintaining bone mass constant. Mice lacking molecular-clock components (Per and Cry), or lacking Per genes in osteoblasts, display high bone mass, suggesting that bone remodeling may also be subject to circadian regulation. Moreover, Per-deficient mice experience a paradoxical increase in bone mass following leptin intracerebroventricular infusion. Thus, clock genes may mediate the leptin-dependent sympathetic regulation of bone formation. We show that expression of clock genes in osteoblasts is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system and leptin. Clock genes mediate the antiproliferative function of sympathetic signaling by inhibiting G1 cyclin expression. Partially antagonizing this inhibitory loop, leptin also upregulates AP-1 gene expression, which promotes cyclin D1 expression, osteoblast proliferation, and bone formation. Thus, leptin determines the extent of bone formation by modulating, via sympathetic signaling, osteoblast proliferation through two antagonistic pathways, one of which involves the molecular clock.",

        "Abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization is a physiological process in bone and a pathological one in soft tissues. The mechanisms determining the spatial restriction of ECM mineralization to bone physiologically are poorly understood. Here we show that a normal extracellular phosphate concentration is required for bone mineralization, while lowering this concentration prevents mineralization of any ECM. However, simply raising extracellular phosphate concentration is not sufficient to induce pathological mineralization, this is because of the presence in all ECMs of pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of mineralization. ECM mineralization occurs only in bone because of the exclusive coexpression in osteoblasts of Type I collagen and Tnap, an enzyme that cleaves pyrophosphate. This dual requirement explains why Tnap ectopic expression in cells producing fibrillar collagen is sufficient to induce pathological mineralization. This study reveals that coexpression in osteoblasts of otherwise broadly expressed genes is necessary and sufficient to induce bone mineralization and provides evidence that pathological mineralization can be prevented by modulating extracellular phosphate concentration.",

        "Title": "Leptin regulation of bone resorption by the sympathetic nervous system and CART.",
        "Abstract": "Bone remodelling, the mechanism by which vertebrates regulate bone mass, comprises two phases, namely resorption by osteoclasts and formation by osteoblasts; osteoblasts are multifunctional cells also controlling osteoclast differentiation. Sympathetic signalling via beta2-adrenergic receptors (Adrb2) present on osteoblasts controls bone formation downstream of leptin. Here we show, by analysing Adrb2-deficient mice, that the sympathetic nervous system favours bone resorption by increasing expression in osteoblast progenitor cells of the osteoclast differentiation factor Rankl. This sympathetic function requires phosphorylation (by protein kinase A) of ATF4, a cell-specific CREB-related transcription factor essential for osteoblast differentiation and function. That bone resorption cannot increase in gonadectomized Adrb2-deficient mice highlights the biological importance of this regulation, but also contrasts sharply with the increase in bone resorption characterizing another hypogonadic mouse with low sympathetic tone, the ob/ob mouse. This discrepancy is explained, in part, by the fact that CART ('cocaine amphetamine regulated transcript'), a neuropeptide whose expression is controlled by leptin and nearly abolished in ob/ob mice, inhibits bone resorption by modulating Rankl expression. Our study establishes that leptin-regulated neural pathways control both aspects of bone remodelling, and demonstrates that integrity of sympathetic signalling is necessary for the increase in bone resorption caused by gonadal failure.",

        "Abstract": "Based on the analysis of a loss-of-function model, we recently showed that ATF4 regulates osteoblast terminal differentiation and function and is implicated in the pathophysiology of Coffin-Lowry syndrome. That study, however, did not address whether forced expression of Atf4 in non-osteoblastic cells would lead to osteoblast-specific gene expression, one of the most important features of a cell differentiation factor. To address this question we searched for cell lines that would not express Atf4. Contrasting with the restricted pattern of its protein accumulation, Atf4 mRNA was found in all cell lines and mouse tissues tested. Treatment of non-osteoblastic cells with MG115, a proteasome inhibitor, induced ATF4 accumulation and resulted in activation of an Osteocalcin promoter luciferase construct as well as expression of endogenous Osteocalcin, a molecular marker of differentiated osteoblasts and a target gene of ATF4. Eliminating the expression of beta-TrCP1, an ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase interacting with ATF4 by RNA interference, led to ATF4 accumulation and to endogenous Osteocalcin expression in fibroblasts. These results indicate that the absence of ATF4 in most cell types is determined, at least in part, by an ubiquitination-dependent process. To our knowledge ATF4 is the first cell-specific transcription factor in which cell-specific distribution is achieved post-translationally. This study also establishes that ATF4, like other osteoblast differentiation factors, such as Runx2 and Osterix, has the ability to induce osteoblast-specific gene expression in non-osteoblastic cells.",

        "Abstract": "Extracellular matrix mineralization (ECMM) is a physiologic process in the skeleton and in teeth and a pathologic one in other organs. The molecular mechanisms controlling ECMM are poorly understood. Inactivation of Matrix gla protein (Mgp) revealed that MGP is an inhibitor of ECMM. The fact that MGP is present in the general circulation raises the question of whether ECMM is regulated locally and/or systemically. Here, we show that restoration of Mgp expression in arteries rescues the arterial mineralization phenotype of Mgp-/- mice, whereas its expression in osteoblasts prevents bone mineralization. In contrast, raising the serum level of MGP does not affect mineralization of any ECM. In vivo mutagenesis experiments show that the anti-ECMM function of MGP requires four amino acids which are gamma-carboxylated (gla residues). Surprisingly, another gla protein specific to bone and teeth (osteocalcin) does not display the anti-ECMM function of MGP. These results indicate that ECMM is regulated locally in animals and uncover a striking disparity of function between proteins sharing identical structural motifs.",

        "Abstract": "Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS) is an X-linked mental retardation condition associated with skeletal abnormalities. The gene mutated in CLS, RSK2, encodes a growth factor-regulated kinase. However, the cellular and molecular bases of the skeletal abnormalities associated with CLS remain unknown. Here, we show that RSK2 is required for osteoblast differentiation and function. We identify the transcription factor ATF4 as a critical substrate of RSK2 that is required for the timely onset of osteoblast differentiation, for terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, and for osteoblast-specific gene expression. Additionally, RSK2 and ATF4 posttranscriptionally regulate the synthesis of Type I collagen, the main constituent of the bone matrix. Accordingly, Atf4-deficiency results in delayed bone formation during embryonic development and low bone mass throughout postnatal life. These findings identify ATF4 as a critical regulator of osteoblast differentiation and function, and indicate that lack of ATF4 phosphorylation by RSK2 may contribute to the skeletal phenotype of CLS.",

        "Abstract": "Runx2 is necessary and sufficient for osteoblast differentiation, yet its expression precedes the appearance of osteoblasts by 4 days. Here we show that Twist proteins transiently inhibit Runx2 function during skeletogenesis. Twist-1 and -2 are expressed in Runx2-expressing cells throughout the skeleton early during development, and osteoblast-specific gene expression occurs only after their expression decreases. Double heterozygotes for Twist-1 and Runx2 deletion have none of the skull abnormalities observed in Runx2(+/-) mice, a Twist-2 null background rescues the clavicle phenotype of Runx2(+/-) mice, and Twist-1 or -2 deficiency leads to premature osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, Twist-1 overexpression inhibits osteoblast differentiation without affecting Runx2 expression. Twist proteins' antiosteogenic function is mediated by a novel domain, the Twist box, which interacts with the Runx2 DNA binding domain to inhibit its function. In vivo mutagenesis confirms the antiosteogenic function of the Twist box. Thus, relief of inhibition by Twist proteins is a mandatory event precluding osteoblast differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Amylin is a member of the calcitonin family of hormones cosecreted with insulin by pancreatic beta cells. Cell culture assays suggest that amylin could affect bone formation and bone resorption, this latter function after its binding to the calcitonin receptor (CALCR). Here we show that Amylin inactivation leads to a low bone mass due to an increase in bone resorption, whereas bone formation is unaffected. In vitro, amylin inhibits fusion of mononucleated osteoclast precursors into multinucleated osteoclasts in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. Although Amylin +/- mice like Amylin-deficient mice display a low bone mass phenotype and increased bone resorption, Calcr +/- mice display a high bone mass due to an increase in bone formation. Moreover, compound heterozygote mice for Calcr and Amylin inactivation displayed bone abnormalities observed in both Calcr +/- and Amylin +/- mice, thereby ruling out that amylin uses CALCR to inhibit osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Thus, amylin is a physiological regulator of bone resorption that acts through an unidentified receptor.",

        "Abstract": "Using chemical lesioning we previously identified hypothalamic neurons that are required for leptin antiosteogenic function. In the course of these studies we observed that destruction of neurons sensitive to monosodium glutamate (MSG) in arcuate nuclei did not affect bone mass. However MSG treatment leads to hypogonadism, a condition inducing bone loss. Therefore the normal bone mass of MSG-treated mice suggested that MSG-sensitive neurons may be implicated in the control of bone mass. To test this hypothesis we assessed bone resorption and bone formation parameters in MSG-treated mice. We show here that MSG-treated mice display the expected increase in bone resorption and that their normal bone mass is due to a concomitant increase in bone formation. Correction of MSG-induced hypogonadism by physiological doses of estradiol corrected the abnormal bone resorptive activity in MSG-treated mice and uncovered their high bone mass phenotype. Because neuropeptide Y (NPY) is highly expressed in MSG-sensitive neurons we tested whether NPY regulates bone formation. Surprisingly, NPY-deficient mice had a normal bone mass. This study reveals that distinct populations of hypothalamic neurons are involved in the control of bone mass and demonstrates that MSG-sensitive neurons control bone formation in a leptin-independent manner. It also indicates that NPY deficiency does not affect bone mass.",

        "Title": "Reversible skeletal abnormalities in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-deficient mice.",
        "Abstract": "Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is a widely distributed ectopeptidase responsible for the degradation of glutathione in the gamma-glutamyl cycle. This cycle is implicated in the metabolism of cysteine, and absence of GGT causes a severe intracellular decrease in this amino acid. GGT-deficient (GGT-/-) mice have multiple metabolic abnormalities and are dwarf. We show here that this latter phenotype is due to a decreased of the growth plate cartilage total height resulting from a proliferative defect of chondrocytes. In addition, analysis of vertebrae and tibiae of GGT-/- mice revealed a severe osteopenia. Histomorphometric studies showed that this low bone mass phenotype results from an increased osteoclast number and activity as well as from a marked decrease in osteoblast activity. Interestingly, neither osteoblasts, osteoclasts, nor chondrocytes express GGT, suggesting that the observed defects are secondary to other abnormalities. N-acetylcysteine supplementation has been shown to reverse the metabolic abnormalities of the GGT-/- mice and in particular to restore the level of IGF-1 and sex steroids in these mice. Consistent with these previous observations, N-acetylcysteine treatment of GGT-/- mice ameliorates their skeletal abnormalities by normalizing chondrocytes proliferation and osteoblastic function. In contrast, resorbtion parameters are only partially normalized in GGT-/- N-acetylcysteine-treated mice, suggesting that GGT regulates osteoclast biology at least partly independently of these hormones. These results establish the importance of cysteine metabolism for the regulation of bone remodeling and longitudinal growth.",

        "Abstract": "Bone mass is maintained constant between puberty and menopause by the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast activity. The existence of a hormonal control of osteoblast activity has been speculated for years by analogy to osteoclast biology. Through the search for such humoral signal(s) regulating bone formation, leptin has been identified as a strong inhibitor of bone formation. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular infusion of leptin has shown that the effect of this adipocyte-derived hormone on bone is mediated via a brain relay. Subsequent studies have led to the identification of hypothalamic groups of neurons involved in leptin's antiosteogenic function. In addition, those neurons or neuronal pathways are distinct from neurons responsible for the regulation of energy metabolism. Finally, the peripheral mediator of leptin's antiosteogenic function has been identified as the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathomimetics administered to mice decreased bone formation and bone mass. Conversely, beta-blockers increased bone formation and bone mass and blunted the bone loss induced by ovariectomy.",

        "Title": "Rescue of the skeletal phenotype in CasR-deficient mice by transfer onto the Gcm2 null background.",
        "Abstract": "To understand the role of the calcium-sensing receptor (CasR) in the skeleton, we used a genetic approach to ablate parathyroid glands and remove the confounding effects of elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) in CasR-deficient mice. CasR deficiency was transferred onto the glial cells missing 2-deficient (Gcm2-deficient) background by intercrossing CasR- and Gcm2-deficient mice. Superimposed Gcm2 deficiency rescued the perinatal lethality in CasR-deficient mice in association with ablation of the parathyroid glands and correction of the severe hyperparathyroidism. In addition, the double homozygous CasR- and Gcm2-deficient mice demonstrated healing of the abnormal mineralization of cartilage and bone associated with CasR deficiency, indicating that rickets and osteomalacia in CasR-deficient mice are not due to an independent function of CasR in bone and cartilage but to the effect of severe hyperparathyroidism in the neonate. Analysis of the skeleton of 6-week-old homozygous CasR- and Gcm2-deficient mice also failed to identify any essential, nonredundant role for CasR in regulating chondrogenesis or osteogenesis, but further studies are needed to establish the function of CasR in the skeleton. In contrast, concomitant Gcm2 and CasR deficiency failed to rescue the hypocalciuria in CasR-deficient mice, consistent with direct regulation of urinary calcium excretion by CasR in the kidney. Double Gcm2- and CasR-deficient mice provide an important model for evaluating the extraparathyroid functions of CasR.",

Here, we show that hypothalamic leptin-dependent antiosteogenic and anorexigenic networks differ, and that the peripheral mediators of leptin antiosteogenic function appear to be neuronal. Neuropeptides mediating leptin anorexigenic function do not affect bone formation. Leptin deficiency results in low sympathetic tone, and genetic or pharmacological ablation of adrenergic signaling leads to a leptin-resistant high bone mass. beta-adrenergic receptors on osteoblasts regulate their proliferation, and a beta-adrenergic agonist decreases bone mass in leptin-deficient and wild-type mice while a beta-adrenergic antagonist increases bone mass in wild-type and ovariectomized mice. None of these manipulations affects body weight. This study demonstrates a leptin-dependent neuronal regulation of bone formation with potential therapeutic implications for osteoporosis.",

        "Abstract": "The skeleton in vertebrates is composed of bone and cartilage, which contains three specific types: osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bone and chondrocytes in cartilage. Like other cell types in the body, skeletal cell differentiation is controlled by multiple transcription factors at various stages of their development. Cbfa1 and Osx, a newly identified zinc-finger containing protein, are osteoblast-specific transcription factors. Loss of function of either one of them leads to absence of bone in mammals. Here, we discuss transcription factors involved in controlling the differentiation of osteoclasts, such as Pu.1 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and chondrocytes, such as Sox proteins. Finally, recent progress in identifying mutations in transcription factors affecting skeletal patterning and development is also described.",

        "Abstract": "Cell- and time-specific gene inactivation should enhance our knowledge of bone biology. Implementation of this technique requires construction of transgenic mouse lines expressing Cre recombinase in osteoblasts, the bone forming cell. We tested several promoter fragments for their ability to drive efficient Cre expression in osteoblasts. In the first mouse transgenic line, the Cre gene was placed under the control of the 2.3-kb proximal fragment of the alpha1(I)-collagen promoter, which is expressed at high levels in osteoblasts throughout their differentiation. Transgenic mice expressing this transgene in bone were bred with the ROSA26 reporter (R26R) strain in which the ROSA26 locus is targeted with a conditional LacZ reporter cassette. In R26R mice, Cre expression and subsequent Cre-mediated recombination lead to expression of the LacZ reporter gene, an event that can be monitored by LacZ staining. LacZ staining was detected in virtually all osteoblasts of alpha1(I)-Cre;R26R mice indicating that homologous recombination occurred in these cells. No other cell type stained blue. In the second line studied, the 1.3-kb fragment of osteocalcin gene 2 (OG2) promoter, which is active in differentiated osteoblasts, was used to drive Cre expression. OG2-Cre mice expressed Cre specifically in bone. However, cross of OG2-Cre mice with R26R mice did not lead to any detectable LacZ staining in osteoblasts. Lastly, we tested a more active artificial promoter derived from the OG2 promoter. The artificial OG2-Cre transgene was expressed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in cartilage and bone samples. After cross of the artificial OG2-Cre mice with R26R mice, we detected a LacZ staining in articular chondrocytes but not in osteoblasts. Our data suggest that the only promoter able to drive Cre expression at a level sufficient to induce recombination in osteoblasts is the alpha1(I)-collagen promoter.",

        "Abstract": "Previously, we determined that the activator protein-1 (AP-1)-binding site and the runt domain (RD)-binding site and their binding proteins, c-Fos.c-Jun and Cbfa, regulate the collagenase-3 promoter in parathyroid hormone-treated and differentiating osteoblasts. Here we show that Cbfa1 and c-Fos.c-Jun appear to cooperatively bind the RD- and AP-1-binding sites and form ternary structures in vitro. Both in vitro and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid studies further demonstrate interaction between Cbfa1 with c-Fos and c-Jun in the absence of phosphorylation and without binding to DNA. Additionally, only the runt domain of Cbfa1 was required for interaction with c-Jun and c-Fos. In mammalian cells, overexpression of Cbfa1 enhanced c-Jun activation of AP-1-binding site promoter activity, demonstrating functional interaction. Finally, insertion of base pairs that disrupted the helical phasing between the AP-1- and RD-binding sites also inhibited collagenase-3 promoter activation. Thus, we provide direct evidence that Cbfa1 and c-Fos.c-Jun physically interact and cooperatively bind the AP-1- and RD-binding sites in the collagenase-3 promoter. Moreover, the AP-1- and RD-binding sites appear to be organized in a specific required helical arrangement that facilitates transcription factor interaction and enables promoter activation.",
