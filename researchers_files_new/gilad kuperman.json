        "Abstract": "While COVID-19 catalyzed a shift to telemedicine, little is known about the persistence of remote cancer care in non-emergent times. We assessed telemedicine use at a high-volume academic cancer center in New York City and analyzed breast and prostate cancer visits pre-COVID-19, peak COVID-19, and post-peak. Descriptive statistics assessed visit mode (in person, telemedicine) and type (new, follow-up, other) by department/specialty, with Fisher's exact tests comparing peak/post-peak differences. The study included 602,233 visits, with telemedicine comprising 2% of visits pre-COVID-19, 50% peak COVID-19, and 30% post-peak. Notable variations emerged by department/specialty and visit type. Post-peak, most departments/specialties continued using telemedicine near or above peak levels, except medicine, neurology, and survivorship, where remote care fell. In psychiatry, social work, and nutrition, nearly all visits were conducted remotely during and after peak COVID-19, while surgery and nursing maintained low telemedicine usage. Post-peak, anesthesiology and neurology used telemedicine seldom for new visits but often for follow-ups, while nursing showed the opposite pattern. These trends suggest department- and visit-specific contexts where providers and patients choose telemedicine in non-emergent conditions. More research is needed to explore these findings and evaluate telemedicine's appropriateness and impact across the care continuum.",

        "Abstract": "Patient-centered care is an essential component of quality health care. To support patient-centered care initiatives at our institution, we created a feature in our EHR to centrally view information about the patient's values, goals and preferences. We applied user-centered design methods to ensure that the aggregate view was easy to use and would meet user needs. We created a six-week plan to iterate through increasingly detailed design mock-ups. We defined 7 user stories that later served as a basis for user testing scripts. We conducted user testing on our third design iteration; we reached theme saturation with 8 testing sessions. We incorporated findings into the fourth design (week 6) but continued to refine the design in parallel to development (through week 20+). The advance directives section required the most attention. We will use a pilot and additional user testing to validate the design and to inform future versions.",

At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), we have integrated and systematized health-related values discussions led by oncology nurses for newly diagnosed cancer patients as part of routine comprehensive cancer care. Such conversations include not only the patient's wishes for care at the end of life but also more holistic personal values, including sources of strength, concerns, hopes, and their definition of an acceptable quality of life. In addition, health care providers use a structured template to document their discussions of patient goals of care.",

        "Abstract": "The United States Preventive Services Taskforce recommends that primary care providers screen patients for an increased risk of carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and refer those who meet family history criteria to genetic counseling. Such screening requires detailed and accurate family history data, which often goes uncollected during a primary care visit due to time constraints, competing priorities, and lack of awareness on behalf of both patients and providers. In order to address these barriers and promote appropriate genetic counseling referral, we developed a user-centered framework that collects and communicates relevant data in order to prepare patients and their primary care providers for an informed discussion on genetic counseling referral. This paper describes this framework and the underlining data schema that makes it possible.",

        "Abstract": "Community health workers, an important and emerging role in the evolution of the care delivery system, are uniquely positioned to play a vital role in information gathering and exchange. NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital carried out a feasibility study to assess community health worker use and impressions of a medication documentation application that runs on a tablet. The nine community health workers successfully collected data on 16 patients in the home setting. On average, 10 medications were collected per patient, and the average time to collect the medication data was 1 hour. Key findings from the focus groups included the need for additional training and the desire to use the device to streamline other documentation activities. In general, the software was judged to be suitable for the proposed task and represents a starting point for further use of tools that leverage the community health worker in a team-based workflow.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical data warehouses, initially directed towards clinical research or financial analyses, are evolving to support quality improvement efforts, and must now address the quality improvement life cycle. In addition, data that are needed for quality improvement often do not reside in a single database, requiring easier methods to query data across multiple disparate sources. We created a virtual data warehouse at NewYork Presbyterian Hospital that allowed us to bring together data from several source systems throughout the organization. We also created a framework to match the maturity of a data request in the quality improvement life cycle to proper tools needed for each request. As projects progress in the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control stages of quality improvement, there is a proper matching of resources the data needs at each step. We describe the analysis and design creating a robust model for applying clinical data warehousing to quality improvement.",

Interview questions focused on social and cultural influences that affected patient engagement activities, government support for current and planned initiatives, data ownership models, and technical issues. Substantive initiatives for providing information to patients in the majority of countries interviewed are present; however, these initiatives were diverse in nature and stage of implementation. Efforts to improve patient access to data are active on a global-scale. There are many open questions about best practices and much can be learned by adopting an international perspective to guide future implementation efforts.",

        "Abstract": "We evaluated the performance of LOINC® and RadLex standard terminologies for covering CT test names from three sites in a health information exchange (HIE) with the eventual goal of building an HIE-based clinical decision support system to alert providers of prior duplicate CTs. Given the goal, the most important parameter to assess was coverage for high frequency exams that were most likely to be repeated. We showed that both LOINC® and RadLex provided sufficient coverage for our use case through calculations of (a) high coverage of 90% and 94%, respectively for the subset of CTs accounting for 99% of exams performed and (b) high concept token coverage (total percentage of exams performed that map to terminologies) of 92% and 95%, respectively. With trends toward greater interoperability, this work may provide a framework for those wishing to map radiology site codes to a standard nomenclature for purposes of tracking resource utilization.",

        "Abstract": "We hypothesized that using communitywide data from a health information exchange (HIE) could improve the ability to identify frequent emergency department (ED) users-those with four or more ED visits in thirty days-by allowing ED use to be measured across unaffiliated hospitals. When we analyzed HIE-wide data instead of site-specific data, we identified 20.3 percent more frequent ED users (5,756 versus 4,785) and 16.0 percent more visits by them to the ED (53,031 versus 45,771). Additionally, we found that 28.8 percent of frequent ED users visited multiple EDs during the twelve-month study period, versus 3.0 percent of all ED users. All three differences were significant ($$p ). An improved ability to identify frequent ED users allows better targeting of case management and other services that can improve frequent ED users' health and reduce their use of costly emergency medical services.",

        "Abstract": "Accountable models of care delivery demand that health care provider organizations be able to exchange clinical data about the patient. The \"Meaningful Use\" program is helping to advance health information exchange by requiring physicians and hospitals to exchange clinical data about patients in order to qualify for incentive payments for electronic health records. Early studies demonstrate that the ability to exchange clinical data among provider organizations has the potential to improve clinical care. However, as with any technology, there is a risk of unintended consequences from health information exchange. This manuscript outlines seven aspects of health information exchange that, if not managed properly, may lead to unintended consequences. These categories are: (1) the desire for complete, accurate and timely data for decision making, (2) data management and presentation, (3) assuring routine use of health information exchange, (4) consideration of patient perceptions and concerns, (5) reputational and financial concerns, (6) technical issues and (7) administrative aspects of health information exchange. Education about the capabilities and limitations of health information exchange, along with checklists to support proper implementation and assure that systems are being used as planned, can mitigate risks and help to realize the promise of this powerful technology.",

        "Abstract": "Notifying ambulatory providers when their patients visit the hospital is a simple concept but potentially a powerful tool for improving care coordination. A health information exchange (HIE) can provide automatic notifications to its members by building services on top of their existing infrastructure. NYCLIX, Inc., a functioning HIE in New York City, has developed a system that detects hospital admissions, discharges and emergency department visits and notifies their providers. The system has been in use since November 2010. Out of 63,305 patients enrolled 6,913 (11%) had one or more events in the study period and on average there were 238 events per day. While event notifications have a clinical value, their use also involves non-clinical care coordination; new workflows should be designed to incorporate a broader care team in their use. This paper describes the user requirements for the notification system, system design, current status, lessons learned and future directions.",

A vision of interoperability and its benefits was articulated more than a decade ago. Since then, important advances toward the goal have been made. The advent of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and the meaningful use program is already having a significant impact on the direction that health-information exchange will take. This paper describes how interoperability activities have unfolded over the last decade and explores how recent initiatives are likely to affect the directions and benefits of health-information exchange.",

However, data are often structured according to a variety of different terminologies and formats, making data interfaces complex and costly. As one strategy to address these challenges, health information organizations (HIOs) have been established to allow secure, integrated sharing of clinical information among numerous stakeholders, including clinical partners and public health, through health information exchange (HIE). We give detailed descriptions of 11 typical cases in which HIOs can be used for public health purposes. We believe that HIOs, and HIE in general, can improve the efficiency and quality of public health reporting, facilitate public health investigation, improve emergency response, and enable public health to communicate information to the clinical community.",

        "Abstract": "Novel H1N1 influenza spread rapidly around the world in spring 2009. Few places were as widely affected as the New York metropolitan area. Emergency departments (EDs) in the region experienced daily visit increases in 2 distinct temporal peaks, with means of 36.8% and 60.7% over baseline in April and May, respectively, and became, in a sense, the \"canary in the coal mine\" for the rest of the country as we braced ourselves for resurgent spread in the fall. Biosurveillance efforts by public health agencies can lead to earlier detection, potentially forestalling spread of outbreaks and leading to better situational awareness by frontline medical staff and public health workers as they respond to a crisis, but biosurveillance has traditionally relied on manual reporting by hospital administrators when they are least able: in the midst of a public health crisis. This article explores the use of health information exchange networks, which enable the secure flow of clinical data among otherwise unaffiliated providers across entire regions for the purposes of clinical care, as a tool for automated biosurveillance reporting. Additionally, this article uses a health information exchange to assess H1N1's effect on ED visit rates and discusses preparedness recommendations and lessons learned from the spring 2009 H1N1 experience across 11 geographically distinct EDs in New York City that participate in the health information exchange.",

The project's Core Services Content Work Group (CSCWG) developed the content specifications for the project. The CSCWG developed content specifications for a summary patient record and for eight use cases that were implemented in demonstration events in 2008. The CSCWG developed tools to represent the specifications and facilitate implementation. The experience revealed that, in general, the Health Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP) constructs served as a suitable starting point for the development of content specifications for interoperability. The ability to adhere to specified terminologies still presents significant challenges. This paper describes the process of developing the content specifications and lessons learned.",

        "Abstract": "In 2007, the Leapfrog CPOE standard required that all clinical alert overrides be accompanied by an override reason. We wanted to know how many of the free text comments left by clinicians were actually override reasons, and how many were other types of communication. We reviewed 3583 free text comments left voluntarily by clinicians while responding to an alert in a CPOE system. Of the comments received, 58% were override reasons, 28% were acknowledgment of the alert, 9% were content free and over 5% were misdirected communication, written with intent to reach someone who does not receive the alert comments. This is particularly concerning because much of the misdirected communication contained clinical instructions. Those clinical instructions were stored with the alert rather than with any clinical orders, and thus were not viewed by anyone receiving the orders. Our results show that free text alert comments may cause communication failures.",

        "Abstract": "Parallel to the monumental problem of replacing paper-and-pen-based patient information management systems with electronic ones is the problem of evaluating the extent to which the change represents an improvement. All clinicians must grapple with this daunting challenge; those with little or no informatics expertise may be particularly surprised by the attendant difficulties. To do so successfully, they must be able to explicitly conceptualize the daily clinical work-a prerequisite for appreciating and reasonably evaluating it. Further, few of these evaluators may have reflected on the dynamic interaction between their work and their tools-how changing a tool necessarily changes the work. This article illuminates these problems by telling the story of how one patient care information systems committee first learned to think about the purpose of a patient information management system, and second, how to evaluate the impact of its implementation.",

We have implemented a strategic planning process to determine the information technology initiatives that will best help us improve quality. The process began with the creation of a Clinical Quality and IT Committee. The Committee identified 2 high priority goals that would enable demonstrably high quality care: 1) excellence at data warehousing, and 2) optimal use of automated clinical documentation to capture encounter-related quality and safety data. For each high priority goal, a working group was created to develop specific recommendations. The Data Warehousing subgroup has recommended the implementation of an architecture management process and an improved ability for users to get access to aggregate data. The Structured Documentation subgroup is establishing recommendations for a documentation template creation process. The strategic planning process at times is slow, but assures that the organization is focusing on the information technology activities most likely to lead to improved quality.",

        "Title": "Medication-related clinical decision support in computerized provider order entry systems: a review.",
        "Abstract": "While medications can improve patients' health, the process of prescribing them is complex and error prone, and medication errors cause many preventable injuries. Computer provider order entry (CPOE) with clinical decision support (CDS), can improve patient safety and lower medication-related costs. To realize the medication-related benefits of CDS within CPOE, one must overcome significant challenges. Healthcare organizations implementing CPOE must understand what classes of CDS their CPOE systems can support, assure that clinical knowledge underlying their CDS systems is reasonable, and appropriately represent electronic patient data. These issues often influence to what extent an institution will succeed with its CPOE implementation and achieve its desired goals. Medication-related decision support is probably best introduced into healthcare organizations in two stages, basic and advanced. Basic decision support includes drug-allergy checking, basic dosing guidance, formulary decision support, duplicate therapy checking, and drug-drug interaction checking. Advanced decision support includes dosing support for renal insufficiency and geriatric patients, guidance for medication-related laboratory testing, drug-pregnancy checking, and drug-disease contraindication checking. In this paper, the authors outline some of the challenges associated with both basic and advanced decision support and discuss how those challenges might be addressed. The authors conclude with summary recommendations for delivering effective medication-related clinical decision support addressed to healthcare organizations, application and knowledge base vendors, policy makers, and researchers.",

        "Abstract": "Regional health information organizations and electronic health information exchange may have an important impact on the practice of emergency medicine in the United States. Regional health information organizations are local or regional information-sharing networks that enable electronic data interchange among stakeholders in a given geographic area. These stakeholders may include hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, clinics, private physicians' offices, pharmacies, laboratories, radiology facilities, health departments, payers, and possibly the patients themselves. Regional health information organizations are being formed across the country to improve the safety and efficiency of clinical care; improve public health efforts, biosurveillance, and disaster management response; and potentially create large databases of deidentified aggregate data for research. Because of the unique need for rapid access to information and the acuity of the clinical environment, few areas of the health care delivery system stand to change and benefit more from health information exchange than our nation's emergency departments. This article will explain the motivation for the development of regional health information organizations, identify some of the important issues in their formation, and discuss how their development might affect the practice of emergency medicine.",

At NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, we have implemented a formal alert management process whereby only hospital committees and departments can request alerts. An explicit requestor, who will help resolve the details of the alert logic and the alert message must be identified. Alerts must be requested in writing using a structured alert request form. Alert requests are reviewed by the Alert Committee and then forwarded to the Information Systems department for a software development estimate. The model required that clinical committees and departments become more actively involved in the development of alerts than had previously been necessary. In the 12 months following implementation, 10 alert requests were received. The model has been well received. A lot of the knowledge engineering work has been distributed and burden has been removed from scarce medical informatics resources.",

        "Abstract": "This case study of a serious medication error demonstrates the necessity of a comprehensive methodology for the analysis of failures in interaction between humans and information systems. The authors used a novel approach to analyze a dosing error related to computer-based ordering of potassium chloride (KCl). The method included a chronological reconstruction of events and their interdependencies from provider order entry usage logs, semistructured interviews with involved clinicians, and interface usability inspection of the ordering system. Information collected from all sources was compared and evaluated to understand how the error evolved and propagated through the system. In this case, the error was the product of faults in interaction among human and system agents that methods limited in scope to their distinct analytical domains would not identify. The authors characterized errors in several converging aspects of the drug ordering process: confusing on-screen laboratory results review, system usability difficulties, user training problems, and suboptimal clinical system safeguards that all contributed to a serious dosing error. The results of the authors' analysis were used to formulate specific recommendations for interface layout and functionality modifications, suggest new user alerts, propose changes to user training, and address error-prone steps of the KCl ordering process to reduce the risk of future medication dosing errors.",

        "Abstract": "The health care environment is communications and information intensive. Nurses especially have communications as part of their routine activities, yet little is known about specific nursing communications needs and technologies that might address these needs. This project analyzed the specific communications needs of nurses at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, MA, through focus group meetings, nursing staff interviews, and direct observation of unit communications. Based on these data, an ideal requirements list for a nursing communication system was created. Data were also gathered and analyzed from units piloting cell phones as nursing communications tools. On non-cell phone units we found that the bulk of communication activity is from the front desk operations associate to the nurse through a sub-optimal overhead paging system that is often unclear or inaudible. The pilot of cellular phones has demonstrated improvements in nursing communications at MGH and there are indications that other emerging technologies will be better able to address the ideal communication needs of nurses.",

Such knowledge is currently incorporated in a variety of clinical applications, yet the methods of representation and of execution vary and the ability to author/edit the rules by human experts is limited. We expanded on a 2002 \"Knowledge Inventory\" at Partners to evaluate feasibility of designing a single representation approach entailing: (a) exploration of specific needs of different applications, in terms of kinds of response required (synchronous/asynchronous, time criticality, etc.), context (e.g., implied patient, time frame, or episode), and kinds of actions to be triggered; (b) kind of representation of knowledge and feasibility of casting knowledge in the form of if em leader then statements; and (c) data and knowledge resources used (implied data model, and particular knowledge sources and terminology sources). The result of analysis was to design an architecture to accomplish this goal. We also did preliminary analysis of requirements for authoring for such a representation, and for implementation.",

This study found that better information might have prevented half of serious medication errors, and that lack of drug-specific knowledge accounted for the single largest proportion of these events (29%).2 While this information was available somewhere (either on paper or electronically), it was not at the providers' fingertips. Information technology should anticipate clinicians' needs, and bring the information they require to the point of care. For this purpose, we developed an application extender called KnowledgeLink, which provides \"just-in-time\" context-sensitive information retrieval for drug-related queries.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical decision support such as alerts, reminders and guidance are driven by rules often distributed among a variety of applications in a healthcare information system. Due to the increasing size of rule bases, there is a growing need to manage this dispersed knowledge in an integrated environment. A system for management of executable clinical knowledge such as rules should (1) assist in the development and maintenance of rules throughout the rules' life-cycles, (2) support search and retrieval of rules in the knowledge base (e.g., rules for diabetes, rules created by a particular individual), and (3) facilitate the analyses of rules in the knowledge base (e.g., identify rules not updated in the last year). In order to create such a clinical knowledge management system it is necessary to model the meta-data of rules. There have been efforts to document meta-data about rules within the Arden Syntax Medical Logical Modules' project. However, the maintenance and library categories in that project allow mainly free-text information about a rule. We have created a comprehensive meta-data structure and taxonomy for describing clinical rules that supports the features of a knowledge management system. We also tested this model using a representative set of rules.",

        "Abstract": "A significant fraction of medication errors and preventable adverse drug events are related to drug-allergy interactions (DAIs). Computerized prescribing can help prevent DAIs, but an accurate record of the patient's allergies is required. At Partners HealthCare System in Boston, the patient's allergy list is distributed across several applications including computer physician order entry (CPOE), the outpatient medical record, pharmacy applications, and nurse charting applications. Currently, each application has access only to its own allergy data. This paper presents details of a project designed to integrate the various allergy repositories at Partners. We present data documenting that patients have allergy data stored in multiple repositories. We give detail about issues we are encountering such as which applications should participate in the repository, whether \"NKA\" or \"NKDA\" should be used to document known absence of allergies, and which personnel should be allowed to enter allergies. The issues described in this paper may well be faced by other initiatives intended to create comprehensive allergy repositories.",

To address this patient safety and quality of care issue, Partners Healthcare has developed a browser-based, provider-centric, comprehensive results management application to help clinic physicians review and act upon test results in a safe, reliable, and efficient manner. The application, called the Results Manager, incorporates extensive decision support features to classify the degree of abnormality for each result, presents guidelines to help clinicians manage abnormal results, allows clinicians to generate result letters to patients with predefined, context-sensitive templates and prompts physicians to set reminders for future testing. In this paper, we outline the design process and functionality of Results Manager. We also discuss its underlying architectural design, which revolves around a clinical event monitor and a rules engine, and the methodological challenges encountered in designing this application.",

        "Abstract": "Adverse drug events cause a large number of injuries, and adverse events caused by medications administered in the face of known allergies represent an important preventable cause of patient harm. Computerized systems can effectively prevent reactions due to known allergies, but building an effective allergy prevention feature is challenging and presents many interesting informatics issues that have both methodological and operational implications. In this paper, we present the experiences from one large delivery system in delivering allergy-related decision support, discuss some of the different approaches that we have used, and then propose a future approach. We also discuss the methodological, behavioral, and operational issues that have arisen which have a major impact on success. Key factors in drug-allergy checking include storing patient allergy data in a single common repository, representing allergy data using suitable terminologies and creating groups of allergies for inferencing purposes, being judicious about which allergy warnings to display, conveying the reaction that the patient has experienced when exposed to the drug to inform the provider of the importance of the warning, and perhaps most important, implementing strategies to optimize the likelihood that allergy information will be entered.",

        "Abstract": "While evidence-based medicine has increasingly broad-based support in health care, it remains difficult to get physicians to actually practice it. Across most domains in medicine, practice has lagged behind knowledge by at least several years. The authors believe that the key tools for closing this gap will be information systems that provide decision support to users at the time they make decisions, which should result in improved quality of care. Furthermore, providers make many errors, and clinical decision support can be useful for finding and preventing such errors. Over the last eight years the authors have implemented and studied the impact of decision support across a broad array of domains and have found a number of common elements important to success. The goal of this report is to discuss these lessons learned in the interest of informing the efforts of others working to make the practice of evidence-based medicine a reality.",

        "Abstract": "Several analyses have detected substantial quality problems throughout the health care system. Information technology has consistently been identified as an important component of any approach for improvement. Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) is a promising technology that allows physicians to enter orders into a computer instead of handwriting them. Because CPOE fundamentally changes the ordering process, it can substantially decrease the overuse, underuse, and misuse of health care services. Studies have documented that CPOE can decrease costs, shorten length of stay, decrease medical errors, and improve compliance with several types of guidelines. The costs of CPOE are substantial both in terms of technology and organizational process analysis and redesign, system implementation, and user training and support. Computerized physician order entry is a relatively new technology, and there is no consensus on the best approaches to many of the challenges it presents. This technology can yield many significant benefits and is an important platform for future changes to the health care system. Organizational leaders must advocate for CPOE as a critical tool in improving health care quality.",

We have implemented a system for creating, maintaining, and navigating computer-based clinical algorithms integrated with our electronic medical record. This article describes our progress and reports on lessons learned that might guide future work in this field. We discuss issues and obstacles related to choosing and adapting a guideline for electronic implementation, representing and executing the guideline as a computerized algorithm, and integrating it into the clinical workflow of outpatient care. Although obstacles were encountered at each of these steps, the most difficult were related to workflow integration.",

        "Abstract": "Current paper-based processes for performing billing documentation and test ordering at the end of a clinic visit are fraught with problems, resulting in numerous workflow inefficiencies and significant revenue losses for a healthcare organization. Paper forms are often filled out inaccurately or incompletely, or can be misrouted or lost. Computerizing these processes can alleviate many of these problems. We are building a new module for our ambulatory electronic medical record system to automate these \"end of visit\" (EOV) activities, which includes completing encounter forms, ordering lab and diagnostic tests, and printing patient visit summaries. An EOV module must be carefully designed to incorporate the needs of clinicians, front office staff, ancillary labs, medical records, and finance departments. An optimally designed EOV system should be customizable to fit into the clinician's workflow, and should help reduce financial losses, improve clinical documentation, and reduce workflow inefficiencies.",

Clinicians who are expecting a particular laboratory result for a particular patient can request a report of the result via an alphanumeric pager as soon as the result is filed into the patient database. This feature has gained popularity and is heavily used in both inpatient and outpatient settings, at a rate of about 2,300 times per month. This event-monitor-based feature illustrates one way that information technology can be applied to improve communication in health care.",
