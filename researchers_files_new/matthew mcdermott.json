        "Abstract": "Recent computational studies have predicted many new ternary nitrides, revealing synthetic opportunities in this underexplored phase space. However, synthesizing new ternary nitrides is difficult, in part because intermediate and product phases often have high cohesive energies that inhibit diffusion. Here, we report the synthesis of two new phases, calcium zirconium nitride (CaZrN",

Currently, there is limited theoretical guidance for identifying optimal solid-state synthesis procedures. We introduce two selectivity metrics, primary and secondary competition, to assess the favorability of target/impurity phase formation in solid-state reactions. We used these metrics to analyze 3520 solid-state reactions in the literature, ranking existing approaches to popular target materials. Additionally, we implemented these metrics in a data-driven synthesis planning workflow and demonstrated its application in the synthesis of barium titanate (BaTiO",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is characterized by extensive resistance to conventional therapies, making clinical management a challenge. Here we map the epigenetic dependencies of cancer stem cells, cells that preferentially evade therapy and drive progression, and identify SWI/SNF complex member SMARCD3 as a regulator of pancreatic cancer cells. Although SWI/SNF subunits often act as tumor suppressors, we show that SMARCD3 is amplified in cancer, enriched in pancreatic cancer stem cells and upregulated in the human disease. Diverse genetic mouse models of pancreatic cancer and stage-specific Smarcd3 deletion reveal that Smarcd3 loss preferentially impacts established tumors, improving survival especially in context of chemotherapy. Mechanistically, SMARCD3 acts with FOXA1 to control lipid and fatty acid metabolism, programs associated with therapy resistance and poor prognosis in cancer. These data identify SMARCD3 as an epigenetic modulator responsible for establishing the metabolic landscape in aggressive pancreatic cancer cells and a potential target for new therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical imaging applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations such as female patients, Black patients, or patients of low socioeconomic status. Such biases are especially troubling in the context of underdiagnosis, whereby the AI algorithm would inaccurately label an individual with a disease as healthy, potentially delaying access to care. Here, we examine algorithmic underdiagnosis in chest X-ray pathology classification across three large chest X-ray datasets, as well as one multi-source dataset. We find that classifiers produced using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques consistently and selectively underdiagnosed under-served patient populations and that the underdiagnosis rate was higher for intersectional under-served subpopulations, for example, Hispanic female patients. Deployment of AI systems using medical imaging for disease diagnosis with such biases risks exacerbation of existing care biases and can potentially lead to unequal access to medical treatment, thereby raising ethical concerns for the use of these models in the clinic.",

Such corrections are commonly used to improve the accuracy of computational enthalpies of formation, phase stability predictions, and other energy-derived properties, for example. We incorporate this method into a new DFT energy correction scheme comprising a mixture of oxidation-state and composition-dependent corrections and show that many chemical systems contain unstable polymorphs that may actually be predicted stable when uncertainty is taken into account. We then illustrate how these uncertainties can be used to estimate the probability that a compound is stable on a compositional phase diagram, thus enabling better-informed assessments of compound stability.",

        "Abstract": "Accelerated inorganic synthesis remains a significant challenge in the search for novel, functional materials. Many of the principles which enable \"synthesis by design\" in synthetic organic chemistry do not exist in solid-state chemistry, despite the availability of extensive computed/experimental thermochemistry data. In this work, we present a chemical reaction network model for solid-state synthesis constructed from available thermochemistry data and devise a computationally tractable approach for suggesting likely reaction pathways via the application of pathfinding algorithms and linear combination of lowest-cost paths in the network. We demonstrate initial success of the network in predicting complex reaction pathways comparable to those reported in the literature for YMnO",

        "Abstract": "Modeling the relationship between chemical structure and molecular activity is a key goal in drug development. Many benchmark tasks have been proposed for molecular property prediction, but these tasks are generally aimed at specific, isolated biomedical properties. In this work, we propose a new cross-modal small molecule retrieval task, designed to force a model to learn to associate the structure of a small molecule with the transcriptional change it induces. We develop this task formally as multi-view alignment problem, and present a coordinated deep learning approach that jointly optimizes representations of both chemical structure and perturbational gene expression profiles. We benchmark our results against oracle models and principled baselines, and find that cell line variability markedly influences performance in this domain. Our work establishes the feasibility of this new task, elucidates the limitations of current data and systems, and may serve to catalyze future research in small molecule representation learning.",

        "Abstract": "Machine learning systems have received much attention recently for their ability to achieve expert-level performance on clinical tasks, particularly in medical imaging. Here, we examine the extent to which state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers trained to yield diagnostic labels from X-ray images are biased with respect to protected attributes. We train convolution neural networks to predict 14 diagnostic labels in 3 prominent public chest X-ray datasets: MIMIC-CXR, Chest-Xray8, CheXpert, as well as a multi-site aggregation of all those datasets. We evaluate the TPR disparity - the difference in true positive rates (TPR) - among different protected attributes such as patient sex, age, race, and insurance type as a proxy for socioeconomic status. We demonstrate that TPR disparities exist in the state-of-the-art classifiers in all datasets, for all clinical tasks, and all subgroups. A multi-source dataset corresponds to the smallest disparities, suggesting one way to reduce bias. We find that TPR disparities are not significantly correlated with a subgroup's proportional disease burden. As clinical models move from papers to products, we encourage clinical decision makers to carefully audit for algorithmic disparities prior to deployment.

We believe that realizing this potential requires specialized, high-capacity machine learning methods capable of using underlying biological structure, but the development of such models is hampered by the lack of published benchmark tasks and well characterized baselines. In this work, we establish such benchmarks and baselines by profiling many classifiers against biologically motivated tasks on two curated views of a large, public gene expression dataset (the LINCS corpus) and one privately produced dataset. We provide these two curated views of the public LINCS dataset and our benchmark tasks to enable direct comparisons to future methodological work and help spur deep learning method development on this modality. In addition to profiling a battery of traditional classifiers, including linear models, random forests, decision trees, K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers, and feed-forward artificial neural networks (FF-ANNs), we also test a method novel to this data modality: graph convolugtional neural networks (GCNNs), which allow us to incorporate prior biological domain knowledge. We find that GCNNs can be highly performant, with large datasets, whereas FF-ANNs consistently perform well. Non-neural classifiers are dominated by linear models and KNN classifiers.",

        "Abstract": "Positioning of microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) incorporates biochemical and mechanical cues for proper alignment of the mitotic spindle and cell division site. Current experimental and theoretical studies in the early Caenorhabditis elegans embryo assume remarkable changes in the origin and polarity of forces acting on the MTOCs. These changes must occur over a few minutes, between initial centration and rotation of the pronuclear complex and entry into mitosis, and the models do not replicate in vivo timing of centration and rotation. Here we propose a model that incorporates asymmetry in the microtubule arrays generated by each MTOC, which we demonstrate with in vivo measurements, and a similar asymmetric force profile to that required for posterior-directed spindle displacement during mitosis. We find that these asymmetries are capable of and important for recapitulating the simultaneous centration and rotation of the pronuclear complex observed in vivo. The combination of theoretical and experimental evidence provided here offers a unified framework for the spatial organization and forces needed for pronuclear centration, rotation, and spindle displacement in the early C. elegans embryo.",

        "Title": "The hydrogel template method for fabrication of homogeneous nano/microparticles.",
        "Abstract": "Nano/microparticles have been used widely in drug delivery applications. The majority of the particles are prepared by the conventional emulsion methods, which tend to result in particles with heterogeneous size distribution with sub-optimal drug loading and release properties. Recently, microfabrication methods have been used to make nano/microparticles with a monodisperse size distribution. The existing methods utilize solid templates for making particles, and the collection of individual particles after preparation has not been easy. The new hydrogel template approach was developed to make the particle preparation process simple and fast. The hydrogel template approach is based on the unique properties of physical gels that can undergo sol-gel phase transition upon changes in environmental conditions. The phase reversible hydrogels, however, are in general mechanically too weak to be treated as a solid material. It was unexpectedly found that gelatin hydrogels could be made to possess various properties necessary for microfabrication of nano/microparticles in large quantities. The size of the particles can be adjusted from 200 nm to >50 microm, providing flexibility in controlling the size in drug delivery formulations. The simplicity in processing makes the hydrogel template method useful for scale-up manufacturing of particles. The drug loading capacity is 50% or higher, and yet the initial burst release is minimal. The hydrogel template approach presents a new strategy of preparing nano/microparticles of predefined size and shape with homogeneous size distribution for drug delivery applications.",

        "Abstract": "Although oriented carbon nanotubes, oriented nanowires of metals, semiconductors and oxides have attracted wide attention, there have been few reports on oriented polymer nanostructures such as nanowires. In this paper we report the assembly of large arrays of oriented nanowires containing molecularly aligned conducting polymers (polyaniline) without using a porous membrane template to support the polymer. The uniform oriented nanowires were prepared through controlled nucleation and growth during a stepwise electrochemical deposition process in which a large number of nuclei were first deposited on the substrate using a large current density. After the initial nucleation, the current density was reduced stepwise in order to grow the oriented nanowires from the nucleation sites created in the first step. The usefulness of these new polymer structures is demonstrated with a chemical sensor device for H(2)O(2), the detection of which is widely investigated for biosensors. Finally, we demonstrated that controlled nucleation and growth is a general approach and has potential for growing oriented nanostructures of other materials.",

Here we report the first synthesis of unusual oriented and extended helical nanostructures in synthetic ceramics. Large arrays of oriented helical ZnO nanorods and columns are formed using simple citrate ions to control the growth habits of the ZnO crystal. This novel mechanism could lead to new approaches to control the orientation, the surface area, and the defect structure of synthetic materials that are critical for practical applications. The morphology generated in the helical ZnO nanostructure shows remarkable resemblance to the growth morphology of nacreous calcium carbonate and thus may shed new light on morphology and orientation control of biominerals.",
