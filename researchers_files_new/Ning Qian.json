        "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the T cell immunoreceptor with ITIM and Ig domains (TIGIT) expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). TIGIT expression was measured by western blot, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Seventy-two paired surgical specimens were collected from patients with stage I-IV LUAD. The expression of TIGIT in surgical specimens was determined using immunohistochemistry. TIGIT was overexpressed in LUAD tissues. Moreover, overexpressed TIGIT was significantly associated with advanced clinical staging, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and TP53 mutations in LUAD. Moreover, high expression of TIGIT was negatively correlated with purity of CD4+ T cells. High rations of TIGIT+CD4+ T cells predicted poor overall survival of LUAD patients. Additionally, high ratios of TIGIT+CD4+ T cells is closely related to CD4+ T cell depletion. Taken together, TIGIT was overexpressed in LUAD patients. High levels of TIGIT induced the alteration of CD4+ T cell based immunomodulation and predicted poor prognosis of LUAD patients. Therefore, TIGIT can be potential biomarker for LUAD.",

        "Abstract": "Sensory processing is often studied by examining how a given neuron responds to a parameterized set of stimuli (tuning curve) or how a given stimulus evokes responses from a parameterized set of neurons (population response). Although tuning curves and the corresponding population responses contain the same information, they can have different properties. These differences are known to be important because the perception of a stimulus should be decoded from its population response, not from any single tuning curve. The differences are less studied in the spatial domain where a cell's spatial tuning curve is simply its receptive field (RF) profile. Here, we focus on evaluating the common belief that perrisaccadic forward and convergent RF shifts lead to forward (translational) and convergent (compressive) perceptual mislocalization, respectively, and investigate the effects of three related factors: decoders' awareness of RF shifts, changes of cells' covering density near attentional locus (the saccade target), and attentional response modulation. We find that RF shifts ",

        "Abstract": "Palm grass (Setaria palmifolia) has been used as an ornamental plant and vegetable crop (Wu, 2009; Plarre, 1995). In June 2019, 2-10 mm severe leaf lesions with gray centers and brown-yellow edges were observed on the leaves of palm grass in Liuyang city (28°43'N, 114°12'E), Hunan province, China (Fig. 1A). Disease incidence on leaves was 20 - 40%. The infected leaves were collected and disinfected with 75% alcohol for 30 sec and 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, followed by three rinses in sterilized ddH2O, dried on sterilized filter paper, and incubated on water agar for 48 h under continuous fluorescent light at 26℃. Then, typical pyriform and 2-septate conidia (23.97 - 30.37 × 7.42 - 9.98 μm, N = 30) appeared at the lesions (Fig. 1B). Four single-spore were captured, and then grew on oatmeal tomato agar for seven days under continuous fluorescent light at 26℃ to obtain four isolates (LY-ZY-7a, -7b, -9b and -9c) and produce conidia for inoculation tests. The colony morphology of LY-ZY-7b on OTA was gray and floccose, and the growth rate was 6.15 - 6.31 mm/d at 26 °C (Fig. 1C). Spores of LY-ZY-7b were washed off with sterilized ddH2O plus 0.025% Tween-20 to make spore suspensions. For scratch inoculation, 10 μL spore suspension (1 × 105 spores/mL) was inoculated on the wound scratched with a sterilized pin along the vein (3 mm × 3 mm) on palm grass middle leaf of 4-week-old seedlings. The inoculated leaves were sealed in a 15-cm Petri dish. For spray inoculation, 20 mL spore suspension (5 × 104 spores/mL) was made and sprayed on ten healthy palm grasses of 4-week-old seedlings. Plants used as negative controls were sprayed with sterilized ddH2O plus 0.025% Tween-20 (Liu et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2014). After inoculation, all plants were put into transparent boxes to maintain > 95% humidity and covered with black plastic bags for one day. Then, the boxes containing the plants were placed in a growth chamber at 26°C (12 h light / 12 h darkness photoperiod). After six days, typical blast-type lesions with brown-yellow edges were visible on the leaves. Control plants did not show symptoms (Fig. 1D, 1E). Microscopical examination showed that the conidia and conidiophore recovered from the lesion of the inoculated plants have the same morphology as those recovered from natural infected tissues (Fig. 1F, 1G). The colony morphology of the pathogen isolated from the artificially inoculated tissue was consistent with that of isolate LY-ZY-7b (Fig. 1C). The spore suspension (5 × 104 spores/mL) of isolate LY-ZY-7b and one rice-infecting strain P131 (Yang et al., 2010) was made and sprayed onto 4-week-old seedlings of three rice cultivars. But unfortunately, isolate LY-ZY-7b could not cause any disease lesions on the tested rice cultivars, whereas strain P131 produced many typical blast lesions on rice leaves (Fig. 1H). Then, the fungal genetic identity of four isolates (LY-ZY-7a, -7b, -9b, and -9c) was confirmed by comparison of the sequence obtained from partial DNA of Actin (ACT), ITS, and RPB1 loci from our isolates and those previously published by Klaubauf et al. 2014. The nucleotide sequences of ACT, ITS, and RPB1 were submitted to GenBank ON228695-ON228697 (ACT), ON210978-ON210980 (ITS), ON228698-ON228701 (RPB1). A phylogenetic tree deduced from a maximum likelihood analysis based on combined ACT-ITS-RPB1 sequence data of Pyricularia showed that these four isolates (LY-ZY-7a, -7b, -9b, and -9c) clustered together on Pyricularia oryzae, with a high bootstrap support value (Fig. 2). Based on morphological characteristics and molecular phylogeny, these four isolates were identified as P. oryzae (Klaubauf et al. 2014; Qi et al. 2019). To our knowledge, this is the first report of blast disease on palm grass caused by P. oryzae in China, which will help develop disease management strategies against palm grass blast. Moreover, as a host of P. oryzae, palm grass might contribute as an inoculum source for blast diseases on cereal crops (such as rice, wheat, and barley) caused by P. oryzae in the field.",

        "Abstract": "Sensory encoding (how stimuli evoke sensory responses) is known to progress from low- to high-level features. Decoding (how responses lead to perception) is less understood but is often assumed to follow the same hierarchy. Accordingly, orientation decoding must occur in low-level areas such as V1, without cross-fixation interactions. However, a study, Ding, Cueva, Tsodyks, and Qian (2017), provided evidence against the assumption and proposed that visual decoding may often follow a high-to-low-level hierarchy in working memory, where higher-to-lower-level constraints introduce interactions among lower-level features. If two orientations on opposite sides of the fixation are both task relevant and enter working memory, then they should interact with each other. We indeed found the predicted cross-fixation interactions (repulsion and correlation) between orientations. Control experiments and analyses ruled out alternative explanations such as reporting bias and adaptation across trials on the same side of the fixation. Moreover, we explained the data using a retrospective high-to-low-level Bayesian decoding framework.",

        "Title": "Oxidative stress caused by a dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway is involved in abnormal placenta formation in pregnant mice with chronic fatigue syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized by extreme fatigue and disabling symptoms. Women with CFS often have a high risk of gynaecological problems such as irregular menstruation, endometriosis and pelvic pain and sexual dysfunction. Our previous results have shown that, in pregnant mice, CFS significantly decreased the progestational hormone level in serum, as well as learning and memory, and the function of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. In addition, the F1 generation also suffered from congenital hypothyroidism. At present, there has been no report about placenta formation and embryonic development in pregnant mice with CFS. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of CFS on the morphology, oxidative stress and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway during placenta formation. In this study, we found that CFS decreased the number of implantation sites for blastocysts, and increased the number of absorbed, stillborn and malformed fetuses. The morphology and structure of the placenta were abnormal in pregnant mice with CFS. Further study found that the oxidative stress in serum, uterus and placenta was increased in pregnant mice with CFS, while the levels of antioxidase were decreased. CFS also inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in the placenta. These results suggested that inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway and enhanced oxidative stress play an important role in abnormal placentation in pregnant mice with CFS.",

        "Abstract": "Deficits in glutamatergic function are well established in schizophrenia (SZ) as reflected in \"input\" dysfunction across sensory systems. By contrast, less is known about contributions of the GABAergic system to impairments in excitatory/inhibitory balance. We investigated this issue by measuring contrast thresholds for orientation detection, orientation discriminability, and orientation-tilt-aftereffect curves in schizophrenia subjects and matched controls. These measures depend on the amplitude and width of underlying orientation tuning curves, which, in turn, depend on excitatory and inhibitory interactions. By simulating a well-established V1 orientation selectivity model and its link to perception, we demonstrate that reduced cortical excitation and inhibition are both necessary to explain our psychophysical data. Reductions in GABAergic feedback may represent a compensatory response to impaired glutamatergic input in SZ, or a separate pathophysiological event. We also found evidence for the widely accepted, but rarely tested, inverse relationship between orientation discriminability and tuning width.",

        "Abstract": "Gut microbiome lives in the intestinal tract of animals and plays an important role in almost all life processes. Gut microbiome balance is beneficial to health, and imbalance leads to many diseases, one of which is obesity epidemic. However, gut microbiome is also influenced by host hormone, and different gut microbiome composition is observed between the sexes. Here, we studied whether castrated male Guizhou minipigs with obesity own the same gut microbiome composition and microbial function predictions with those in obese females. We sequenced the hypervariable regions V3 to V4 of bacterial 16s rRNA of fecal samples collected from our study subjects. We observed that the operational taxonomic units were small, which suggested that the abundance of gut microbiome may be influenced by low genetic diversity of host. Our results also suggested that the castrated male has different gut microbial composition compared to the obese female. An increasing Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was observed in both castrated male and obese female groups, which suggested that the main adipogenic gut microorganism in obese Guizhou minipigs in our studies is the same with that in other obese mammals. However, we also observed that there were function prediction differences of obese Guizhou minipigs between female and castrated male, which suggested that the influence of gut microbiome on obesity between them is different.",

        "Title": "A Single, Continuously Applied Control Policy for Modeling Reaching Movements with and without Perturbation.",
        "Abstract": "It has been debated whether kinematic features, such as the number of peaks or decomposed submovements in a velocity profile, indicate the number of discrete motor impulses or result from a continuous control process. The debate is particularly relevant for tasks involving target perturbation, which can alter movement kinematics. To simulate such tasks, finite-horizon models require two preset movement durations to compute two control policies before and after the perturbation. Another model employs infinite- and finite-horizon formulations to determine, respectively, movement durations and control policies, which are updated every time step. We adopted an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model that, unlike previous approaches, does not preset movement durations or use multiple control policies. It contains both control-dependent and independent noises in system dynamics, state-dependent and independent noises in sensory feedbacks, and different delays and noise levels for visual and proprioceptive feedbacks. We analytically derived an optimal solution that can be applied continuously to move an effector toward a target regardless of whether, when, or where the target jumps. This single policy produces different numbers of peaks and \"submovements\" in velocity profiles for different conditions and trials. Movements that are slower or perturbed later appear to have more submovements. The model is also consistent with the observation that subjects can perform the perturbation task even without detecting the target jump or seeing their hands during reaching. Finally, because the model incorporates Weber's law via a state representation relative to the target, it explains why initial and terminal visual feedback are, respectively, less and more effective in improving end-point accuracy. Our work suggests that the number of peaks or submovements in a velocity profile does not necessarily reflect the number of motor impulses and that the difference between initial and terminal feedback does not necessarily imply a transition between open- and closed-loop strategies.",

        "Title": "Visual perception as retrospective Bayesian decoding from high- to low-level features.",
        "Abstract": "When a stimulus is presented, its encoding is known to progress from low- to high-level features. How these features are decoded to produce perception is less clear, and most models assume that decoding follows the same low- to high-level hierarchy of encoding. There are also theories arguing for global precedence, reversed hierarchy, or bidirectional processing, but they are descriptive without quantitative comparison with human perception. Moreover, observers often inspect different parts of a scene sequentially to form overall perception, suggesting that perceptual decoding requires working memory, yet few models consider how working-memory properties may affect decoding hierarchy. We probed decoding hierarchy by comparing absolute judgments of single orientations and relative/ordinal judgments between two sequentially presented orientations. We found that lower-level, absolute judgments failed to account for higher-level, relative/ordinal judgments. However, when ordinal judgment was used to retrospectively decode memory representations of absolute orientations, striking aspects of absolute judgments, including the correlation and forward/backward aftereffects between two reported orientations in a trial, were explained. We propose that the brain prioritizes decoding of higher-level features because they are more behaviorally relevant, and more invariant and categorical, and thus easier to specify and maintain in noisy working memory, and that more reliable higher-level decoding constrains less reliable lower-level decoding.",

There is an important need to determine diagnostic and prognostic markers for this disease. Eph receptors are the largest known family of receptor tyrosines characterised in humans. These receptors are involved in the development and progression of various diseases including cancer. EphB6 contains kinase domains that are altered in several conserved amino acids and is catalytically inactive. The aim of the present study was to correlate the immunohistological expression of EphB6 in a cohort of patients with epithelial ovarian tumours with clinicopathological parameters and survival.",

        "Title": "Solving stereo transparency with an extended coarse-to-fine disparity energy model.",
        "Abstract": "Modeling stereo transparency with physiologically plausible mechanisms is challenging because in such frameworks, large receptive fields mix up overlapping disparities, whereas small receptive fields can reliably compute only small disparities. It seems necessary to combine information across scales. A coarse-to-fine disparity energy model, with both position- and phase-shift receptive fields, has already been proposed. However, because each scale decodes only one disparity for each location and uses the decoded disparity to select cells at the next scale, this model cannot represent overlapping surfaces at different depths. We have extended the model to solve stereo transparency. First, we introduce multiplicative connections from cells at one scale to the next to implement coarse-to-fine computation. The connection is the strongest when the presynaptic cell's preferred disparity matches the postsynaptic cell's position-shift parameter, encouraging the next scale to encode residual disparities with the more reliable phase-shift mechanism. This modification not only eliminates the artificial decoding and selection steps of the original model but also enables maintenance of complete population responses throughout the coarse-to-fine process. Second, because of this modification, explicit decoding is no longer necessary but rather is for visualization only. We use a simple threshold criterion to decode multiple disparities from population energy responses instead of a single disparity in the original model. We demonstrate our model using simulations on a variety of transparent and nontransparent stereograms. The model also reproduces psychophysically observed disparity interactions (averaging, thickening, attraction, and repulsion) as the depth separation between two overlapping planes varies.",

        "Abstract": "A wealth of studies has found that adapting to second-order visual stimuli has little effect on the perception of first-order stimuli. This is physiologically and psychologically troubling, since many cells show similar tuning to both classes of stimuli, and since adapting to first-order stimuli leads to aftereffects that do generalize to second-order stimuli. Focusing on high-level visual stimuli, we recently proposed the novel explanation that the lack of transfer arises partially from the characteristically different backgrounds of the two stimulus classes. Here, we consider the effect of stimulus backgrounds in the far more prevalent, lower-level, case of the orientation tilt aftereffect. Using a variety of first- and second-order oriented stimuli, we show that we could increase or decrease both within- and cross-class adaptation aftereffects by increasing or decreasing the similarity of the otherwise apparently uninteresting or irrelevant backgrounds of adapting and test patterns. Our results suggest that similarity between background statistics of the adapting and test stimuli contributes to low-level visual adaptation, and that these backgrounds are thus not discarded by visual processing but provide contextual modulation of adaptation. Null cross-adaptation aftereffects must also be interpreted cautiously. These findings reduce the apparent inconsistency between psychophysical and neurophysiological data about first- and second-order stimuli.",

        "Title": "Movement duration, Fitts's law, and an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model for biological motor systems.",
        "Abstract": "Optimization models explain many aspects of biological goal-directed movements. However, most such models use a finite-horizon formulation, which requires a prefixed movement duration to define a cost function and solve the optimization problem. To predict movement duration, these models have to be run multiple times with different prefixed durations until an appropriate duration is found by trial and error. The constrained minimum time model directly predicts movement duration; however, it does not consider sensory feedback and is thus applicable only to open-loop movements. To address these problems, we analyzed and simulated an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model, with linear plants, that contains both control-dependent and control-independent noise and optimizes steady-state accuracy and energetic costs per unit time. The model applies the steady-state estimator and controller continuously to guide an effector to, and keep it at, target position. As such, it integrates movement control and posture maintenance without artificially dividing them with a precise, prefixed time boundary. Movement pace is determined by the model parameters, and the duration is an emergent property with trial-to-trial variability. By considering the mean duration, we derived both the log and power forms of Fitts's law as different approximations of the model. Moreover, the model reproduces typically observed velocity profiles and occasional transient overshoots. For unbiased sensory feedback, the effector reaches the target without bias, in contrast to finite-horizon models that systematically undershoot target when energetic cost is considered. Finally, the model does not involve backward and forward sweeps in time, its stability is easily checked, and the same solution applies to movements of different initial conditions and distances. We argue that biological systems could use steady-state solutions as default control mechanisms and might seek additional optimization of transient costs when justified or demanded by task or context.",

        "Title": "Multi-level visual adaptation: dissociating curvature and facial-expression aftereffects produced by the same adapting stimuli.",
        "Abstract": "Adaptation aftereffects offer a critical window onto sensory processing in the brain. However, such sensory processing is hierarchical, progressing from the extraction of simple features to the representation of complex patterns. The way that adaptation depends on coordinated changes across different levels of the hierarchy has been studied. However, when a given adapting stimulus produces both a low- and a high-level aftereffect, it remains unclear whether the high-level aftereffect is a passive reflection of low-level adaptation, or whether it is generated, at least partially, de novo in high-level areas. We assembled the two key ingredients needed for investigating this question psychophysically. One ingredient involves perceptual tasks that depend rather exclusively on low or high levels of processing, and yet involve partially identical stimuli that inspire cross-level adaptation. For this, we considered the discrimination of curvature or facial expression using curves or cartoon faces. The other ingredient is spatial or temporal stimulus manipulations that limit adaptation to either low or high levels. For this, we used crowding and brief presentations. We found that crowding an adapting curve with flanking curves reduces the curvature aftereffect much more than the facial-expression aftereffect, and vice versa for crowding the adapting face with flanking faces. Additionally, reducing adaptation time to a cartoon face diminishes the curvature aftereffect more drastically than the facial-expression aftereffect. These results suggest that high-level aftereffects, even when generated by a low-level adaptor, are not completely inherited from lower levels, and offer a window into the determining factors.",

The dynamic changes in different parts of digestive system including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, and rectum in healthy and infected rabbits at different time points were also tested. The intestinal microbial community of the control healthy rabbits was steady, and the total number of ERIC-PCR bands in the control healthy rabbit was the least in the rectum and the most in the caecum. ERIC-PCR bands of orally inoculated rabbits did not obviously change until 24 h after postinoculation (p.i.). The numbers of the ERIC-PCR bands gradually decreased from 24 to 72 h p.i., and then, with the development of disease, the band numbers gradually increased until 6 days p.i. Sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 1,200 bp of infected ileum sampled at 32 h p.i. were above 95 % with Sinorhizobium meliloti enterobacterial, Erwinia amylovora and Salmonella typhimurium, and the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 300 bp of infected ileum sampled at 48 h p.i. were more than 90 % with Xanthomonas campestris enterobacterial, Yersinia enterocolitica subsp., Shigella flexneri, S. meliloti enterobacterial, Yersinia pestis, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp., and Escherichia coli. The prominent bacteria had changed after E. histolytica infection.

        "Title": "A learning-style theory for understanding autistic behaviors.",
        "Abstract": "Understanding autism's ever-expanding array of behaviors, from sensation to cognition, is a major challenge. We posit that autistic and typically developing brains implement different algorithms that are better suited to learn, represent, and process different tasks; consequently, they develop different interests and behaviors. Computationally, a continuum of algorithms exists, from lookup table (LUT) learning, which aims to store experiences precisely, to interpolation (INT) learning, which focuses on extracting underlying statistical structure (regularities) from experiences. We hypothesize that autistic and typical brains, respectively, are biased toward LUT and INT learning, in low- and high-dimensional feature spaces, possibly because of their narrow and broad tuning functions. The LUT style is good at learning relationships that are local, precise, rigid, and contain little regularity for generalization (e.g., the name-number association in a phonebook). However, it is poor at learning relationships that are context dependent, noisy, flexible, and do contain regularities for generalization (e.g., associations between gaze direction and intention, language and meaning, sensory input and interpretation, motor-control signal and movement, and social situation and proper response). The LUT style poorly compresses information, resulting in inefficiency, sensory overload (overwhelm), restricted interests, and resistance to change. It also leads to poor prediction and anticipation, frequent surprises and over-reaction (hyper-sensitivity), impaired attentional selection and switching, concreteness, strong local focus, weak adaptation, and superior and inferior performances on simple and complex tasks. The spectrum nature of autism can be explained by different degrees of LUT learning among different individuals, and in different systems of the same individual. Our theory suggests that therapy should focus on training autistic LUT algorithm to learn regularities.",

        "Abstract": "This research was undertaken to determine the population of a high-virulence strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in partridge by a fluorescent quencher PCR assay and to correlate these findings with the results obtained from the immunohistochemical localization and histopathological examinations of selected Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis-infected tissues. To make the results meaningful, a side-by-side bacteriology method (indirect immuno-fluorescent antibody staining) was performed too. The results of indirect immuno-fluorescent antibody staining and immunohistochemical localization were similar to the fluorescent quencher PCR assay. The time course of the appearance of bacterial antigens and tissue lesions in various tissues was coincident with the levels of the bacterial DNA loads at the infection sites. This suggests that Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis loads in internal organs are closely correlated with the progression of the infection.",

        "Title": "V1 orientation plasticity is explained by broadly tuned feedforward inputs and intracortical sharpening.",
        "Abstract": "Orientation adaptation and perceptual learning change orientation tuning curves of V1 cells. Adaptation shifts tuning curve peaks away from the adapted orientation, reduces tuning curve slopes near the adapted orientation, and increases the responses on the far flank of tuning curves. Learning an orientation discrimination task increases tuning curve slopes near the trained orientation. These changes have been explained previously in a recurrent model (RM) of orientation selectivity. However, the RM generates only complex cells when they are well tuned, so that there is currently no model of orientation plasticity for simple cells. In addition, some feedforward models, such as the modified feedforward model (MFM), also contain recurrent cortical excitation, and it is unknown whether they can explain plasticity. Here, we compare plasticity in the MFM, which simulates simple cells, and a recent modification of the RM (MRM), which displays a continuum of simple-to-complex characteristics. Both pre- and postsynaptic-based modifications of the recurrent and feedforward connections in the models are investigated. The MRM can account for all the learning- and adaptation-induced plasticity, for both simple and complex cells, while the MFM cannot. The key features from the MRM required for explaining plasticity are broadly tuned feedforward inputs and sharpening by a Mexican hat intracortical interaction profile. The mere presence of recurrent cortical interactions in feedforward models like the MFM is insufficient; such models have more rigid tuning curves. We predict that the plastic properties must be absent for cells whose orientation tuning arises from a feedforward mechanism.",

        "Title": "The role of background statistics in face adaptation.",
        "Abstract": "Cross-adaptation is widely used to probe whether different stimuli share common neural mechanisms. For example, that adaptation to second-order stimuli usually produces little aftereffect on first-order stimuli has been interpreted as reflecting their separate processing. However, such results appear to contradict the cue-invariant responses of many visual cells. We tested the novel hypothesis that the null aftereffect arises from the large difference in the backgrounds of first- and second-order stimuli. We created second-order faces with happy and sad facial expressions specified solely by local directions of moving random dots on a static-dot background, without any luminance-defined form cues. As expected, adaptation to such a second-order face did not produce a facial-expression aftereffect on the first-order faces. However, consistent with our hypothesis, simply adding static random dots to the first-order faces to render their backgrounds more similar to that of the adapting motion face led to a significant aftereffect. This background similarity effect also occurred between different types of first-order stimuli: real-face adaptation transferred to cartoon faces only when noise with correlation statistics of real faces or natural images was added to the cartoon faces. These findings suggest the following: (1) statistical similarities between the featureless backgrounds of the adapting and test stimuli can influence aftereffects, as in contingent adaptation; (2) weak or null cross-adaptation aftereffects should be interpreted with caution; and (3) luminance- and motion-direction-defined forms, and local features and global statistics, converge in the representation of faces.",

        "Abstract": "Pulfrich phenomena are a class of depth illusions generated by an interocular time delay. This may be demonstrated with continuously moving stimuli, stroboscopic displays undergoing apparent motion, or dynamic noise patterns. Previous studies suggest that neurons jointly tuned to motion and disparity may be responsible for the phenomena. Model cells with such joint coding can explain all Pulfrich phenomena in a unified way (N. Qian & R. A. Andersen, 1997). However, the joint-coding idea has been challenged by recent models (J. C. Read & B. G. Cumming, 2005a, 2005c) that focus on the S shaped functions of perceived disparity in stroboscopic Pulfrich effect (M. J. Morgan, 1979). Here we demonstrate fundamental problems with the recent models in terms of causality, physiological plausibility, and definitions for joint and separate coding, and we compare the two coding schemes under physiologically plausible assumptions. We show that joint coding of disparity and either unidirectional or bidirectional motion selectivity can account for the S curves, but unidirectional selectivity is required to explain direction-depth contingency in Pulfrich effects. In contrast, separate coding can explain neither the S curves nor the direction-depth contingency. We conclude that Pulfrich phenomena are logically accounted for by joint encoding of unidirectional-motion and disparity.",

        "Title": "Adaptation across the cortical hierarchy: low-level curve adaptation affects high-level facial-expression judgments.",
        "Abstract": "Adaptation is ubiquitous in sensory processing. Although sensory processing is hierarchical, with neurons at higher levels exhibiting greater degrees of tuning complexity and invariance than those at lower levels, few experimental or theoretical studies address how adaptation at one hierarchical level affects processing at others. Nevertheless, this issue is critical for understanding cortical coding and computation. Therefore, we examined whether perception of high-level facial expressions can be affected by adaptation to low-level curves (i.e., the shape of a mouth). After adapting to a concave curve, subjects more frequently perceived faces as happy, and after adapting to a convex curve, subjects more frequently perceived faces as sad. We observed this multilevel aftereffect with both cartoon and real test faces when the adapting curve and the mouths of the test faces had the same location. However, when we placed the adapting curve 0.2 degrees below the test faces, the effect disappeared. Surprisingly, this positional specificity held even when real faces, instead of curves, were the adapting stimuli, suggesting that it is a general property for facial-expression aftereffects. We also studied the converse question of whether face adaptation affects curvature judgments, and found such effects after adapting to a cartoon face, but not a real face. Our results suggest that there is a local component in facial-expression representation, in addition to holistic representations emphasized in previous studies. By showing that adaptation can propagate up the cortical hierarchy, our findings also challenge existing functional accounts of adaptation.",

        "Abstract": "Just as China has struggled with bringing an expanding economy to a country with large areas of economic underdevelopment, the Chinese health care system is experiencing tension between tradition and modernization. Because of this tension, health care in the Peoples' Republic of China has been undergoing significant reform since the beginning of the 1980s. Experiments in market-based health systems have been unsuccessful and have exacerbated disparities. New reforms, announced in 2006, stress the role of family physicians in leading the health care system. This paper discusses the history of the developments that led up to the new reforms and the educational challenges of training sufficient numbers of family physicians to meet the requirements of the new system.",

        "Title": "Solving da Vinci stereopsis with depth-edge-selective V2 cells.",
        "Abstract": "We propose a new model for da Vinci stereopsis based on a coarse-to-fine disparity energy computation in V1 and disparity-boundary-selective units in V2. Unlike previous work, our model contains only binocular cells, relies on distributed representations of disparity, and has a simple V1-to-V2 feedforward structure. We demonstrate with random-dot stereograms that the V2 stage of our model is able to determine the location and the eye-of-origin of monocularly occluded regions, and improve disparity map computation. We also examine a few related issues. First, we argue that since monocular regions are binocularly defined, they cannot generally be detected by monocular cells. Second, we show that our coarse-to-fine V1 model for conventional stereopsis explains double matching in Panum's limiting case. This provides computational support to the notion that the perceived depth of a monocular bar next to a binocular rectangle may not be da Vinci stereopsis per se [Gillam, B., Cook, M., & Blackburn, S. (2003). Monocular discs in the occlusion zones of binocular surfaces do not have quantitative depth--a comparison with Panum's limiting case. Perception 32, 1009-1019.]. Third, we demonstrate that some stimuli previously deemed invalid have simple, valid geometric interpretations. Our work suggests that studies of da Vinci stereopsis should focus on stimuli more general than the bar-and-rectangle type and that disparity-boundary-selective V2 cells may provide a simple physiological mechanism for da Vinci stereopsis.",

        "Abstract": "It has been shown that motion aftereffect (MAE) not only is present at the adapted location but also partially transfers to nearby non-adapted locations. However, it is not clear whether MAE transfers across the fixation point. Since cells in area MSTd have receptive fields that cover both sides of the fixation point and since many MSTd cells, but not cells in earlier visual areas, prefer complex motion patterns such as expansion, we tested cross-fixation transfer of MAE induced by expanding random-dots stimuli. We also used rightward translational motion for comparison. Subjects adapted to motion patterns on a fixed side of the fixation point. Dynamic MAE was then measured with a nulling procedure at both the adapted site and the mirror site across the fixation point. Subjects' eye fixation during stimulus presentation was monitored with an infrared eye tracker. At the adapted site, both the expansion and the translation patterns generated strong MAEs, as expected. However, only the expansion pattern, but not translation pattern, generated significant MAE at the mirror site. This remained true even after we adjusted stimulus parameters to equate the strengths of the expansion MAE and translation MAE at the adapted site. We conclude that there is cross-fixation transfer of MAE for expansion motion but not for translational motion.",

        "Title": "Comparison among some models of orientation selectivity.",
        "Abstract": "Several models exist for explaining primary visual cortex (V1) orientation tuning. The modified feedforward model (MFM) and the recurrent model (RM) are major examples. We have implemented these two models, at the same level of detail, alongside a few newer variations, and thoroughly compared their receptive-field structures. We found that antiphase inhibition in the MFM enhances both spatial phase information and orientation tuning, producing well-tuned simple cells. This remains true for a newer version of the MFM that incorporates untuned complex-cell inhibition. In contrast, when the recurrent connections in the RM are strong enough to produce typical V1 orientation tuning, they also eliminate spatial phase information, making the cells complex. Introducing phase specificity into the connections of the RM (as done in an original version of the RM) can make the cells phase sensitive, but the cells show an incorrect 90 degrees peak shift of orientation tuning under opposite contrast signs. An inhibition-dominant version of the RM can generate well-tuned cells across the simple-complex spectrum, but it predicts that the net effect of cortical interactions is to suppress feedforward excitation across all orientations in simple cells. Finally, adding antiphase inhibition used in the MFM into the RM produces a most general model. We call this new model the modified recurrent model (MRM) and show that this model can also produce well-tuned cells throughout the simple-complex spectrum. Unlike the inhibition-dominant RM, the MRM is consistent with data from cat V1, suggesting that the net effect of cortical interactions is to boost simple cell responses at the preferred orientation. These results suggest that the MFM is well suited for explaining orientation tuning in simple cells, whereas the standard RM is for complex cells. The assignment of the RM to complex cells also avoids conflicts between the RM and the experiments of cortical inactivation (done on simple cells) and the spatial-frequency dependency of orientation tuning (found in simple cells). Because orientation-tuned V1 cells show a continuum of simple- to complex-cell behavior, the MRM provides the best description of V1 data.",

        "Title": "An optimization principle for determining movement duration.",
        "Abstract": "Movement duration is an integral component of motor control, but nearly all extant optimization models of motor planning prefix duration instead of explaining it. Here we propose a new optimization principle that predicts movement duration. The model assumes that the brain attempts to minimize movement duration under the constraint of meeting an accuracy criterion. The criterion is task and context dependent but is fixed for a given task and context. The model determines a unique duration as a trade-off between speed (time optimality) and accuracy (acceptable endpoint scatter). We analyzed the model for a linear motor plant, and obtained a closed-form equation for determining movement duration. By solving the equation numerically with specific plant parameters for the eye and arm, we found that the model can reproduce saccade duration as a function of amplitude (the main sequence), and arm-movement duration as a function of the ratio of target distance to size (Fitts's law). In addition, it explains the dependency of peak saccadic speed on amplitude and the dependency of saccadic duration on initial eye position. Furthermore, for arm movements, the model predicts a scaling relationship between peak velocity and distance and a reduction in movement duration with a moderate increase in viscosity. Finally, for a linear plant, our model predicts a neural control signal identical to that of the minimum-variance model set to the same movement duration. This control signal is a smooth function of time (except at the endpoint), in contrast to the discontinuous bang-bang control found in the time-optimal control literature. We suggest that one aspect of movement planning, as revealed by movement duration, may be to assign an endpoint accuracy criterion for a given task and context.",

        "Abstract": "Observers can better discriminate orientation or direction near the cardinal axes than near an oblique axis. We investigated whether this well-known oblique effect is determined by the physical or the perceived axis of the stimuli. Using the simultaneous tilt illusion, we generated perceptually different orientations for the same inner (target) grating by contrasting it with differently oriented outer gratings. Subjects compared the target orientation with a set of reference orientations. If orientation discriminability was determined by the physical orientations, the psychometric curves for the same target grating would be identical. Instead, all subjects produced steeper curves when perceiving target gratings near vertically as opposed to more obliquely. This result of orientation discrimination was confirmed by using adaptation-generated tilt aftereffect to manipulate the perceived orientation of a given physical orientation. Moreover, we obtained the same result in direction discrimination by using motion repulsion to alter the perceived direction of a given physical direction. We conclude that when the perceived orientation or direction differs from the physical orientation or direction, the oblique effect depends on perceived, rather than physical, orientation or direction. Finally, as a by-product of the study, we found that, around the vertical direction, motion repulsion is much stronger when the inducing direction is more clockwise to the test direction than when it is more counterclockwise.",

        "Abstract": "Motion repulsion involves interaction between two directions of motion. Since attention is known to bias interactions among different stimuli, we investigated the effect of attentional tasks on motion repulsion. We used two overlapping sets of random dots moving in different directions. When subjects had to detect a small speed-change or luminance change for dots along one direction, the repulsive influence from the other direction was significantly reduced compared with the control case without attentional tasks. However, when the speed-change could occur to either direction such that subjects had to attend both directions to detect the change, motion repulsion was not different from the control. A further experiment showed that decreasing the difficulty of the attentional task resulted in the disappearance of the attentional effect in the case of attention to one direction. Finally, over a wide range of contrasts for the unattended direction, attention reduced repulsion measured with the attended direction. These results are consistent with the physiological finding that strong attention to one direction of motion reduces inhibitory effects from the other direction.",

        "Title": "Is depth perception of stereo plaids predicted by intersection of constraints, vector average or second-order feature?",
        "Abstract": "Stereo plaid stimuli were created to investigate whether depth perception is determined by an intersection of constraints (IOC) or vector average (VA) operation on the Fourier components, or by the second-order (non-Fourier) feature in a pattern. We first created stereo plaid stimuli where IOC predicted vertical disparity, VA predicted positive diagonal disparity and the second-order feature predicted negative diagonal disparity. In a depth discrimination task, observers indicated whether they perceived the pattern as 'near' or 'far' relative to a zero-disparity aperture. Observers' perception was consistent with the disparity predicted by VA, indicating its dominance over IOC and the second-order feature in this condition. Additional stimuli in which VA predicted vertical disparity were created to investigate whether VA would dominate perception when it was a less reliable cue. In this case, observers' performance was consistent with disparity predicted by IOC or the second-order feature, not VA. Finally, in order to determine whether the second-order feature contributes to depth perception, stimuli were created where IOC and VA predicted positive horizontal disparity while the second-order feature predicted negative horizontal disparity. When the component gratings were oriented near horizontal (+/-83 degrees from vertical), depth perception corresponded to that predicted by the second-order feature. However, as the components moved away from horizontal (+/-75 degrees and +/-65 degrees from vertical), depth perception was increasingly likely to be predicted by an IOC or VA operation. These experiments suggest that the visual system does not rely exclusively on a single method for computing pattern disparity. Instead, it favours the most reliable method for a given condition.",

        "Title": "Different predictions by the minimum variance and minimum torque-change models on the skewness of movement velocity profiles.",
        "Abstract": "We investigated the differences between two well-known optimization principles for understanding movement planning: the minimum variance (MV) model of Harris and Wolpert (1998) and the minimum torque change (MTC) model of Uno, Kawato, and Suzuki (1989). Both models accurately describe the properties of human reaching movements in ordinary situations (e.g., nearly straight paths and bell-shaped velocity profiles). However, we found that the two models can make very different predictions when external forces are applied or when the movement duration is increased. We considered a second-order linear system for the motor plant that has been used previously to simulate eye movements and single-joint arm movements and were able to derive analytical solutions based on the MV and MTC assumptions. With the linear plant, the MTC model predicts that the movement velocity profile should always be symmetrical, independent of the external forces and movement duration. In contrast, the MV model strongly depends on the movement duration and the system's degree of stability; the latter in turn depends on the total forces. The MV model thus predicts a skewed velocity profile under many circumstances. For example, it predicts that the peak location should be skewed toward the end of the movement when the movement duration is increased in the absence of any elastic force. It also predicts that with appropriate viscous and elastic forces applied to increase system stability, the velocity profile should be skewed toward the beginning of the movement. The velocity profiles predicted by the MV model can even show oscillations when the plant becomes highly oscillatory. Our analytical and simulation results suggest specific experiments for testing the validity of the two models.",

        "Title": "A coarse-to-fine disparity energy model with both phase-shift and position-shift receptive field mechanisms.",
        "Abstract": "Numerous studies suggest that the visual system uses both phase- and position-shift receptive field (RF) mechanisms for the processing of binocular disparity. Although the difference between these two mechanisms has been analyzed before, previous work mainly focused on disparity tuning curves instead of population responses. However, tuning curve and population response can exhibit different characteristics, and it is the latter that determines disparity estimation. Here we demonstrate, in the framework of the disparity energy model, that for relatively small disparities, the population response generated by the phase-shift mechanism is more reliable than that generated by the position-shift mechanism. This is true over a wide range of parameters, including the RF orientation. Since the phase model has its own drawbacks of underestimating large stimulus disparity and covering only a restricted range of disparity at a given scale, we propose a coarse-to-fine algorithm for disparity computation with a hybrid of phase-shift and position-shift components. In this algorithm, disparity at each scale is always estimated by the phase-shift mechanism to take advantage of its higher reliability. Since the phase-based estimation is most accurate at the smallest scale when the disparity is correspondingly small, the algorithm iteratively reduces the input disparity from coarse to fine scales by introducing a constant position-shift component to all cells for a given location in order to offset the stimulus disparity at that location. The model also incorporates orientation pooling and spatial pooling to further enhance reliability. We have tested the algorithm on both synthetic and natural stereo images and found that it often performs better than a simple scale-averaging procedure.",

        "Abstract": "We studied perceptual learning in motion discrimination when the brain's middle temporal area (MT/V5) was functionally suppressed. This was achieved by using the \"paired-dots\" motion stimulus where the two dots in a pair always move in counter-phase over a short distance [J. Neurosci. 14 (1994) 7357]. The motion directional signal of the stimulus is therefore always 0 on average. As a result, this stimulus activates MT in Rhesus monkeys no more than flicker noise does [J. Neurosci. 14 (1994) 7367]. We added a new manipulation to eliminate the Glass pattern in the original stimulus that would have otherwise provided a static orientation cue. Two such new motion stimuli were presented sequentially, in a 2AFC task. Subjects decided if the global motion-axis of the stimuli changed clockwise or counter-clockwise. When the task difficulty was set at 60% correct, none of the subjects could learn with feedback, even though their performance was well above chance. However, when the task difficulty was set instead at 70% correct, a new group of subjects was able to learn. Hence, learning motion discrimination was possible when MT was presumably eliminated.",

        "Abstract": "There is an ongoing debate on whether binocular rivalry involves competition among monocular cells or binocular cells. We investigated this issue psychophysically with two specially designed test stimuli. One test stimulus contained monocular motion signals but greatly reduced binocular motion signals, while the other contained binocular motion signals but no monocular motion signals. For comparison, we also employed a normal rivalrous control containing both monocular and binocular motion signals, and a non-rivalrous flicker-noise control with neither monocular nor binocular motion signals. We found that binocular rivalry for the two test stimuli was significantly reduced compared with the normal rivalrous control, but not completely eliminated compared with the non-rivalrous control. Therefore, both monocular and binocular motion signals appear to contribute to motion rivalry, suggesting that motion rivalry must involve competition among both monocular and binocular cells.",

Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.",

        "Abstract": "Learning and adaptation in the domain of orientation processing are among the most studied topics in the literature. However, little effort has been devoted to explaining the diverse array of experimental findings via a physiologically based model. We have started to address this issue in the framework of the recurrent model of V1 orientation selectivity and found that reported changes in V1 orientation tuning curves after learning and adaptation can both be explained with the model. Specifically, the sharpening of orientation tuning curves near the trained orientation after learning can be accounted for by slightly reducing net excitatory connections to cells around the trained orientation, while the broadening and peak shift of the tuning curves after adaptation can be reproduced by appropriately scaling down both excitation and inhibition around the adapted orientation. In addition, we investigated the perceptual consequences of the tuning curve changes induced by learning and adaptation using signal detection theory. We found that in the case of learning, the physiological changes can account for the psychophysical data well. In the case of adaptation, however, there is a clear discrepancy between the psychophysical data from alert human subjects and the physiological data from anesthetized animals. Instead, human adaptation studies can be better accounted for by the learning data from behaving animals. Our work suggests that adaptation in behaving subjects may be viewed as a short-term form of learning.",

        "Abstract": "It has been known since the time of Helmholtz that vertical differences between the two retinal images can generate depth perception. Although many ecologically and geometrically inspired theories have been proposed, the neural mechanisms underlying the phenomenon remain elusive. Here we propose a new theory for depth perception from vertical disparity based on the oriented binocular receptive fields of visual cortical cells and on the radial bias of the preferred-orientation distribution in the cortex. The theory suggests that oriented cells may treat a vertical disparity as a weaker, equivalent horizontal disparity. It explains the induced effect, and the quadrant and size dependence of vertical disparity. It predicts that horizontal and vertical disparities should locally enhance or cancel each other according to their depth signs, and that the effect of vertical disparity should be orientation dependent. These predictions were confirmed through psychophysical experiments.",

        "Title": "Computing relief structure from motion with a distributed velocity and disparity representation.",
        "Abstract": "Recent psychophysical experiments suggest that humans can recover only relief structure from motion (SFM); i.e., an object's 3D shape can only be determined up to a stretching transformation along the line of sight. Here we propose a physiologically plausible model for the computation of relief SFM, which is also applicable to the related problem of motion parallax. We assume that the perception of depth from motion is related to the firing of a subset of MT neurons tuned to both velocity and disparity. The model MT neurons are connected to each other laterally to form modulatory interactions. The overall connectivity is such that when a zero-disparity velocity pattern is fed into the system, the most responsive neurons are not those tuned to zero disparity, but instead are those having preferred disparities consistent with the relief structure of the velocity pattern. The model computes the correct relief structure under a wide range of parameters and can also reproduce the SFM illusions involving coaxial cylinders. It is consistent with the psychophysical observation that subjects with stereo impairment are also deficient in perceiving motion parallax, and with the physiological data that the responses of direction- and disparity-tuned MT cells covary with the perceived surface order of bistable SFM stimuli.",

        "Abstract": "Recently it was found that noise could help improve human detection of sensory stimuli via stochastic-resonance-type behavior. Specifically, the ability of an individual to detect a weak tactile stimulus could be enhanced by adding a certain amount of noise. Here we propose, from the perspective of classical signal detection theory, a simple and general model to elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. We demonstrate that noise-mediated enhancements and decrements in human sensation can be well reproduced by our model. The predicted upper bound of the performance improvement by adding noise is also consistent with the experimental data. We suggest additional experiments to further test the model.",
