        "Abstract": "Intestinal transplantation (ITx) is highly immunogenic, resulting in the need for high levels of immunosuppression, with frequent complications along with high rejection rates. Tolerance induction would provide a solution to these limitations. Detailed studies of alloreactive T cell clones as well as multiparameter flow cytometry in the graft and peripheral tissues have provided evidence for several tolerance mechanisms that occur spontaneously following ITx, which might provide targets for further interventions. These include the frequent occurrence of macrochimerism and engraftment in the recipient bone marrow of donor hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells carried in the allograft. These phenomena are seen most frequently in recipients of multivisceral transplants and are associated with reduced rejection rates. They reflect powerful graft-vs-host responses that enter the peripheral lymphoid system and bone marrow after expanding within and emigrating from the allograft. Several mechanisms of tolerance that may result from this lymphohematopoietic graft-vs-host response are discussed. Transcriptional profiling in quiescent allografts reveals tolerization of pre-existing host-vs-graft-reactive T cells that enter the allograft mucosa and become tissue-resident memory cells. Dissection of the pathways driving and maintaining this tolerant tissue-resident state among donor-reactive T cells will allow controlled tolerance induction through specific therapeutic approaches.",

        "Abstract": "The site of transition between tissue-resident memory (TRM) and circulating phenotypes of T cells is unknown. We integrated clonotype, alloreactivity, and gene expression profiles of graft-repopulating recipient T cells in the intestinal mucosa at the single-cell level after human intestinal transplantation. Host-versus-graft (HvG)-reactive T cells were mainly distributed to TRM, effector T (Teff)/TRM, and T follicular helper compartments. RNA velocity analysis demonstrated a trajectory from TRM to Teff/TRM clusters in association with rejection. By integrating pre- and post-transplantation (Tx) mixed lymphocyte reaction-determined alloreactive repertoires, we observed that pre-existing HvG-reactive T cells that demonstrated tolerance in the circulation were dominated by TRM profiles in quiescent allografts. Putative de novo HvG-reactive clones showed a transcriptional profile skewed to cytotoxic effectors in rejecting grafts. Inferred protein regulon network analysis revealed upstream regulators that accounted for the effector and tolerant T cell states. We demonstrate Teff/TRM interchangeability for individual T cell clones with known (allo)recognition in the human gut, providing novel insight into TRM biology.",

        "Abstract": "It is unknown how intestinal B cell populations and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires are established and maintained over time in humans. Following intestinal transplantation (ITx), surveillance ileal mucosal biopsies provide a unique opportunity to map the dynamic establishment of gut lymphocyte populations. Using polychromatic flow cytometry that includes HLA allele group-specific mAbs distinguishing donor from recipient cells along with high throughput BCR sequencing, we tracked the establishment of recipient B cell populations and BCR repertoire in the allograft mucosa of ITx recipients. We confirm the early presence of naïve donor B cells in the circulation and, for the first time, document the establishment of recipient B cell populations, including B resident memory cells, in the intestinal allograft mucosa. Recipient B cell repopulation of the allograft was most rapid in infant (<1 year old)-derived allografts and, unlike T cell repopulation, did not correlate with rejection rates. While recipient memory B cell populations were increased in graft mucosa compared to circulation, naïve recipient B cells remained detectable in the graft mucosa for years. Comparisons of peripheral and intra-mucosal B cell repertoires in the absence of rejection revealed increased BCR mutation rates and clonal expansion in graft mucosa compared to circulating B cells, but these parameters did not increase markedly after the first year post-transplant. Furthermore, clonal mixing between the allograft mucosa and the circulation was significantly greater in ITx recipients, even years after transplantation, than in healthy control adults. Collectively, our data demonstrate intestinal mucosal B cell repertoire establishment from a circulating pool, a process that continues for years without evidence of establishment of a stable mucosal B cell repertoire.",

        "Abstract": "Mixed allogeneic chimerism has considerable potential to advance the achievement of immune tolerance to alloantigens for transplantation and the restoration of self-tolerance in patients with autoimmune disease. In this article, I review evidence that graft-versus-host (GVH) alloreactivity without graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), termed a lymphohematopoietic graft-vs-host reaction (LGVHR), can promote the induction of mixed chimerism with minimal toxicity. LGVHR was originally shown to occur in an animal model when non-tolerant donor lymphocytes were administered to mixed chimeras in the absence of inflammatory stimuli and was found to mediate powerful graft-vs-leukemia/lymphoma effects without GVHD. Recent large animal studies suggest a role for LGVHR in promoting durable mixed chimerism and the demonstration that LGVHR promotes chimerism in human intestinal allograft recipients has led to a pilot study aiming to achieve durable mixed chimerism.",

        "Abstract": "A major limitation of organ allotransplantation is the insufficient supply of donor organs. Consequently, thousands of patients die every year while waiting for a transplant. Progress in xenotransplantation that has permitted pig organ graft survivals of years in non-human primates has led to renewed excitement about the potential of this approach to alleviate the organ shortage. In 2022, the first pig-to-human heart transplant was performed on a compassionate use basis, and xenotransplantation experiments using pig kidneys in deceased human recipients provided encouraging data. Many advances in xenotransplantation have resulted from improvements in the ability to genetically modify pigs using CRISPR-Cas9 and other methodologies. Gene editing has the capacity to generate pig organs that more closely resemble those of humans and are hence more physiologically compatible and less prone to rejection. Despite such modifications, immune responses to xenografts remain powerful and multi-faceted, involving innate immune components that do not attack allografts. Thus, the induction of innate and adaptive immune tolerance to prevent rejection while preserving the capacity of the immune system to protect the recipient and the graft from infection is desirable to enable clinical xenotransplantation.",

        "Abstract": "The authors of this article, all women who have been deeply committed to the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies (FOCIS), performed a retrospective analysis of gender equality practices of FOCIS to identify areas for improvement and make recommendations accordingly. Gender data were obtained and analyzed for the period from January 2010 to July 2021. Outcome measures included numbers of men and women across the following categories: membership enrollment, meeting and course faculty and attendees, committee and leadership composition. FOCIS' past and present leaders, steering committee members, FCE directors, individual members, as well as education, annual meeting scientific program and FCE committee members and management staff of FOCIS were surveyed by email questionnaire for feedback on FOCIS policies and practice with respect to gender equality and inclusion. Although women represent 50% of the membership, they have been underrepresented in all leadership, educational, and committee roles within the FOCIS organization. Surveying FOCIS leadership and membership revealed a growing recognition of disparities in female leadership across all FOCIS missions, leading to significant improvement in multiple areas since 2016. We highlight these changes and propose a number of recommendations that can be used by FOCIS to improve gender equality.",

The codebase includes user-friendly default analyses with customizable parameters which greatly accelerate computational workflows and provide robust statistics comparing post-transplant specimens to pre-transplant baseline. It also includes helper functions for robust characterization of T-cell-repertoire diversity, sample-to-sample divergence, resolution of sample-of-origin ambiguity in pooled assays, and functions to output all sequences defined as alloreactive.",

        "Title": "Chimerism-Based Tolerance to Kidney Allografts in Humans: Novel Insights and Future Perspectives.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic rejection and immunosuppression-related toxicity severely affect long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation. The induction of transplantation tolerance - the lack of destructive immune responses to a transplanted organ in the absence of immunosuppression - could potentially overcome these limitations. Immune tolerance to kidney allografts from living donors has been successfully achieved in humans through clinical protocols based on chimerism induction with hematopoietic cell transplantation after non-myeloablative conditioning. Notably, two of these protocols have led to immune tolerance in a significant fraction of HLA-mismatched donor-recipient combinations, which represent the large majority of cases in clinical practice. Studies in mice and large animals have been critical in dissecting tolerance mechanisms and in selecting the most promising approaches for human translation. However, there are several key differences in tolerance induction between these models and humans, including the rate of success and stability of donor chimerism, as well as the relative contribution of different mechanisms in inducing donor-specific unresponsiveness. Kidney allograft tolerance achieved through durable full-donor chimerism may be due to central deletion of graft-reactive donor T cells, even though mechanistic data from patient series are lacking. On the other hand, immune tolerance attained with transient mixed chimerism-based protocols initially relies on Treg-mediated suppression, followed by peripheral deletion of donor-reactive recipient T-cell clones under antigenic pressure from the graft. These conclusions were supported by data deriving from novel high-throughput T-cell receptor sequencing approaches that allowed tracking of alloreactive repertoires over time. In this review, we summarize the most important mechanistic studies on tolerance induction with combined kidney-bone marrow transplantation in humans, discussing open issues that still need to be addressed and focusing on techniques developed in recent years to efficiently monitor the alloresponse in tolerance trials. These cutting-edge methods will be instrumental for the development of immune tolerance protocols with improved efficacy and to identify patients amenable to safe immunosuppression withdrawal.",

        "Abstract": "In this review, we summarize and discuss recent advances in understanding the characteristics of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) in the context of solid organ transplantation (SOT). We first introduce the traditionally understood noncirculating features of TRMs and the key phenotypic markers that define this population, then provide a detailed discussion of emerging concepts on the recirculation and plasticity of TRM in mice and humans. We comment on the potential heterogeneity of transient, temporary resident, and permanent resident T cells and potential interchangeable phenotypes between TRM and effector T cells in nonlymphoid tissues. We review the literature on the distribution of TRM in human nonlymphoid organs and association of clinical outcomes in different types of SOT, including intestine, lung, liver, kidney, and heart. We focus on both tissue-specific and organ-shared features of donor- and recipient-derived TRMs after transplantation whenever applicable. Studies with comprehensive sample collection, including longitudinal and cross-sectional controls, and applied advanced techniques such as multicolor flow cytometry to distinguish donor and recipient TRMs, bulk, and single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing to track clonotypes and define transcriptome profiles, and functional readouts to define alloreactivity and proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory activities are emphasized. We also discuss important findings on the tissue-resident features of regulatory αβ T cells and unconventional γδ T cells after transplantation. Understanding of TRM in SOT is a rapidly growing field that urges future studies to address unresolved questions regarding their heterogeneity, plasticity, longevity, alloreactivity, and roles in rejection and tolerance.",

In this article, we discuss the use of HTS of TCRs to discern the factors controlling human T cell repertoire development and how this approach can be used in combination with human immune system (HIS) mouse models to understand human repertoire selection in an unprecedented manner. An exceptionally high proportion of human T cells has alloreactive potential, which can best be understood as a consequence of the processes governing thymic selection. High throughput TCR sequencing has allowed assessment of the development, magnitude and nature of the human alloresponse at a new level and has provided a tool for tracking the fate of pre-transplant-defined donor- and host-reactive TCRs following transplantation. New insights into human allograft rejection and tolerance obtained with this method in combination with single cell transcriptional analyses are reviewed here.",

        "Abstract": "In humans receiving intestinal transplantation (ITx), long-term multilineage blood chimerism often develops. Donor T cell macrochimerism (≥4%) frequently occurs without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is associated with reduced rejection. Here we demonstrate that patients with macrochimerism had high graft-versus-host (GvH) to host-versus-graft (HvG) T cell clonal ratios in their allografts. These GvH clones entered the circulation, where their peak levels were associated with declines in HvG clones early after transplant, suggesting that GvH reactions may contribute to chimerism and control HvG responses without causing GVHD. Consistently, donor-derived T cells, including GvH clones, and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were simultaneously detected in the recipients' BM more than 100 days after transplant. Individual GvH clones appeared in ileal mucosa or PBMCs before detection in recipient BM, consistent with an intestinal mucosal origin, where donor GvH-reactive T cells expanded early upon entry of recipient APCs into the graft. These results, combined with cytotoxic single-cell transcriptional profiles of donor T cells in recipient BM, suggest that tissue-resident GvH-reactive donor T cells migrated into the recipient circulation and BM, where they destroyed recipient hematopoietic cells through cytolytic effector functions and promoted engraftment of graft-derived HSPCs that maintain chimerism. These mechanisms suggest an approach to achieving intestinal allograft tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "We evaluated the role of the thymus in development of multi-organ autoimmunity in human immune system (HIS) mice. T cells were essential for disease development and the same T cell clones with varying phenotypes infiltrated multiple tissues. De novo-generated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived T cells were the major disease drivers, though thymocytes pre-existing in grafted human thymi contributed if not first depleted. HIS mice with a native mouse thymus developed disease earlier than thymectomized mice with a thymocyte-depleted human thymus graft. Defective structure in the native mouse thymus was associated with impaired negative selection of thymocytes expressing a transgenic TCR recognizing a self-antigen. Disease developed without direct recognition of antigens on recipient mouse MHC. While human thymus grafts had normal structure and negative selection, failure to tolerize human T cells recognizing mouse antigens presented on HLA molecules may explain eventual disease development. These new insights have implications for human autoimmunity and suggest methods of avoiding autoimmunity in next-generation HIS mice.",

        "Abstract": "During T cell development in mice, thymic negative selection deletes cells with the potential to recognize and react to self-antigens. In human T cell-dependent autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, T cells reactive to autoantigens are thought to escape negative selection, traffic to the periphery and attack self-tissues. However, physiological thymic negative selection of autoreactive human T cells has not been previously studied. We now describe a human T-cell receptor-transgenic humanized mouse model that permits the study of autoreactive T-cell development in a human thymus. Our studies demonstrate that thymocytes expressing the autoreactive Clone 5 TCR, which recognizes insulin B:9-23 presented by HLA-DQ8, are efficiently negatively selected at the double and single positive stage in human immune systems derived from HLA-DQ8",

        "Abstract": "The success of organ transplantation is limited by the complications of immunosuppression, by chronic rejection, and by the insufficient organ supply, and thousands of patients die every year while waiting for a transplant. With recent progress in xenotransplantation permitting porcine organ graft survival of months or even years in nonhuman primates, there is renewed interest in its potential to alleviate the organ shortage. Many of these advances are the result of our heightened capacity to modify pigs genetically, particularly with the development of CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing methodologies. Although this approach allows the engineering of pig organs that are less prone to rejection, the clinical application of xenotransplantation will require the ability to avoid the ravages of a multifaceted attack on the immune system while preserving the capacity to protect both the recipient and the graft from infectious microorganisms. In this review, we will discuss the potential and limitations of these modifications and how the engineering of the graft can be leveraged to alter the host immune response so that all types of immune attack are avoided.",

The ideal approach would generate donor-specific unresponsiveness to the pig organ without suppressing the patient's normal immune function. Porcine thymus transplantation has shown efficacy in promoting xenotolerance in humanized mice and large animal models. However, murine studies demonstrate that T cells selected in a swine thymus are positively selected only by swine thymic epithelial cells, and therefore, cells expressing human HLA-restricted TCRs may not be selected efficiently in a transplanted pig thymus.

        "Abstract": "We recently developed a high throughput T cell receptor β chain (TCRβ) sequencing-based approach to identifying and tracking donor-reactive T cells. To address the role of clonal deletion in liver allograft tolerance, we applied this method in samples from a recent randomized study, ITN030ST, in which immunosuppression withdrawal was attempted within 2 years of liver transplantation. We identified donor-reactive T cell clones via TCRβ sequencing following a pre-transplant mixed lymphocyte reaction and tracked these clones in the circulation following transplantation in 3 tolerant and 5 non-tolerant subjects. All subjects showed a downward trend and significant reductions in donor-reactive TCRβ sequences were detected post-transplant in 6 of 8 subjects, including 2 tolerant and 4 non-tolerant recipients. Reductions in donor-reactive TCRβ sequences were greater than those of all other TCRβ sequences, including 3rd party-reactive sequences, in all 8 subjects, demonstrating an impact of the liver allograft after accounting for repertoire turnover. Although limited by patient number and heterogeneity, our results suggest that partial deletion of donor-reactive T cell clones may be a consequence of liver transplantation and does not correlate with success or failure of early immunosuppression withdrawal. These observations underscore the organ- and/or protocol-specific nature of tolerance mechanisms in humans.",

        "Abstract": "This review focuses on our recent studies involving nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplantation as an approach to inducing organ allograft tolerance across MHC barriers in nonhuman primates and in patients. The clinical studies are focused on mechanisms of tolerance involved in a protocol carried out at Massachusetts General Hospital in HLA-mismatched haploidentical combinations for the induction of renal allograft tolerance. These studies, in which chimerism was only transient and GVHD did not occur, suggest an early role for donor-specific regulatory T cells in tolerance induction, followed by partial and gradual deletion of donor-reactive T cells. We utilized high-throughput sequencing methodologies in a novel way to identify and track large numbers of alloreactive T cell receptors (TCRs). This method has been shown to identify biologically significant alloreactive TCRs in transplant patients and pointed to clonal deletion as a major mechanism of long-term tolerance in these patients. More recently, we adapted this sequencing method to optimally identify the donor-specific regulatory T cell (Treg) repertoire. Interrogation of the early posttransplant repertoire demonstrated expansion of donor-specific Tregs in association with tolerance. Our studies suggest a role for the kidney graft in tolerance by these mechanisms in patients who had only transient chimerism. Nonhuman primate studies indicate that other organs, including the heart, the lungs and the liver, are less readily tolerated following a period of transient mixed chimerism. Our efforts to extend the reach of mixed chimerism for tolerance induction beyond the kidney are therefore focused on the addition of recipient Tregs to the protocol. This approach has the potential to enhance chimerism while further reducing the risk of GVHD.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated human T-cell repertoire formation using high throughput TCRβ CDR3 sequencing in immunodeficient mice receiving human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and human thymus grafts. Replicate humanized mice generated diverse and highly divergent repertoires. Repertoire narrowing and increased CDR3β sharing was observed during thymocyte selection. While hydrophobicity analysis implicated self-peptides in positive selection of the overall repertoire, positive selection favored shorter shared sequences that had reduced hydrophobicity at positions 6 and 7 of CDR3βs, suggesting weaker interactions with self-peptides than unshared sequences, possibly allowing escape from negative selection. Sharing was similar between autologous and allogeneic thymi and occurred between different cell subsets. Shared sequences were enriched for allo-crossreactive CDR3βs and for Type 1 diabetes-associated autoreactive CDR3βs. Single-cell TCR-sequencing showed increased sharing of CDR3αs compared to CDR3βs between mice. Our data collectively implicate preferential positive selection for shared human CDR3βs that are highly cross-reactive. While previous studies suggested a role for recombination bias in producing \"public\" sequences in mice, our study is the first to demonstrate a role for thymic selection. Our results implicate positive selection for promiscuous TCRβ sequences that likely evade negative selection, due to their low affinity for self-ligands, in the abundance of \"public\" human TCRβ sequences.",

        "Abstract": "Human intestinal transplantation often results in long-term mixed chimerism of donor and recipient blood in transplant patients. We followed the phenotypes of chimeric peripheral blood cells in 21 patients receiving intestinal allografts over 5 years. Donor lymphocyte phenotypes suggested a contribution of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from the graft. Surprisingly, we detected donor-derived HSPCs in intestinal mucosa, Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver. Human gut HSPCs are phenotypically similar to bone marrow HSPCs and have multilineage differentiation potential in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of circulating post-transplant donor T cells suggests that they undergo selection in recipient lymphoid organs to acquire immune tolerance. Our longitudinal study of human HSPCs carried in intestinal allografts demonstrates their turnover kinetics and gradual replacement of donor-derived HSPCs from a circulating pool. Thus, we have demonstrated the existence of functioning HSPCs in human intestines with implications for promoting tolerance in transplant recipients.",

        "Abstract": "Allograft tolerance, in which a graft is accepted without long-term immunosuppression, could overcome numerous obstacles in transplantation. Human allograft tolerance has been intentionally induced across HLA barriers via combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT) with a regimen that induces only transient chimerism. Tregs are enriched early after CKBMT. While deletional tolerance contributes to long-term tolerance, the role of Tregs remains unclear. We have optimized a method for identifying the donor-specific Treg repertoire and used it to interrogate the fate of donor-specific Tregs after CKBMT. We expanded Tregs with several different protocols. Using functional analyses and T cell receptor sequencing, we found that expanding sorted Tregs with activated donor B cells identified the broadest Treg repertoire with the greatest potency and donor specificity of suppression. This method outperformed both alloantigen stimulation with CTLA4Ig and sequencing of CFSElo cells from the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction. In 3 tolerant and 1 nontolerant CKBMT recipients, we sequenced donor-specific Tregs before transplant and tracked them after transplant. Preexisting donor-specific Tregs were expanded at 6 months after CKBMT in tolerant patients and were reduced in the nontolerant patient. These results suggest that early expansion of donor-specific Tregs is involved in tolerance induction following CKBMT.",

        "Abstract": "The last 15 years or so have seen exciting progress in xenotransplantation, with porcine organ grafts surviving months or even years in non-human primates. These advances reflect the application of new scientific knowledge, improved immunosuppressive agents, and genetic engineering. The field has recently enjoyed a renaissance of interest and hope, largely due to the exponential increase in our capacity to genetically engineer porcine source animals. However, immune responses to xenografts are very powerful and widespread clinical application of xenotransplantation will depend on the ability to suppress these immune responses while preserving the capacity to protect both the recipient and the graft from infectious microorganisms. Our work over the last three decades has aimed to engineer the immune system of the recipient in a manner that achieves specific tolerance to the xenogeneic donor while preserving otherwise normal immune function. Important proofs of principle have been obtained, first in rodents, and later in human immune systems in \"humanized mice\" and finally in non-human primates, demonstrating the capacity and potential synergy of mixed xenogeneic chimerism and xenogeneic thymic transplantation in tolerizing multiple arms of the immune system. Considering the fact that clinical tolerance has recently been achieved for allografts and the even greater importance of avoiding excessive immunosuppression for xenografts, it is my belief that it is both possible and imperative that we likewise achieve xenograft tolerance. I expect this to be accomplished through the availability of targeted approaches to recipient immune conditioning, understanding of immunological mechanisms of tolerance, advanced knowledge of physiological incompatibilities, and the availability of inbred miniature swine with optimized use of genetic engineering.",

        "Abstract": "B cells play a major role in antigen presentation and antibody production in the development of autoimmune diseases, and some of these diseases disproportionally occur in females. Moreover, immune responses tend to be stronger in female vs male humans and mice. Because it is challenging to distinguish intrinsic from extrinsic influences on human immune responses, we used a personalized immune (PI) humanized mouse model, in which immune systems were generated de novo from adult human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in immunodeficient mice. We assessed the effect of recipient sex and of donor autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes [T1D] and rheumatoid arthritis [RA]) on human B-cell development in PI mice. We observed that human B-cell levels were increased in female recipients regardless of the source of human HSCs or the strain of immunodeficient recipient mice. Moreover, mice injected with T1D- or RA-derived HSCs displayed B-cell abnormalities compared with healthy control HSC-derived mice, including altered B-cell levels, increased proportions of mature B cells and reduced CD19 expression. Our study revealed an HSC-extrinsic effect of recipient sex on human B-cell reconstitution. Moreover, the PI humanized mouse model revealed HSC-intrinsic defects in central B-cell tolerance that recapitulated those in patients with autoimmune diseases. These results demonstrate the utility of humanized mouse models as a tool to better understand human immune cell development and regulation.",

In patients with permanent mixed chimerism, central deletion may be a major mechanism of long-term tolerance. In patients in whom donor chimerism is only transient, the kidney itself plays a significant role in maintaining long-term tolerance. A high throughput sequencing approach to identifying and tracking a significant portion of the alloreactive T cell receptor repertoire has demonstrated biological significance in transplant patients and has been useful in pointing to clonal deletion as a long-term tolerance mechanism in recipients of HLA-mismatched combined kidney and bone marrow transplants with only transient chimerism.",

        "Abstract": "Immune responses to allografts represent a major barrier in organ transplantation. Immune tolerance to avoid chronic immunosuppression is a critical goal in the field, recently achieved in the clinic by combining bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with kidney transplantation following non-myeloablative conditioning. At high levels of chimerism such protocols can permit central deletional tolerance, but with a significant risk of graft-versus-host (GVH) disease (GVHD). By contrast, transient chimerism-based tolerance is devoid of GVHD risk and appears to initially depend on regulatory T cells (Tregs) followed by gradual, presumably peripheral, clonal deletion of donor-reactive T cells. Here we review recent mechanistic insights into tolerance and the development of more robust and safer protocols for tolerance induction that will be guided by innovative immune monitoring tools.",

        "Abstract": "Alloimmune T cells are central mediators of rejection and graft-versus-host disease in both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Unique among immune responses in terms of its strength and diversity, the T cell alloresponse reflects extensive genetic polymorphisms between allogeneic donors and recipients, most prominently within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which encodes human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) in humans. The repertoire of alloreactive T cell clones is distinct for every donor-recipient pair and includes potentially thousands of unique HLA/peptide specificities. The extraordinary magnitude of the primary alloresponse and diversity of the T cell population mediating it have presented technical challenges to its study in humans. High-throughput T cell receptor sequencing approaches have opened up new possibilities for tackling many fundamental questions about this important immunologic phenomenon.",

        "Abstract": "A paradigm in transplantation states that graft-infiltrating T cells are largely non-alloreactive \"bystander\" cells. However, the origin and specificity of allograft T cells over time has not been investigated in detail in animals or humans. Here, we use polychromatic flow cytometry and high throughput TCR sequencing of serial biopsies to show that gut-resident T cell turnover kinetics in human intestinal allografts are correlated with the balance between intra-graft host-vs-graft (HvG) and graft-vs-host (GvH) reactivities and with clinical outcomes. In the absence of rejection, donor T cells were enriched for GvH-reactive clones that persisted long-term in the graft. Early expansion of GvH clones in the graft correlated with rapid replacement of donor APCs by the recipient. Rejection was associated with transient infiltration by blood-like recipient CD28+ NKG2D",

        "Abstract": "Alloreactive T lymphocytes are the primary mediators of allograft rejection. The size and diversity of the HLA-alloreactive T cell repertoire has thus far precluded the ability to follow these T cells and thereby to understand their fate in human transplant recipients. This review summarizes the history, challenges, and recent advances in the study of alloreactive T cells. We highlight the historical development of assays to measure alloreactivity and discuss how high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing-based assays can provide a new window into the fate of alloreactive T cells in human transplant recipients. A specific approach combining a classical in vitro assay, the mixed lymphocyte reaction, with deep T cell receptor sequencing is described as a tool to track the donor-reactive T cell repertoire for any specific HLA-mismatched donor-recipient pair. This assay can provide mechanistic insights and has potential as a noninvasive, highly specific biomarker for rejection and tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammation in the priming host environment has critical effects on the graft-versus-host (GVH) responses mediated by naive donor T cells. However, it is unclear how a quiescent or inflammatory environment impacts the activity of GVH-reactive primed T and memory cells. We show in this article that GVH-reactive primed donor T cells generated in irradiated recipients had diminished ability compared with naive T cells to increase donor chimerism when transferred to quiescent mixed allogeneic chimeras. GVH-reactive primed T cells showed marked loss of cytotoxic function and activation, and delayed but not decreased proliferation or accumulation in lymphoid tissues when transferred to quiescent mixed chimeras compared with freshly irradiated secondary recipients. Primed CD4 and CD8 T cells provided mutual help to sustain these functions in both subsets. CD8 help for CD4 cells was largely IFN-γ dependent. TLR stimulation after transfer of GVH-reactive primed T cells to mixed chimeras restored their cytotoxic effector function and permitted the generation of more effective T cell memory in association with reduced PD-1 expression on CD4 memory cells. Our data indicate that an inflammatory host environment is required for the maintenance of GVH-reactive primed T cell functions and the generation of memory T cells that can rapidly acquire effector functions. These findings have important implications for graft-versus-host disease and T cell-mediated immunotherapies.",

        "Abstract": "T cell responses to allogeneic major histocompatibility complex antigens present a formidable barrier to organ transplantation, necessitating long-term immunosuppression to minimize rejection. Chronic rejection and drug-induced morbidities are major limitations that could be overcome by allograft tolerance induction. Tolerance was first intentionally induced in humans via combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT), but the mechanisms of tolerance in these patients are incompletely understood. We now establish an assay to identify donor-reactive T cells and test the role of deletion in tolerance after CKBMT. Using high-throughput sequencing of the T cell receptor B chain CDR3 region, we define a fingerprint of the donor-reactive T cell repertoire before transplantation and track those clones after transplant. We observed posttransplant reductions in donor-reactive T cell clones in three tolerant CKBMT patients; such reductions were not observed in a fourth, nontolerant, CKBMT patient or in two conventional kidney transplant recipients on standard immunosuppressive regimens. T cell repertoire turnover due to lymphocyte-depleting conditioning only partially accounted for the observed reductions in tolerant patients; in fact, conventional transplant recipients showed expansion of circulating donor-reactive clones, despite extensive repertoire turnover. Moreover, loss of donor-reactive T cell clones more closely associated with tolerance induction than in vitro functional assays. Our analysis supports clonal deletion as a mechanism of allograft tolerance in CKBMT patients. The results validate the contribution of donor-reactive T cell clones identified before transplant by our method, supporting further exploration as a potential biomarker of transplant outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Transplantation of xenogeneic thymus tissue allows xenograft tolerance induction in the highly disparate pig-to-mouse model. Fetal swine thymus (SW THY) can support the generation of a diverse human T cell repertoire that is tolerant of the pig in vitro. We demonstrate that SW THY generates all human T cell subsets, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), in similar numbers as fetal human thymus (HU THY) grafts in immunodeficient mice receiving the same human CD34(+) cells. Peripheral T cells are specifically tolerant to the mouse and to the human and porcine donors, with robust responses to nondonor human and pig Ags. Specific tolerance is observed to pig skin grafts sharing the THY donor MHC. SW THY-generated peripheral Tregs show similar function, but include lower percentages of naive-type Tregs compared with HU THY-generated Tregs. Tregs contribute to donor-pig specific tolerance. Peripheral human T cells generated in SW THY exhibit reduced proportions of CD8(+) T cells and reduced lymphopenia-driven proliferation and memory-type conversion, accelerated decay of memory-type cells, and reduced responses to protein Ags. Thus, SW thymus transplantation is a powerful xenotolerance approach for human T cells. However, immune function may be further enhanced by strategies to permit positive selection by autologous HLA molecules.",

        "Abstract": "The discrepancy between organ need and organ availability represents one of the major limitations in the field of transplantation. One possible solution to this problem is xenotransplantation. Research in this field has identified several obstacles that have so far prevented the successful development of clinical xenotransplantation protocols. The main immunologic barriers include strong T-cell and B-cell responses to solid organ and cellular xenografts. In addition, components of the innate immune system can mediate xenograft rejection. Here, we review these immunologic and physiologic barriers and describe some of the strategies that we and others have developed to overcome them. We also describe the development of two strategies to induce tolerance across the xenogeneic barrier, namely thymus transplantation and mixed chimerism, from their inception in rodent models through their current progress in preclinical large animal models. We believe that the addition of further beneficial transgenes to Gal knockout swine, combined with new therapies such as Treg administration, will allow for successful clinical application of xenotransplantation.",

This state is usually attained through either bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        "Title": "Clinical strategy for induction of transplantation tolerance through mixed chimerism.",
        "Abstract": "Following the demonstration that transplant tolerance could be induced in non-human primate recipients treated with non-myeloablative conditioning that resulted in only transient chimerism, we began in 1998 to evaluate this approach first in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), secondary to multiple myeloma (MM). A total of 10 patients with ESRD and MM have been treated with this initial protocol. Only 2 recipients developed evidence of reversible renal allograft rejection after stopping immunosuppression. Long-term (up to 14 years) operational renal allograft tolerance has been observed in all 10 patients, even in those with transient hematopoietic chimerism. Control of the MM has been less complete, as recurrent disease developed in five of these patients, three of whom expired. Nevertheless, in view of the essentially 100% 3-5 year mortality typically expected with alternative treatments for this challenging population, it has been suggested that combined kidney and donor bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT) following non-myeloablative conditioning should become the standard therapy for patients with ESRD secondary to MM (27). These encouraging results, as well as the acceptable morbidity observed in cancer patients receiving non-myeloablative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched bone marrow transplantation in our center, led us to next evaluate CKBMT in 10 patients of HLA-mismatched transplants. All 10 subjects developed transient chimerism and in seven of these, immunosuppression was successfully discontinued. Four subjects continue to be immunosuppression free for periods of 4.5-11 years, while in three, reinstitution of immunosuppression was advised or accomplished after 5-8 years due to recurrence of original disease or chronic antibody mediated rejection. Donor-specific antibodies were frequently detectable in the earlier recipients. In contrast, no donor-specific antibodies were detected after immunosuppression was discontinued in the last four subjects, who showed more consistent and durable B-cell depletion. In conclusion, our studies have shown that immunosuppression-free renal allograft survival can be achieved in both HLAmatched and mismatched donor-recipient pairs, with follow up times now of greater than 14 years after induction of transient chimerism through CKBMT.",

        "Abstract": "In mice, graft-versus-host reactions, associated with powerful graft-versus-tumor effects, can be achieved without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by delayed administration of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) to established mixed chimeras. However, GVHD sometimes occurs after DLI in established mixed chimeric patients. In contrast to mice, in which T cell recovery from the thymus occurs prior to DLI administration, human T cell reconstitution following T cell-depleted hematopoietic cell transplantation is slow, resulting in lymphopenia at the time of DLI. We demonstrate in this study that T cell lymphopenia is an independent risk factor for GVHD following DLI in the absence of known inflammatory stimuli. DLI-induced GVHD was prevented in lymphopenic recipients by prior administration of a small number of nonalloreactive polyclonal T cells, insufficient to prevent lymphopenia-associated expansion of subsequently administered T cells, through a regulatory T cell-independent mechanism. GVHD was not inhibited by T cells with irrelevant specificity. Moreover, administration of antibiotics reduced the severity of GVHD in lymphopenic hosts. Accumulation of DLI-derived effector T cells and host hematopoietic cell elimination were markedly diminished by regulatory T cell-depleted, nonalloreactive T cells. Finally, thymectomized mixed chimeras showed increased GVHD following delayed DLI. Collectively, our data demonstrate that in the absence of known conditioning-induced inflammatory stimuli, T cell lymphopenia is a risk factor for GVHD in mixed chimeras receiving delayed DLI. Our data suggest that the predisposition to GVHD can at least in part be explained by the presence of occult inflammatory stimuli due to the absence of T cells to control microbial infections.",

        "Abstract": "Studies of human immune diseases are generally limited to the analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes of heterogeneous patient populations. Improved models are needed to allow analysis of fundamental immunologic abnormalities predisposing to disease and in which to assess immunotherapies. Immunodeficient mice receiving human fetal thymus grafts and fetal CD34(+) cells intravenously produce robust human immune systems, allowing analysis of human T cell development and function. However, to use humanized mice to study human immune-mediated disorders, immune systems must be generated from adult hematopoietic cells. Here, we demonstrated robust immune reconstitution in mice with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) aspirated from bone marrow of adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and healthy control volunteers. In these humanized mice, cryopreservation of human leukocyte antigen allele-matched fetal thymic tissue prevented allogeneic adult HSC rejection. Newly generated T cells, which included regulatory T cells (T(regs)), were functional and self-tolerant and had a diverse repertoire. The immune recognition of these mice mimicked that of the adult CD34(+) cell donor, but the T cell phenotypes were more predominantly \"naïve\" than those of the adult donors. HSCs from T1D and control donors generated similar numbers of natural T(regs) intrathymically; however, peripheral T cells from T1D subjects showed increased proportions of activated or memory cells compared to controls, suggesting possible HSC-intrinsic differences in T cell homeostasis that might underlie immune pathology in T1D. This \"personalized immune\" mouse provides a new model for individualized analysis of human immune responses that may provide new insights into not only T1D but also other forms of immune function and dysfunction as well.",

        "Abstract": "CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) control adaptive immune responses and promote self-tolerance. Various humanized mouse models have been developed in efforts to reproduce and study a human immune system. However, in models that require T cell differentiation in the recipient murine thymus, only low numbers of T cells populate the peripheral immune systems. T cells are positively selected by mouse MHC and therefore do not function well in an HLA-restricted manner. In contrast, cotransplantation of human fetal thymus/liver and i.v. injection of CD34(+) cells from the same donor achieves multilineage human lymphohematopoietic reconstitution, including dendritic cells and formation of secondary lymphoid organs, in NOD/SCID mice. Strong Ag-specific immune responses and homeostatic expansion of human T cells that are dependent on peripheral human APCs occur. We now demonstrate that FOXP3(+)Helios(+) \"natural\" Tregs develop normally in human fetal thymic grafts and are present in peripheral blood, spleen, and lymph nodes of these humanized mice. Humanized mice exhibit normal reversal of CD45 isoform expression in association with thymic egress, postthymic \"naive\" to \"activated\" phenotypic conversion, and suppressive function. These studies demonstrate the utility of this humanized mouse model for the study of human Treg ontogeny, immunobiology and therapy.",

        "Abstract": "The induction of transplantation tolerance could liberate organ transplant recipients from the complications of life-long chronic immunosuppression. The original description of tolerance induction through mixed hematopoietic chimerism in mice utilized lethal whole body irradiation as the preparative regimen for achieving mixed chimerism. While such a regimen might be acceptable for treatment of patients with malignancies, which might also respond to the therapeutic effects of radiation, its toxicity would be unacceptable for patients in need only of an organ transplant. Graft-vs.-host disease, which is frequently a complication of mismatched bone marrow transplantation, would likewise be unacceptable for ordinary clinical transplantation. Therefore, as we have extended the use of this modality for tolerance induction from mice to large animal models, we have attempted to design preparative regimens that avoid both of these complications. In this article, we review our studies of mixed chimerism in mice, miniature swine and monkeys, as well as the results of our recent clinical studies that have extended this treatment modality to a series of kidney transplant patients who have been successfully weaned from all immunosuppression while maintaining stable renal function for up to 8 years.",

        "Abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has most commonly been used to treat hematologic malignancies, where it is often the only potentially curative option available. The success of HCT has been limited by transplant-associated toxicities related to the conditioning regimens used and to the common immunologic consequence of donor T cell recognition of recipient alloantigens, graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). The frequency and severity of GVHD observed when extensive HLA barriers are transgressed has essentially precluded the routine use of extensively HLA-mismatched HCT. Allogeneic HCT also has potential as an approach to organ allograft tolerance induction, but this potential has not been previously realized because of the toxicity associated with traditional conditioning. In this paper we review two approaches to HCT involving reduced intensity conditioning regimens that have been associated with improvements in safety in patients with hematologic malignancies, even in the HLA-mismatched transplant setting. These strategies have been applied in the first successful pilot studies for the induction of organ allograft tolerance in humans. Thus, we summarize an example of vertical translational research between animal models and humans and horizontal translation between two separate goals that culminated in the use of HCT to achieve allograft tolerance in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Administration of a single dose of anti-CD40L mAb at the time of allogeneic BM transplantation tolerizes peripheral alloreactive T cells and permits establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism in mice. Once engrafted, mixed chimeras are systemically tolerant to donor Ags through a central deletion mechanism and will accept any donor organ indefinitely. We previously found that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is required for CD8 T-cell tolerance in this model. However, the cell population that must express PD-1 and the role of other inhibitory molecules were unknown. Here, we report that LAG-3 is required for long-term peripheral CD8 but not CD4 T-cell tolerance and that this requirement is CD8 cell-extrinsic. In contrast, adoptive transfer studies revealed a CD8 T cell-intrinsic requirement for CTLA4/B7.1/B7.2 and for PD-1 for CD8 T-cell tolerance induction. We also observed that both PD-L1 and PD-L2 are independently required on donor cells to achieve T-cell tolerance. Finally, we uncovered a requirement for TGF-β signaling into T cells to achieve peripheral CD8 but not CD4 T-cell tolerance in this in vivo system.",

The availability of recombinant CD40L with high binding capacity for MR1 would provide a valuable immunologic research tool. In this study, we constructed the single chain murine soluble CD40L monomer, dimer, trimer and successfully expressed them in yeast Pichia pastoris under the control of the alcohol oxidase promoter. The secreted single chain murine soluble CD40L monomers, dimers, and trimers were initially enriched through histidine tag capture by Ni-Sepharose 6 fast flow resin and further purified on a cation exchange resin. Purity reached more than 95% for the monomer and dimer forms and more than 90% for the trimer. Protein yield following purification was 16 mg/L for the monomer and dimer, and 8 mg/L for the trimer. ELISA analysis demonstrated that the CD40L dimers and trimers correctly folded in conformations exposing the MR1 antigenic determinant.",

        "Abstract": "Based on clinical observations, we have previously shown in a murine model that recipient leukocyte infusion (RLI) induces a host-versus-graft reaction in mixed bone marrow chimeras and that rejection of donor cells leads to a specific antitumor response against recipient malignancies. This response is dependent on T cells and IFN-gamma. We investigated the role of NKT cells (NKTs) in this phenomenon. Depletion of recipient NK1.1(+) cells led to loss of an anti-tumor effect induced by RLI in mixed bone marrow chimeras. In recipients specifically lacking host invariant NKT cells (iNKTs), RLI did not induce an antitumor effect, indicating a critical role for recipient iNKTs. Conversely, specific activation of iNKTs enhanced the anti-tumor effect induced by RLI. Following RLI, recipient iNKTs, NK cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and CD8 T cells were activated. CD8 T cells were the major producers of IFN-gamma. Lack of recipient iNKTs resulted in failure of activation of NK cells and DCs by RLI. Our studies demonstrate a central role for iNKTs in promoting RLI-induced anti-tumor effects and suggest that this pathway involved promotion of the activation of recipient NK cells and DCs.",

        "Abstract": "Immune recovery in lymphopenic hosts depends largely on homeostatic peripheral expansion, especially when thymopoiesis is insufficient, as is often the case in human adults. Although it has been well studied in mice, the study of homeostatic peripheral expansion of human T cells has been limited by the lack of an appropriate in vivo model. In this study, we use T cell-deficient humanized mice and an adoptive transfer approach to demonstrate that two distinct proliferative responses of autologous T cells occur in vivo in a lymphopenic setting. Human naive CD4 and CD8 T cells that undergo rapid proliferation acquire a memory-like phenotype and the ability to rapidly produce IFN-gamma, whereas those undergoing slow proliferation retain naive phenotypic and functional characteristics. Recovery of both populations depends on the extent of human non-T cell chimerism in the periphery of recipient humanized mice. Furthermore, memory conversion of CD4 and CD8 T cells correlates with the level of human CD14+ and CD19+ chimerism in recipient mice, respectively, suggesting that different types of APCs support memory conversion of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Because lymphopenia affects clinical outcomes, this model, which will allow detailed investigation of the effects of lymphopenia in patients, is of clinical significance.",

Host-type CD8 T cells were shown to be required for these anti-tumor effects in the murine model. Because sustained host CD8 T-cell activation was observed in the murine bone marrow following the disappearance of donor chimerism in the peripheral blood, we hypothesized that donor antigen presentation in the bone marrow might be prolonged.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that blockade of signaling through the T-cell receptor (TCR)/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway impairs transplantation tolerance induced with anti-CD154 antibody. By using an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation model, we examined the role of the TCR/calcineurin/NFAT pathway for tolerance induction with anti-CD154. Calcineurin blockade by cyclosporine A led to a failure of CD8 but not CD4 tolerance, and experiments in NFAT1(-/-) mice replicated this effect. Studies in thymectomized mice demonstrated that blockade of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway after bone marrow transplantation led to a failure of peripheral CD8 tolerance. Moreover, CD8 adoptive transfer studies demonstrated that NFAT1 is cell-intrinsically required for peripheral CD8 tolerance. NFAT1 deficiency did not impair CD8 T-cell up-regulation of PD1, which is required for CD8 tolerance in this model. NFAT1 has previously been shown to have a role in CD4 cells for anergy induction and for programming CD4 cells to become regulatory cells. By generating mice lacking NFAT1 in CD4 but not CD8 cells, we demonstrate that NFAT1 is neither required for CD4 tolerance induction nor for their regulatory function on CD8 T cells. Thus, our study reveals a CD8 T cell-intrinsic NFAT1 requirement for CD8 tolerance in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Although the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 (CD152) has been implicated in peripheral CD4 T-cell tolerance, its mechanism of action remains poorly defined. We analyzed mechanisms of CD4 cell tolerance in a model of tolerance induction involving establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism in recipients of fully MHC-mismatched allogeneic bone marrow cells with anti-CD154 mAb. Animals lacking CD80 and CD86 failed to achieve chimerism. We detected no T cell-intrinsic requirement for CD28 for chimerism induction. However, a CD4 T cell-intrinsic signal through CTLA-4 was shown to be essential within the first 48 hours of exposure to alloantigen for the establishment of tolerance and mixed chimerism. This signal must be provided by a recipient CD80/86(+) non-T-cell population. Donor CD80/86 expression was insufficient to achieve tolerance. Together, our findings demonstrate a surprising role for interactions of CTLA-4 expressed by alloreactive peripheral CD4 T cells with CD80/86 on recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the induction of early tolerance, suggesting a 3-cell tolerance model involving directly alloreactive CD4 cells, donor antigen-expressing bone marrow cells, and recipient antigen-presenting cells. This tolerance is independent of regulatory T cells and culminates in the deletion of directly alloreactive CD4 T cells.",

Given that rodent cells express lower levels of the alphaGal epitope than the more clinically relevant porcine species, the consequences of exposure to cells expressing high levels of alphaGal on the ability to induce B-cell tolerance are unknown.",

        "Abstract": "Because the immunologic differences between species are far greater than those within species, it is likely that the amount of immunosuppression that would be required for successful xenografting would be so much greater than that now used for allografting, that the side-effects and complications would be unacceptable. Tolerance approaches to xenotransplantation would overcome this concern. Studies in humanized mouse models have demonstrated that human T cells can be tolerized to porcine xenografts, providing important proofs of principle of the potential feasibility of pig-to-primate xenograft tolerance. The results available from studies of pig-to-primate xenotransplantation to date have demonstrated that while chronic immunosuppressive drugs have not completely avoided either T cell responses or humoral rejection, approaches directed toward tolerance induction have been encouraging with regard to avoiding immunization at both of these levels.",

        "Title": "Abnormal regulatory and effector T cell function predispose to autoimmunity following xenogeneic thymic transplantation.",
        "Abstract": "Porcine thymus grafts support robust murine and human thymopoiesis, generating a diverse T cell repertoire that is deleted of donor and host-reactive cells, achieving specific xenograft tolerance. Positive selection is mediated exclusively by the xenogeneic thymic MHC. Although thymectomized, T cell-depleted normal mice usually remain healthy following xenogeneic thymic transplantation, thymus-grafted congenitally athymic mice frequently develop multiorgan autoimmunity. We investigated the etiology of this syndrome by adoptively transferring lymphocyte populations from fetal pig thymus-grafted BALB/c nude mice to secondary BALB/c nude recipients. Fetal pig thymus-grafted nude mice generated normal numbers of CD25(+)Foxp3(+)CD4 T cells, but these cells lacked the capacity to block autoimmunity. Moreover, thymocytes and peripheral CD4(+)CD25(-) cells from fetal pig thymus-grafted nude mice, but not those from normal mice, induced autoimmunity in nude recipients. Injection of thymic epithelial cells from normal BALB/c mice into fetal pig thymus grafts reduced autoimmunity and enhanced regulatory function of splenocytes. Our data implicate abnormalities in postthymic maturation, expansion, and/or survival of T cells positively selected by a xenogeneic MHC, as well as incomplete intrathymic deletion of thymocytes recognizing host tissue-specific Ags, in autoimmune pathogenesis. Regulatory cell function is enhanced and negative selection of host-specific thymocytes may potentially also be improved by coimplantation of recipient thymic epithelial cells in the thymus xenograft.",

        "Abstract": "We have examined how the host environment influences the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) response following transfer of donor T cells to allogeneic chimeras. Donor T cells induce significant GVL when administered in large numbers to established mixed chimeras (MC). However, when using limiting numbers of T cells, we found that late transfer to MC induced less GVL than did early transfer to freshly irradiated allogeneic recipients. Late donor T cell transfer to MC was associated with marked accumulation of anti-host CD8 cells within the spleen, but delayed kinetics of differentiation, reduced expression of effector molecules including IFN-gamma, impaired cytotoxicity, and higher rates of sustained apoptosis. Furthermore, in contrast to the spleen, we observed a significant delay in donor CD8 cell recruitment to the bone marrow, a key location for hematopoietic tumors. Increasing the numbers of T cells transferred to MC led to the enhancement of CTL activity and detectable increases in absolute numbers of IFN-gamma(+) cells without inducing graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). TLR-induced systemic inflammation accelerated differentiation of functional CTL in MC but was associated with severe GVHD. In the absence of inflammation, both recipient T and non-T cell populations impeded the full development of GVHD-inducing effector function. We conclude that per-cell deficits in the function of donor CD8 cells activated in MC may be overcome by transferring larger numbers of T cells without inducing GVHD.",

        "Abstract": "Lymphohematopoietic chimerism was first shown to be associated with donor-specific allograft tolerance more than 60 years ago. However, early clinical experience with bone marrow transplantation soon revealed that conventional, myeloablative approaches were far too toxic and the risk of graft-versus-host disease too great to justify using this technology for the purpose of organ allograft tolerance induction in the absence of malignant disease. In this review, we discuss a step-wise approach that has been applied by several centers to establish less toxic approaches to using hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for tolerance induction. These steps include (i) feasibility and efficacy data for tolerance induction in large animal models; (ii) safety data in clinical trials for patients with hematologic malignancies; and (iii) pilot trials of combined HCT and kidney transplantation for tolerance induction. Thus far, only one published trial conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston has achieved long-term acceptance of human leukocyte antigen-mismatched kidney allografts without chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Alternative protocols have been successful in large animals, but long-term organ allograft tolerance has not been reported in patients. Thus, proof-of-principle that nonmyeloablative induction of mixed chimerism can be used intentionally to induce organ allograft tolerance has now been achieved. Directions for further research to make this approach applicable for a broader patient population are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Mixed chimerism and donor-specific tolerance are achieved in mice receiving 3 Gy of total body irradiation and anti-CD154 mAb followed by allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation. In this model, recipient CD4 cells are critically important for CD8 tolerance. To evaluate the role of CD4 cells recognizing donor MHC class II directly, we used class II-deficient donor marrow and were not able to achieve chimerism unless recipient CD8 cells were depleted, indicating that directly alloreactive CD4 cells were necessary for CD8 tolerance. To identify the MHC class II(+) donor cells promoting this tolerance, we used donor BM lacking certain cell populations or used positively selected cell populations. Neither donor CD11c(+) dendritic cells, B cells, T cells, nor donor-derived IL-10 were critical for chimerism induction. Purified donor B cells induced early chimerism and donor-specific cell-mediated lympholysis tolerance in both strain combinations tested. In contrast, positively selected CD11b(+) monocytes/myeloid cells did not induce early chimerism in either strain combination. Donor cell preparations containing B cells were able to induce early deletion of donor-reactive TCR-transgenic 2C CD8 T cells, whereas those devoid of B cells had reduced activity. Thus, induction of stable mixed chimerism depends on the expression of MHC class II on the donor marrow, but no requisite donor cell lineage was identified. Donor BM-derived B cells induced early chimerism, donor-specific cell-mediated lympholysis tolerance, and deletion of donor-reactive CD8 T cells, whereas CD11b(+) cells did not. Thus, BM-derived B cells are potent tolerogenic APCs for alloreactive CD8 cells.",

We have previously demonstrated that phenotypically normal, specifically tolerant human T cells are generated in porcine thymic grafts. In this study, we assessed the diversity of the human T cell repertoire generated in porcine thymic xenografts. We also examined the ability of porcine thymus grafts to coexist with human thymus grafts.",

        "Abstract": "Stem cells (SCs) with varying potentiality have the capacity to repair injured tissues. While promising animal data have been obtained, allogeneic SCs and their progeny are subject to immune-mediated rejection. Here, we review the potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to promote immune tolerance to allogeneic and xenogeneic organs and tissues, to reverse autoimmunity, and to be used optimally to cure hematologic malignancies. We also review the mechanisms by which hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can promote anti-tumor responses and establish donor-specific transplantation tolerance. We discuss the barriers to clinical translation of animal studies and describe some recent studies indicating how they can be overcome. The recent achievements of durable mixed chimerism across human leukocyte antigen barriers without graft-versus-host disease and of organ allograft tolerance through combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation suggest that the potential of this approach for use in the treatment of many human diseases may ultimately be realized.",

        "Abstract": "Although interaction between programmed death-1 (PD-1) and the ligand PD-L1 has been shown to mediate CD8 cell exhaustion in the setting of chronic infection or the absence of CD4 help, a role for this pathway in attenuating early alloreactive CD8 cell responses has not been identified. We demonstrate that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is needed to rapidly tolerize alloreactive CD8 cells in a model that requires CD4 cells and culminates in CD8 cell deletion. This protocol involves allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) following conditioning with low-dose total body irradiation and anti-CD154 antibody. Tolerized donor-reactive T-cell receptor transgenic CD8 cells are shown to be in an abortive activation state prior to their deletion, showing early and prolonged expression of activation markers (compared with rejecting CD8 cells) while being functionally silenced by day 4 after transplantation. Although both tolerized and rejecting alloreactive CD8 cells up-regulate PD-1, CD8 cell tolerance is dependent on the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. In contrast, CD4 cells are tolerized independently of this pathway following BMT with anti-CD154. These studies demonstrate a dichotomy between the requirements for CD4 and CD8 tolerance and identify a role for PD-1 in the rapid tolerization of an alloreactive T-cell population via a deletional mechanism.",

Achievement of chimerism requires avoidance of marrow rejection by pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T cells, either of which can reject fully MHC-mismatched marrow. Both barriers are overcome with a minimal regimen involving anti-CD154 and low dose (3 Gy) total body irradiation, allowing achievement of mixed chimerism and tolerance in mice. CD4 cells are required to prevent marrow rejection by CD8 cells via a novel pathway, wherein recipient CD4 cells interacting with recipient class II MHC tolerize directly alloreactive CD8 cells. We demonstrate a critical role for recipient MHC class II, B cells, and dendritic cells in a pathway culminating in deletional tolerance of peripheral alloreactive CD8 cells.",

        "Abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a frequent and severe complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). One approach to reducing alloreactivity is to deplete the graft of alloreactive T cells. Global T cell depletion results in poor immune reconstitution with high mortality from viral infections and disease relapse. Therefore, an approach to selectively deplete alloreactive T cells without compromising other responses would be highly beneficial. We undertook studies to identify an inducible activation marker expressed on alloreactive effector T cells following culture with HLA-mismatched allostimulators. Compared to other markers, CD134 was superior because of its negative baseline expression and rapid upregulation after activation. Depletion of CD134(+) cells from responder populations dramatically reduced specific alloreactivity as determined by reduction of helper T cell precursor frequencies below the threshold predicting development of clinical GVHD while retaining responses to third-party alloantigens. CD134-allodepleted populations retained effectors specific for the Wilms' tumor (WT1) leukemia antigen as determined by WT1 specific pentamers, and CMV-specific effectors as determined by CMV-specific pentamers and CMV-specific ELISpot. Thus, use of CD134-allodepleted grafts may improve allogeneic SCT by reducing GVHD without loss of pathogen-specific and leukemia-specific immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Xenotransplantation holds great promise for the treatment of end-stage organ failure and tissue injury. Recent advances in our understanding of the immunological hurdles to xenotransplantation and the development of genetic modification approaches to overcome them increase the likelihood of success. Exciting advances in these areas were presented at the Joint Congress of the IXA, the Cell Transplant Society and the International Pancreas and Islet Transplant Association in Minneapolis in September, 2007. However, in order to minimize infectious risks and encourage positive public perception of xenotransplantation, clinical trials should be initiated with appropriate monitoring and oversight procedures in place and only when there is high expectation of clinical benefit.",

        "Abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection depletes thymocytes and destroys thymic structure. Functional, tolerant human T cells develop in vivo in immunodeficient mice receiving porcine thymus and human fetal liver fragments under the kidney capsule. In this model, we evaluated the potential of porcine thymus to protect human thymocytes from the effects of HIV-1. Compared with that observed in control mice with human thymic grafts, porcine thymus attenuated human thymocyte depletion by the CCR5-tropic isolate JR-CSF without preventing thymocyte infection. Porcine thymus protected human thymocytes from infection and depletion by a CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolate without reducing peripheral blood viral loads or T cell infection. Human thymocytes from human but not porcine grafts showed decreased Bcl-2 expression and increased apoptosis after NL4.3 infection. Thus, porcine thymus protects human thymocytes from the cytopathic effect of HIV-1, suggesting a possible approach to achieving immune restoration in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who have incomplete responses to antiretroviral therapy. The model allows analysis of the mechanisms of HIV-mediated thymic dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "After allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplantation, donor T cells interact with a distorted antigen-presenting cell (APC) environment in which some, but not all, host APCs are replaced by APCs from the donor. Significantly, host APCs are required for the priming of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Donor APCs play a lesser role in the induction of acute GVHD despite their predicted capacity to cross-present host antigens. In contrast, donor APCs may play a role in perpetuating the tissue injury observed in chronic GVHD. Host APCs are also required for maximal graft-versus-leukemia responses. Recent studies have suggested potential strategies by which the continued presence of host APCs can be exploited to prime strong donor immunity to tumors without the induction of GVHD.",

        "Abstract": "B-1b cells produce IgM natural antibodies against alpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc (alphaGal). These can be tolerized by nonmyeloablative induction of mixed chimerism using alphaGal-positive (alphaGal+) donor marrow. We assessed the role of CR1/2 in this model for induction of tolerance of B-1b cells. Mixed hematopoietic chimerism was induced in alpha1-3galactosyltransferase (GalT-/-) and GalT-/-Cr2-/- mice with alphaGal+ BALB/c marrow donors. Anti-alphaGal Ab and anti-alphaGal Ab-producing B cells became undetectable in GalT-/- chimeras, whereas they persisted in chimeric GalT-/-Cr2-/- mice. To determine whether CR1/2 expression on stromal cells and/or hematopoietic cells was critical for B-1-cell tolerance, we generated GalT-/- radiation chimeras in which CR1/CR2 was expressed on either stromal cells, hematopoietic cells, neither, or both. After induction of mixed chimerism from alphaGal+ allogeneic bone marrow (BM) donors, anti-alphaGal-producing B cells were rendered tolerant in reconstituted recipients expressing only stromal CR1/CR2. Our results suggest a possible role for follicular dendritic cells that pick up immune complexes via CR1/CR2 receptors in the tolerization of B-1b cells.",

Surprisingly, some patients who reject donor grafts following nonmyeloablative HCT have sustained remissions of advanced, chemorefractory hematologic malignancies. In murine mixed chimeras prepared with nonmyeloablative conditioning, we previously showed that recipient leukocyte infusions (RLIs) induce loss of donor chimerism and mediate antitumor responses against host-type tumors.

        "Abstract": "Transfer of T cells to freshly irradiated allogeneic recipients leads to their rapid recruitment to nonlymphoid tissues, where they induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In contrast, when donor T cells are transferred to established mixed chimeras (MCs), GVHD is not induced despite a robust graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction that eliminates normal and malignant host hematopoietic cells. We demonstrate here that donor GVH-reactive T cells transferred to MCs or freshly irradiated mice undergo similar expansion and activation, with similar up-regulation of homing molecules required for entry to nonlymphoid tissues. Using dynamic two-photon in vivo microscopy, we show that these activated T cells do not enter GVHD target tissues in established MCs, contrary to the dogma that activated T cells inevitably traffic to nonlymphoid tissues. Instead, we show that the presence of inflammation within a nonlymphoid tissue is a prerequisite for the trafficking of activated T cells to that site. Our studies help to explain the paradox whereby GVH-reactive T cells can mediate graft-versus-leukemia responses without inducing GVHD in established MCs.",

        "Abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that xenogeneic bone marrow engraftment and donor-specific tolerance can be induced in mice receiving anti-CD4, -CD8, -Thy-1.2, and -NK1.1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on Days -6 and -1, 3 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), and 7 Gy thymic irradiation on Day 0, followed by injection of T-cell depleted (TCD) rat bone marrow cells. We have recently demonstrated that anti-CD40L mAb treatment is sufficient to completely overcome CD4 cell-mediated resistance to allogeneic marrow engraftment and rapidly induce CD4 cell tolerance in an allogeneic combination.",

        "Abstract": "Following bone marrow transplantation, delayed donor leukocyte infusions (DLIs) can induce graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). These antitumor responses are maximized by the presence of host hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) at the time of DLI. Using a tumor-protection model, we demonstrate here that GVL activity following administration of DLIs to established mixed chimeras is dependent primarily on reactivity to allogeneic MHC antigens rather than minor histocompatibility or tumor-associated antigens. CD8(+) T-cell-dependent GVL responses against an MHC class II-negative tumor following delayed DLI require CD4(+) T-cell help and are reduced significantly when host APCs lack MHC class II expression. CD4(+) T cells primed by host APCs were required for maximal expansion of graft-versus-host reactive CD8(+) T cells but not their synthesis of IFN-gamma. In contrast, the GVL requirement for CD4(+) T-cell help was bypassed almost completely when DLI was administered to freshly irradiated recipients, indicating that the host environment is a major factor influencing the cellular mechanisms of GVL.",

        "Title": "Expression of chemokines in GVHD target organs is influenced by conditioning and genetic factors and amplified by GVHR.",
        "Abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the most significant clinical problem that arises after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Because chemokines induced by proinflammatory conditioning treatment may promote T-cell migration into GVHD target tissues, we addressed the influence of conditioning on chemokine expression in GVHD target organs. Our results showed that (1) conditioning leads to rapid and transient chemokine upregulation in GVHD target tissues before the time of GVHD-associated T-cell infiltration; (2) conditioning intensity and mouse strain influence chemokine expression in GVHD target organs; and (3) compared with syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation led to marked amplification of chemokine expression in GVHD target organs after myeloablative conditioning. This is also reflected by chemokine protein expression that is measured in the serum and colon. Intestines showed the greatest sensitivity to conditioning intensity, and chemokines affecting T-helper type 1 cells (eg, interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 [CXCL10]) were most strongly expressed there after conditioning and during GVHD. However, severity of GVHD was not significantly different between recipients of CXCR3+/+ or CXCR3-/- splenocytes, indicating that this chemokine pathway does not play a critical role. In summary, our data show that conditioning and recipient strain influence chemokine expression in GVHD target organs and that GVH alloreactivity markedly amplifies this expression, thus contributing to the inflammatory cascade associated with tissue GVHD.",

        "Abstract": "In mixed chimeras prepared with nonmyeloablative conditioning, we previously showed that recipient leukocyte infusions (RLI) induced loss of donor chimerism and anti-tumor responses against the A20 BALB/c B cell lymphoma. We also previously showed that RLI-mediated tumor rejection involved IFN-gamma-producing RLI-derived CD8+ cells and non-RLI, recipient-derived CD4 T cells, leading to the generation of anti-tumor cytotoxic cells. However, the mechanisms of such paradoxical anti-tumor responses remained to be clarified. In the present study, we further explored the cellular mechanisms of the anti-tumor effects of RLI in fully MHC-mismatched and haploidentical strain combinations. In both cases, we show that RLI breaks the tolerance of chimeric T cells toward donor antigens, in association with the in vivo expansion of recipient splenic T, B and CD4-CD8- cells and the production of IFN-gamma. RLI leads to the development of two types of tumor-specific responses. The first is mediated by indirect presentation of donor antigens and occurs independently of tumor injection. The second is observed only in recipients of RLI and tumor and may involve responses to self antigens. Anti-tumor cytotoxicity was mediated by CD8+ or CD4-CD8- effector cells. Thus, anti-tumor cytotoxic responses are generated following complex interactions between recipient APCs presenting donor and recipient antigens and host-type CD4+, CD8+ and CD4-CD8- cells.",

        "Abstract": "Recognition of E- and P-selectins on vascular endothelium by their leukocyte glycoprotein counterreceptor P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) initiates and sustains leukocyte rolling, culminating in extravasation of lymphocytes from blood into organs. PSGL-1 is rendered functional by terminal glycosylation steps, which occur mainly in activated Th1 but not Th2 cells. alpha(1,3)Fucosyltransferases IV and VII control this glycosylation pathway. Mice lacking these transferases (Fuc-TIV(-/-)/Fuc-TVII(-/-)) lack functional E- and P-selectin ligands. We hypothesized that Fuc-TIV(-/-)/Fuc-TVII(-/-) donor T cells might have reduced capacity to roll on vessels of inflamed target tissues and mediate graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).",

        "Abstract": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) acts in synergy with other inflammatory stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to induce the maturation of migratory-type monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). However, PGE2 has been reported to inhibit IL-12p70 production by MoDCs and to promote the generation of Th2 T cell responses. We demonstrate here that the addition of PGE2 to TNF for the maturation of MoDCs enhanced CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferative responses to neoantigen and recall antigen, and enhanced Th1-type responses. The increased stimulatory capacity of MoDCs matured with PGE2 was associated with a fully mature, migratory-type MoDC phenotype and more rapid down-regulation of the expression of inflammatory chemokines, with up-regulated expression of the constitutive chemokines TARC and MDC. In addition, although MoDCs matured with TNF and PGE2 selectively produced the inhibitory IL-12p40 subunit at steady state, they were able to produce the bioactive IL-12p70 heterodimer after stimulation with CD40 ligand and/or IFN-gamma. Despite increased IL-6 mRNA expression, MoDCs matured with PGE2 did not overcome the suppressive effects of CD4+ CD25+ T cells in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions. In conclusion, MoDCs matured in the presence of PGE2 display characteristics of more efficient antigen-presenting cells that might be optimal for use in cancer vaccine-based clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "While acquisition of regulatory function by CD4+CD25- T cells has been reported following antigenic stimulation, \"naturally occurring\" regulatory CD4+ T cells (Treg) are believed to express CD25. We examined the mechanisms involved in peripheral CD8 T cell tolerance by induction of mixed chimerism using non-myeloablative conditioning with low-dose (3 Gy) total body irradiation and anti-CD154 antibody. Recipient CD4+ T cells were initially required for the induction of CD8 cell tolerance, but were not needed beyond 2 weeks. Depletion of CD25+ Treg prior to bone marrow transplantation and blockade of IL-2 with neutralizing antibody did not impede tolerance induction. Tolerance was dependent on CTLA4, but not on IFN-gamma. In C57BL/6 mice containing a fraction of 2C TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells, which recognize the MHC class I alloantigen Ld, induction of chimerism with L(d+), but not Ld-, bone marrow cells led to deletion of peripheral 2C+ CD8+ cells within 1 week in peripheral blood and spleen. Complete deletion required the presence of recipient CD4+ T cells. Thus, a novel, rapid form of regulation by CD4+CD25- T cells permits initial CD8 T cell tolerance in this model. Rapid peripheral deletion of donor-specific CD8 T cells precludes an ongoing requirement for CD4 T cell-mediated regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Surprisingly, antitumor responses can occur in patients who reject donor grafts following nonmyeloablative hemopoietic cell transplantation. In murine mixed chimeras prepared with nonmyeloablative conditioning, we previously showed that recipient leukocyte infusions (RLI) induced loss of donor chimerism, IFN-gamma production, and antitumor responses against host-type tumors. However, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain to be determined. We now demonstrate that the effects of RLI are mediated by distinct and complex mechanisms. Donor marrow rejection is induced by RLI-derived alloactivated T cells, which activate non-RLI-derived, recipient IFN-gamma-producing cells. RLI-derived CD8 T cells induce the production of IFN-gamma by both RLI and non-RLI-derived recipient cells. The antitumor responses of RLI involve mainly RLI-derived IFN-gamma-producing CD8 T cells and recipient-derived CD4 T cells and do not involve donor T cells. The pathways of donor marrow and tumor rejection lead to the development of tumor-specific cell-mediated cytotoxic responses that are not due to bystander killing by alloreactive T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Since the introduction of organ transplantation into medical practice, progress and optimism have been abundant. Improvements in immunosuppressive drugs and ancillary care have led to outstanding short-term (1--3-year) patient and graft survival rates. This success is mitigated by several problems, including poor long-term (>5-year) graft survival rates, the need for continual immunosuppressive medication and the discrepancy between the demand for organs and the supply. Developing methods to induce transplant tolerance, as a means to improve graft outcomes and eliminate the requirement for immunosuppression, and expanding the pool of organs for transplantation are the major challenges of the field.",

It may now be applicable for the treatment of severe autoimmune diseases, such as therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Studies in animal models show that the transfer of haematopoietic stem cells can reverse autoimmunity, and several mechanistic pathways may explain this phenomenon. The outcome of ongoing clinical trials, as well as of studies in patients and animal models, will help to determine the role that stem-cell transplantation can play in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",

We have utilized alpha1-3Gal transferase (GalT) knockout mice, which, like humans, produce anti-Gal natural antibodies, to investigate the ability of mixed chimerism to tolerize B cells producing antibodies of this important specificity, which limits xenotransplantation by causing hyperacute and delayed xenograft rejection. Mixed allogeneic or xenogeneic chimerism indeed tolerizes both preexisting anti-Gal-producing B cells and those developing de novo after establishment of mixed chimerism, even in presensitized mice. We present evidence that different mechanisms are involved in the tolerization of the preexisting and newly-developing antibody-secreting cells.",

These GVH responses are confined to the lymphohematopoietic system and mediate graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) reactions without causing GVHD. Although interaction of donor T-cells with host-derived antigen-presenting cells (APC) is central to the development of GVHD, we were able to show that this T-cell/APC interaction is also critical for the induction of GVL, which can occur in the absence of GVHD if donor T-cell administration is delayed to a time point after bone-marrow transplant (BMT) when conditioning-induced inflammation has subsided. Induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism using the method described below allows analysis of these interactions between host APC and donor T-cells.",

        "Title": "Tolerance induction in clinical transplantation.",
        "Abstract": "Introduction of modern immunosuppressive agents has led to great success of allotransplantation in humans, and survival rates for all solid organs have been dramatically improved. However, a constant proportion of organs is lost every year due to chronic allograft rejection and immunosuppressive drug toxicity. This has led to a situation where, despite the of donor organ shortage, about one third of the patients on the kidney transplant waiting list are listed for a retransplant. The induction of donor-specific tolerance has the potential of at least partially resolving this problem, since it might prevent chronic rejection and drug toxicity at the same time. For a variety of protocols, successful tolerance induction has been demonstrated in rodent models. However, translation of such protocols to large animal models and on clinical trials has turned out to be very difficult. This review briefly describes mechanisms and barriers to transplantation tolerance, and then focuses on pre-clinical and clinical studies in non-human primates and humans. We have divided the strategies into two groups, based on the principle mechanisms of tolerance induction: the first group are protocols not using hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) as part of there regimen. They rely mainly on intensive T cell depletion (either by total body irradiation, total lymphoid irradiation or treatment with T cell-depleting agents such as anti-thymocyte globulin, anti-CD52 antibody or CD3 immunotoxin), which have been combined with costimulatory blockade, signaling blockade or donor antigen infusion. The second group are HCT-based protocols combining HCT with T cell-depleting agents and cytoreductive treatment. So far, only two protocols (one with total lymphoid irradiation and anti-thymocyte globulin, but no HCT; one with HCT, cyclophosphamide, anti-thymocyte globulin and thymic irradiation) have been translated into successful human studies. We summarize and discuss the results of these trials and suggest goals for further studies for the development tolerance protocols applicable for a broad population of allograft recipients.",

        "Abstract": "The establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism induces life-long donor-specific organ graft tolerance while obviating the need for chronic immunosuppression. Recent advances have dramatically reduced the conditioning toxicity required to achieve mixed chimerism. We argue that the achievement of high levels of donor chimerism ensures life-long deletion of donor-reactive T cells, precluding and obviating the need for regulatory mechanisms in the maintenance of tolerance. However, in situations where high levels of donor chimerism cannot be established or sustained, control of immune responsiveness can be achieved through additional mechanisms, including regulatory T cells.",

        "Abstract": "The development of malignant disease might be seen as a failure of immune surveillance. However, not all tumors are naturally immunogenic, and even among those that are immunogenic, the uncontrolled rapid growth of a tumor may sometimes out-run a robust immune response. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that mechanisms of tolerance that normally exist to prevent autoimmune disease may also preclude the development of an adequate antitumor response and that tumors themselves have the ability to thwart the development of effective immune responses against their antigens. A major challenge has been to develop approaches to breaking this tolerance in tumor-bearing hosts, and recent advances in our understanding of antigen presentation and tolerance have led to some promising strategies. An alternative approach is to use T cells from nontumor-bearing, allogeneic hosts in the form of lymphocyte infusions, with or without hematopoietic cell transplantation. Immunotherapy may occur in this setting via the response of nontolerant, tumor antigen-specific T cells from nontumor-bearing hosts or via the powerful destructive effect of an alloresponse directed against antigens shared by malignant cells in the recipient. Approaches to exploiting this beneficial effect without the deleterious consequence of graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic hematopoietic cell recipients are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Anti-CD154 (CD40L) monoclonal antibody (mAb) plus bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in mice receiving CD8 cell-depleting mAb leads to long-term mixed hematopoietic chimerism and systemic donor-specific tolerance through peripheral and central deletional mechanisms. However, CD4(+) T-cell tolerance is demonstrable in vitro and in vivo rapidly following BMT, before deletion of donor-reactive CD4 cells is complete, suggesting the involvement of other mechanisms. We examined these mechanisms in more detail. Spot enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISPOT) analysis revealed specific tolerization (within 4 to 15 days) of both T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokine responses to the donor, with no evidence for cytokine deviation. Tolerant lymphocytes did not significantly down-regulate rejection by naive donor-reactive T cells in adoptive transfer experiments. No evidence for linked suppression was obtained when skin expressing donor alloantigens in association with third-party alloantigens was grafted. T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mixing studies revealed that specific peripheral deletion of alloreactive CD4 T cells occurs over the first 4 weeks following BMT with anti-CD154. In contrast to models involving anti-CD154 without BMT, BMT with anti-CD154 leads to the rapid induction of anergy, followed by deletion of pre-existing donor-reactive peripheral CD4(+) T cells; the rapid deletion of these cells obviates the need for a regulatory cell population to suppress CD4 cell-mediated alloreactivity.",

        "Abstract": "Bone marrow transplantation from diabetes-resistant strains with complete replacement of the recipient immune system by the allogeneic donor has led to tolerance to donor islets and cure of diabetes in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. However, the ability to tolerize host T-cells of diabetic NOD mice is unknown. We demonstrate that nonmyeloablative conditioning achieves mixed hematopoietic chimerism across major histocompatibility complex (MHC) barriers in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. This conditioning preserves alloreactive and autoreactive diabetogenic host NOD T-cells, but when mixed chimerism was established, diabetic NOD mice accepted donor-type allogeneic islet grafts and were cured of diabetes, despite a significant recipient T-cell contribution. Furthermore, induction of mixed chimerism permitted acceptance of NOD islet grafts, demonstrating reversal of autoimmunity. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was critical for tolerization of diabetogenic and alloreactive host T-cells. Thus, mixed hematopoietic chimerism induces tolerance to donor islets and reverses established autoimmunity in diabetic NOD mice.",

        "Abstract": "Treatment with a single injection of anti-CD40L (CD154) monoclonal antibody (mAb) and fully mismatched allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) allows rapid tolerization of CD4+ T cells to the donor. The addition of in vivo CD8 T-cell depletion leads to permanent mixed hematopoietic chimerism and tolerance. We now describe two approaches that obviate the requirement for CD8 T-cell depletion by rapidly tolerizing recipient CD8 T cells in addition to CD4 cells. Administration of donor-specific transfusion (DST) to mice receiving 3 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), BMT and anti-CD40L mAb on day 0 uniformly led to permanent mixed chimerism and tolerance, compared with only 40% of mice receiving similar treatment without DST. In the absence of DST, moving the timing of 3 Gy TBI to day -1 or day -2 instead of day 0 led to rapid (by 2 weeks) induction of CD8+ cell tolerance, and also permitted uniform achievement of permanent mixed chimerism and donor-specific tolerance in recipients of anti-CD40L and BMT on day 0. These nontoxic regimens overcome CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell-mediated alloresistance without requiring host T-cell depletion, permitting the induction of permanent mixed chimerism and tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "Peritoneal cavity B-1 cells are believed to produce IgM natural Abs. We have used alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase-deficient (GalT(-/-)) mice, which, like humans, produce IgM natural Abs against the carbohydrate epitope Galalpha1,3Gal (Gal), to demonstrate that peritoneal cavity B-1b cells with anti-Gal receptors produce anti-Gal IgM Abs only after LPS stimulation. Likewise, peritoneal cavity cells of GalT(-/-) and wild-type mice do not produce IgM Abs of other specificities without LPS stimulation. Development of Ab-secreting capacity is associated with loss of CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) expression. In contrast, there are large numbers of cells producing anti-Gal and other IgM Abs in fresh splenocyte preparations from GalT(-/-) and (for non-Gal specificities) wild-type mice. These cells are Mac-1(-) but otherwise B-1b-like in their phenotype. We therefore hypothesized a pathway wherein peritoneal cavity B cells migrate into the spleen after activation in vivo and lose Mac-1 expression to become IgM Ab-producing cells. Consistent with this possibility, splenectomy reduced anti-Gal Ab production after immunization of GalT(-/-) mice with Gal-positive rabbit RBC. Furthermore, splenectomized B6 GalT(-/-), Ig micro -chain mutant ( micro (-/-)) (both Gal- and B cell-deficient) mice produced less anti-Gal IgM than nonsplenectomized controls after adoptive transfer of peritoneal cavity cells from B6 GalT(-/-) mice. When sorted GalT(-/-) Mac-1(+) peritoneal cavity B cells were adoptively transferred to B6 GalT(-/-), micro (-/-) mice, IgM Abs including anti-Gal appeared, and IgM-producing and Mac1(-) B cells were present in the spleen 5 wk after transfer. These findings demonstrate that peritoneal cavity Mac-1(+) B-1 cells are precursors of Mac-1(-) splenic IgM Ab-secreting cells.",

        "Abstract": "Long-term multilineage chimerism is achieved in CD45 congenic mice receiving high bone marrow doses with or without mediastinal irradiation (MI). Increased donor chimerism results in MI-treated compared with nonirradiated animals, suggesting that MI makes \"space\" for engraftment of donor pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (PHSCs). We have now examined whether space is systemic or whether increased engraftment of donor marrow in locally irradiated mice is confined to the irradiated bones. While increased donor chimerism was observed in irradiated bones compared with nonirradiated bones of MI-treated animals 4 weeks following bone marrow transplantation (BMT), these differences were minimal by 40 weeks. MI-treated chimeras contained more adoptively transferable donor PHSCs in the marrow of both irradiated and distant bones compared with non-MI-treated chimeras. Similar proportions of donor PHSCs were present in irradiated and nonirradiated bones of locally irradiated mice at both 4 and 40 weeks. Irradiated bones contained more donor short-term repopulating cells than distant bones at 4 weeks, but not 40 weeks, after BMT. Our study suggests that local proliferation of donor PHSCs in mice receiving local irradiation rapidly leads to a systemic increase in donor PHSC engraftment.",

        "Abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells kill allogeneic cells that lack a class I MHC ligand for clonally distributed killer inhibitory receptors (KIR). Following HLA-mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), donor NK cells might mediate graft-vs-host (GVH) reactions that promote donor chimerism and mediate anti-tumor effects. Additionally, recipient NK cells might mediate donor marrow rejection. We have developed a nonmyeloablative approach to haploidentical HCT involving recipient treatment with a T cell-depleting mAb, Medi-507, that can achieve donor engraftment and mixed hematopoietic chimerism without graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are later administered in an effort to achieve graft-vs-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effects without GVHD. It is unknown whether NK cell \"tolerance\" develops in human mixed chimeras.",

        "Abstract": "Murine mixed hematopoietic chimerism can be achieved following nonmyeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide, T cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies, and thymic irradiation. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) 35 days after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) convert mixed to full donor chimerism and mediate graft-versus-lymphoma effects without graft-versus-host disease. We evaluated the role of T-cell subsets in DLIs in converting mixed to full donor chimerism in a fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched strain combination. Whereas DLIs administered on day 35 converted 100% of mixed chimeras to full donor chimerism, conversion was less frequent when either CD4 or CD8 cells were depleted, indicating that both subsets contribute to the conversion. Surprisingly, administration of CD8-depleted DLIs led to complete loss of donor chimerism in a high proportion (54%) of recipients compared with CD4-plus CD8-depleted DLIs (15%) or CD4-depleted DLIs (0%) (P <.05). DLIs administered at early time points after BMT (eg, day 21) also precipitated rejection of donor marrow by recipient alphabeta T cells, in association with donor CD4 cell expansion and high production of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, and interferon-gamma. Thus, DLIs can paradoxically induce marrow rejection by residual host alphabeta T cells. These results have implications for the timing of and use of subset depletion of DLIs in recipients of nonmyeloablative transplants.",

        "Abstract": "Anti-CD40L mAb plus bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and recipient CD8 T-cell depletion permits long-term mixed hematopoietic chimerism and systemic donor-specific tolerance to be achieved across full MHC barriers. Initial tolerance is characterized by peripheral deletion of donor-reactive CD4 cells. In regimens using costimulatory blockade without BMT to achieve allograft survival, cyclosporine inhibited graft survival, suggesting that the combination may not be clinically applicable. We assessed the role of cyclosporine-sensitive mechanisms and the mechanisms of T-cell apoptosis involved in the induction of early peripheral CD4+ T-cell tolerance by BMT with anti-CD40L. Neither a short course of cyclosporine (14 days) nor the absence of FAS-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) blocked the induction or maintenance of donor-specific tolerance. IL-2 production was not associated with tolerance induction, consistent with the lack of a role for Fas-mediated AICD. Mice in which passive T-cell death was impaired because of constitutive expression of a Bcl-xL transgene did not develop tolerance with this protocol. These data confirm that deletion of donor-reactive T cells is critical for the induction of mixed chimerism and tolerance. However, the mechanisms involved may differ from those involved in costimulatory blockade regimens that do not include BMT.",

        "Abstract": "Some patients lose chimerism following nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), yet, surprisingly, enjoy sustained tumor remissions. We hypothesized that host-versus-graft (HVG) alloresponses might induce antitumor effects against recipient tumors. We explored this question in mice by administering recipient leukocyte infusions (RLIs) to mixed chimeras established with nonmyeloablative conditioning. Mixed chimeras were prepared in the B10.A (H2a)-->B6 (H2b) strain combination using depleting anti-T-cell monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), cyclophosphamide, and thymic irradiation. B6 myeloid leukemia cells (MMB3.19) were administered 7 days following donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or RLI on day 35. Conversion to full donor chimerism occurred without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following DLI, whereas RLI led to loss of chimerism. Both RLI and DLI significantly delayed tumor mortality. In another strain combination (B10.BR [H2k]-->BALB/c [H2d]), RLI-induced or spontaneous loss of chimerism was associated with antitumor effects against the host-type B-cell lymphoma A20. HCT was essential for the antitumor effect of RLI. RLI induced elevated serum interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels, and recipient-derived IFN-gamma was critical for their antitumor effects. Thus, HVG reactions (spontaneous or induced by RLI) mediate antitumor effects against hematologic malignancies via a recipient-derived IFN-gamma-mediated mechanism. A novel approach to achieving anti-tumor effects without the risk of GVHD is suggested.",

        "Abstract": "We initiated a clinical trial of nonmyeloablative haploidentical stem-cell transplantation (SCT) using MEDI-507, an immunoglobulin-G1 monoclonal anti-CD2 antibody. The trial was based on a preclinical major histocompatibility complex-mismatched bone marrow transplant model in which graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was prevented and mixed chimerism as a platform for adoptive cellular immunotherapy was reliably induced. Twelve patients (three cohorts of four patients each) received cyclophosphamide, MEDI-507, and haploidentical unmanipulated bone marrow (n=8) or ex vivo T-cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cells (n=4) for chemorefractory hematologic malignancy. A two-dose regimen and schedule modifications of MEDI-507 were undertaken because of graft loss in the first cohort of four patients and GVHD in the second cohort. With ex vivo T-cell-depleted peripheral blood SCT, mixed chimerism occurred in all four patients without GVHD. Two patients, however, subsequently lost their grafts. Nonmyeloablative preparative therapy with MEDI-507 and haploidentical SCT have led to the reliable induction of at least transient mixed chimerism as a potential platform for adoptive cellular immunotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Alterations in inhibitory receptor expression on NK cells have been detected in mixed allogeneic chimeras and in mosaic MHC class I-expressing transgenic mice. However, it is not known whether or not NK cells are tolerant to host and donor Ags in mixed chimeras. In vitro studies have shown a lack of mutual tolerance of separated donor and host NK cells obtained from mixed chimeras. Using BALB/c-->B6 fully MHC-mismatched mixed chimeras, we have now investigated this question in vivo. Neither donor nor host NK cells in mixed chimeras showed evidence for activation, as indicated by expression of B220 and Thy-1.2 on NK cells in chimeric mice at levels similar to those in nonchimeric control mice. Lethally irradiated, established mixed BALB/c--> B6 chimeras rejected a low dose of beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient bone marrow cells (BMC) efficiently but did not reject BALB/c or B6 BMCs. In contrast, similarly conditioned B6 mice rejected both BALB/c and beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient BMCs. Thus, NK cells were specifically tolerant to the donor and the host in mixed allogeneic chimeras. The similar growth of RMA lymphoma cells in both chimeric and control B6 mice further supports the conclusion that donor BALB/c NK cells are tolerant to B6 Ags in chimeras. Administration of a high dose of exogenous IL-2 could not break NK cell tolerance in chimeric mice, suggesting that NK cell tolerance in chimeras is not due to a lack of activating cytokine. No reduction in the level of expression of the activating receptor Ly-49D, recognizing a donor MHC molecule, was detected among recipient NK cells in mixed chimeras. Thus, the present studies demonstrate that NK cells in mixed chimeras are stably tolerant to both donor and host Ags, by mechanisms that are as yet unexplained.",

        "Abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) mediated by donor T cells recognizing host alloantigens is associated with beneficial graft-versus-tumor effects in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants. Since leukemias and lymphomas reside largely within the lymphohematopoietic system, we have proposed that the desired graft-versus-leukemia or graft-versus-lymphoma effect can be separated from the complication of GvHD by confinement of the graft-versus-host alloresponse to the lymphohematopoietic tissues. Since the new sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist immunosuppressive drug FTY720 leads to trapping of T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues, we evaluated the possibility that this drug could diminish GvHD, a disease involving epithelial target tissues, while permitting a beneficial alloresponse to take place within the lymphohematopoietic system, leading to graft-versus-lymphoma effects. We demonstrate here that FTY720 markedly reduces GvHD in a clinically relevant, haploidentical strain combination, while permitting antitumor effects against a T cell lymphoma of unshared host MHC haplotype to proceed unhindered. These results establish a potential new immunotherapeutic approach to separating graft-versus-leukemia effects from GvHD.",

        "Abstract": "A 51-year-old patient with refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) received non-myeloablative conditioning and a two of six (A, B, DR) human leucocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched donor BMT. Post-BMT lymphocytes showed fluctuating T- and natural killer (NK)-cell chimerism, which culminated in mainly donor lymphocytes by Day + 100. Changes in lymphocyte chimerism correlated with anti-donor and anti-host responses in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). On Day + 100, a strong anti-host response was observed in MLR in the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), together with near complete regression of the patient's lymphoma. A mild chronic GVHD later developed and, eventually, by 680 days post-BMT, the lymphoma had relapsed and MLR reflected a state of global immune unresponsiveness. These observations demonstrate evolving host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host tolerance that correlates with fluctuating lymphoid chimerism and graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effects, in the absence of severe GVHD. Eventual lymphoma relapse temporally correlated with a generalised immunosuppressed state.",

        "Abstract": "Xenotransplantation of pig organs to humans is a possible solution to the shortage of donor organs for transplantation. Multiple immunologic barriers need to be overcome if pig-to-primate transplantation is to be successful. The presence, in humans, of natural antibodies (Abs) directed against Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc epitopes on pig vascular endothelium provides the major barrier, as antibody-antigen binding initiates the process of hyperacute rejection. Even if hyperacute rejection is prevented, acute vascular rejection develops. Acute vascular rejection is also mediated, in part, by xenoreactive Abs and may be complement-independent. Efforts being made to overcome antibody-mediated rejection include depletion of antibody by extracorporeal immunoadsorption, prevention of an induced Ab response by pharmacologic reagents, B-cell and/or plasma cell depletion, depletion or inhibition of complement, and the use of organs from pigs transgenic for human complement regulatory proteins. The ultimate solution would be the induction of B-cell tolerance to xenogeneic antigens, which is being explored by attempting to induce xenogeneic hematopoietic chimerism. Here, we review the properties of the B cell types responding to xenoantigens and the strategies for tolerizing those B cells.",

        "Abstract": "Xenospecific T-cell tolerance can be induced among murine and human T-cells by porcine thymic grafting. However, anti-alpha 1,3-galactosyltranserase (alphaGal) (Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc-R) natural antibodies (NAbs) pose a major barrier to porcine xenografts in humans. We used alphaGal knockout (KO) and muchain KO mice to explore the effect of natural anti-alphaGal and other xenoantibodies on porcine thymic engraftment and to examine the potential of thymic tissue to tolerize anti-alphaGal antibody-producing cells. Thymectomized [adult thymectomy (ATX)] non-immunized and rabbit red blood cell (RRBC) pre-transplant immunized alphaGal-KO (knockout), wild-type (WT) and mu chain KO B6 mice were treated with 3Gy total body irradiation (TBI), and T and natural killer (NK) cell depleting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). These conditioned mice were grafted with fetal porcine thymus and liver (FP THY/LIV) tissue under the kidney capsule. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to follow CD4 reconstitution as a measure of FP THY engraftment and function. Only mice with >10% CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were considered successfully engrafted. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess the kinetics of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG anti-alphaGal antibodies. Anti-pig antibodies were monitored by flow cytometry (FCM). FP THY engrafted successfully in most of the immunoglobulin deficient mice (11 out of 12, 92%) and the outcome was similar in WT B6 controls (8 out of 12, 67%). Non-immunized alphaGal-KO mice grafted with FP THY had a similar success rate (7 out of 11) to that observed in non-immunized alphaGal-WT controls (2 out of 4). In contrast, alphaGal-KO mice immunized pre-transplant with RRBC, then grafted with FP THY/LIV, showed a significant reduction in the success of thymic grafting (2 out of 9, 22%) compared with pre-transplant immunized WT controls (4 out of 7; 57%) and non-immunized alphaGal-KO mice (7 out of 11, 64%). Anti-Gal and anti-pig antibody levels were not markedly augmented by porcine thymus grafts in mice with successful thymus grafts. FP THY engraftment is impaired in the presence of high levels of anti-alphaGal xenoantibodies. However, low levels of anti-alphaGal antibodies and other mouse anti-pig NAbs appear not to play a major role in the rejection of FP THY. Although grafting FP THY expressing the alphaGal epitope did not tolerize B cells producing anti-alphaGal antibodies in a T-cell independent manner, it prevented T-cell dependent sensitization by inducing T-cell tolerance to porcine antigens.",

        "Abstract": "CD4 repopulation can be achieved in T cell-depleted, thymectomized mice grafted with xenogeneic porcine thymus tissue. These CD4 T cells are specifically tolerant of the xenogeneic porcine thymus donor and the recipient, but are positively selected only by porcine MHC. Recent studies suggest that optimal peripheral survival of naive CD4 T cells requires the presence of the same class II MHC in the periphery as that of the thymus in which they were selected. These observations would suggest that T cells selected on porcine thymic MHC would die rapidly in the periphery, where porcine MHC is absent. Persistent CD4 reconstitution achieved in mice grafted with fetal porcine thymus might be due to increased thymic output to compensate for rapid death of T cells in the periphery. Comparison of CD4 T cell decay after removal of porcine or murine thymic grafts ruled out this possibility. No measurable role for peripheral murine class II MHC in maintaining the naive CD4 pool originating in thymic grafts was demonstrable. However, mouse class II MHC supported the conversion to, survival, and/or proliferation of memory-type CD4 cells selected in fetal porcine thymus. Thus, the same MHC as that mediating positive selection in the thymus is not critical for maintenance of the memory CD4 cell pool in the periphery. Our results support the interpretation that xenogeneic thymic transplantation is a feasible strategy to reconstitute CD4 T cells and render recipients tolerant of a xenogeneic donor.",

        "Abstract": "Side-population (SP) cells are a recently described rare cell population detected in selected tissues of various mammalian species, but not yet described in the peripheral circulation. In the present study, we have identified for the first time SP cells in lineage-negative adult human blood and have provided an extensive functional and immunophenotypic characterization of these cells. Adult peripheral blood was depleted of mature leukocyte cell types by density gradient and immunomagnetic separation. The SP cell population was identified by its characteristic Hoechst 33342 profile. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed that blood SP cells expressed high levels of CD45, CD59, CD43, CD49d, CD31, and integrin markers and lacked CD34. Highly purified SP cells were put into cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC), long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC), and liquid cell culture assays; repopulating assays were performed utilizing nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Circulating SP cells were shown to exhibit verapamil sensitivity and a low growth rate. LTC-IC, CAFC, and engraftment assays indicated that circulating SP cells had lost the multipotentiality described in murine bone marrow SP cells. However, outgrowth of mature cell types from liquid cell culture suggests the presence of common lymphoid (T and natural killer) and dendritic cell precursor(s) within circulating SP cell populations. The absence of SP cell growth in the LTC-IC, CAFC, and repopulating assays might be intrinsic to the tissue source (marrow versus blood) or species (mouse versus human) tested. Thus, human blood SP cells, although rare, may serve as a source of selected leukocyte progenitor cells. The immunophenotype of circulating SP cells may provide clues to their seeding and homing capacity.",

        "Abstract": "In mice, donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) given to established mixed allogeneic chimeras can mediate powerful graft-versus-host (GVH) reactions confined to the lymphohematopoietic system without inducing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In a clinical trial attempting to capture this approach to achieve graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effects without GVHD, we have observed surprisingly powerful antitumor effects of DLI in patients achieving mixed chimerism after nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplantation. This observation led us to hypothesize that host antigen-presenting cells in mixed chimeras might be required to optimally present recipient antigens to the donor lymphocytes, leading to maximal graft-versus-tumor effects. To test this hypothesis, we established mixed and fully allogeneic hematopoietic chimeras in B6 mice and evaluated the effect of DLI on EL4 T-cell lymphoma. DLI administration to mixed chimeras produced dramatically improved leukemia-free survival compared to administration of DLI to full donor chimeras. DLI also converted mixed chimeras to full chimeras without causing GVHD. The magnitude of the GVL effect was dependent on the level of major histocompatibility complex class I expression on recipient hematopoietic cells in mixed chimeras. Thus, the induction of mixed chimerism followed by delayed DLI provides an approach to inhibiting GVHD that optimizes GVL effects.",

        "Abstract": "To combat the shortage of donor organs, transplantation across species barriers has been proposed. Induction of tolerance would overcome the substantial immunologic barriers to xenotransplantation and would avoid the chronic use of immunosuppressive agents. Successful transplantation of hematopoietic cells induces robust specific tolerance to donor antigens in allogeneic and xenogeneic models. The beta1 integrin class of adhesion molecules and their interactions with extracellular matrix components are thought to be integral to the engraftment and maturation of hematopoietic stem cells. We therefore examined the efficacy of porcine very late antigen-5 (VLA-5) and VLA-4 interactions with the human extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, fibronectin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from humans and miniature swine were flourochrome labeled and adhesion to plates coated with whole human fibronectin (whFN) or its 120 KDa fragment containing the VLA-5 binding region was determined. Flow cytometry and immuno- precipitation were used to identify a monoclonal antibody that cross-reacted on porcine VLA-5. Human and pig PBMC adhesion to human fibronectin (hFN) or 120 kDa fragment-coated plates was assessed following incubation with control ab, anti-VLA-4, anti-VLA-5, or soluble fibronectin. Using rabbit complement, cells expressing VLA-5 were purged from PBMC preparations before performing the adhesion assay. Porcine and human PBMC both adhered to hFN in a divalent cation-dependent and activation-dependent manner. Adhesion to hFN of human but not pig PBMC was blocked by anti-VLA-5 monoclonal antibody SAM-1, although this mAb immunoprecipitated a heterodimeric cell surface molecule (155/135 kDa) resembling VLA-5 from pig PBMC. Complement-mediated depletion of VLA-5-expressing cells ablated specific binding of human but not porcine cells to hFN and its 120 kDa fragment. Addition of soluble fibronectin was capable of blocking adhesion of PBMC of both species to hFN. Anti-VLA-4 reduced the binding of PBMC from both species to hFN to a similar extent. Human and pig cells can specifically adhere to hFN and its 120 kDa fragment, suggesting that this critical cell-ECM interaction is preserved across species. While human cells exclusively use VLA-5 for binding to the 120 kDa fragment, porcine cells could not be shown to adhere to whFN or its 120 kDa fragment via VLA-5. However, porcine VLA-4 is capable of mediating adhesion to human FN. We conclude that disparities in the adhesive interactions of beta1 integrins may be a barrier to the use of porcine hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a means of inducing donor-specific tolerance in the pig to human species combination.",

        "Abstract": "In a recently developed murine model for the induction of mixed chimerism and tolerance, hosts are treated with T cell depleting monoclonal antibodies (TCD mAbs; days -5, -1 and +7), thymic irradiation (TI) (7 Gy), and a high dose of fully allogeneic bone marrow cells (BMC, 200 x 10(6)). To find the minimum amount of each treatment required for success with this approach, we treated groups with (1) a lower dose of TI (3.5 Gy), (2) fewer BMC (100 x 10(6)), (3) no TI, (4) no TI plus additional TCD mAbs on day +14, or (5) fewer injections of TCD mAbs (day -5 only). Chimerism was followed by flow cytometry (FCM), and tolerance was assessed by skin grafting. Without TI, no long-term chimerism or tolerance could be induced, even when an additional dose of TCD mAbs was administered on day +14. A reduction in the dose of either BMC or TI led to substantially reduced effectiveness, as demonstrated by lower levels of chimerism and poorer donor skin graft survival. However, the dose of TCD mAbs and hence the duration of recipient T cell depletion could be safely reduced and thus the potential toxicity of the conditioning regimen lowered.",

        "Abstract": "The graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-inducing activity of CD8 T cells was compared in murine recipients of wild-type (WT) or interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-deficient (GKO) allogeneic donor cells. CD8 T cells (or CD4-depleted splenocytes) from GKO donor mice induced more severe GVHD in lethally irradiated allogeneic recipients compared to the same cell populations from WT donors. Consistent with GVHD severity, donor CD8 T-cell expansion in allogeneic recipients was augmented in the absence of IFN-gamma. These results demonstrate that IFN-gamma does not stimulate but instead down-modulates GVHD induced by donor CD8 T cells. Remarkably, antihost lymphohematopoietic reactions, including GVL effects against host leukemia/lymphoma cells, of CD8 T cells correlated inversely with their GVHD-inducing activity, and those of GKO donors were markedly weaker than those mediated by WT donor CD8 T cells. These data show for the first time that GVHD-inducing activity and GVL effects of allogeneic CD8 T cells can be separated by a single cytokine, IFN-gamma. (Blood. 2002;99:4207-4215)",

        "Title": "Mixed chimerism induces donor-specific T-cell tolerance across a highly disparate xenogeneic barrier.",
        "Abstract": "Induction of tolerance is likely to be essential for successful xenotransplantation because immune responses across xenogeneic barriers are vigorous. Although mixed hematopoietic chimerism leads to stable donor-specific tolerance in allogeneic and closely related xenogeneic (eg, rat-to-mouse) combinations, the ability of this approach to induce tolerance across a highly disparate xenogeneic barrier has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we investigated the immune responses of murine T cells that developed in mice with pre-established porcine hematopoietic chimerism. Our results show for the first time that induction of porcine hematopoietic chimerism can eliminate the development of antiporcine donor responses in a highly disparate xenogeneic species. Porcine hematopoietic chimeras showed donor-specific nonresponsiveness in the mixed lymphocyte reaction, lack of antidonor IgG antibody production, and acceptance of donor skin grafts. Thus, mixed chimerism is capable of inducing tolerance in a highly disparate xenogeneic combination and may have clinical potential to prevent xenograft rejection. (Blood. 2002;99:3823-3829)",
