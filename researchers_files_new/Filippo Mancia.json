        "Abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential structural component of the bacterial cell wall that is synthetized during cell division and elongation. PG forms an extracellular polymer crucial for cellular viability, the synthesis of which is the target of many antibiotics. PG assembly requires a glycosyltransferase (GT) to generate a glycan polymer using a Lipid II substrate, which is then crosslinked to the existing PG via a transpeptidase (TP) reaction. A Shape, Elongation, Division and Sporulation (SEDS) GT enzyme and a Class B Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) form the core of the multi-protein complex required for PG assembly. Here we used single particle cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of a cell elongation-specific E. coli RodA-PBP2 complex. We combine this information with biochemical, genetic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses to identify the Lipid II binding sites and propose a mechanism for Lipid II polymerization. Our data suggest a hypothesis for the movement of the glycan strand from the Lipid II polymerization site of RodA towards the TP site of PBP2, functionally linking these two central enzymatic activities required for cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis.",

        "Title": "Gone with the Wnt(less): a mechanistic perspective on the journey of Wnt.",
        "Abstract": "Wnts are short-range signaling proteins, expressed in all metazoans from sponges to humans, critical for cell development and fate. There are 19 different Wnts in the human genome with varying expression levels and patterns, and post-translational modifications. Common to essentially all Wnts is the palmitoleation of a conserved serine by the O-acyltransferase PORCN in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). All lipidated Wnts then bind a dedicated carrier Wntless (WLS), endowed with the task of transporting them from the ER to the plasma membrane, and ultimately facilitating their release to receptors on the Wnt-receiving cell to initiate signaling. Here, we will focus on the WLS-mediated transport step. There are currently two published structures, both obtained by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy of the Wnt/WLS complex: human Wnt8A-bound and human Wnt3A-bound WLS. We analyze the two Wnt/WLS structures - remarkably similar despite the sequence similarity between Wnt8A and Wnt3A being only ∼39% - to begin to understand the conserved nature of this binding mechanism, and ultimately how one carrier can accommodate a family of 19 different Wnts. By comparing how Wnt associates with WLS with how it binds to PORCN and FZD receptors, we can begin to speculate on mechanisms of Wnt transfer from PORCN to WLS, and from WLS to FZD, thus providing molecular-level insight into these essential steps of the Wnt signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "The mycobacteria genus is responsible for numerous infectious diseases that have afflicted the human race since antiquity-tuberculosis and leprosy in particular. An important contributor to their evolutionary success is their unique cell envelope, which constitutes a quasi-impermeable barrier, protecting the microorganism from external threats, antibiotics included. The arabinofuranosyltransferases are a family of enzymes, unique to the Actinobacteria family that mycobacteria genus belongs to, that are critical to building of this cell envelope. In this chapter, we will analyze available structures of members of the mycobacterial arabinofuranosyltransferase, clarify their function, as well as explore the common themes present amongst this family of enzymes, as revealed by recent research.",

Following a broad screen of sequence space to identify initial expression-positive targets, we employ a second step to select orthologs with closely related sequences to these hits. We demonstrate that a greater percentage of these latter targets express well and are stable in detergent, increasing the likelihood of identifying candidates that will ultimately yield structural information.",

        "Abstract": "Infectious diseases present a major threat to public health globally. Pathogens can acquire resistance to anti-infectious agents via several means including transporter-mediated efflux. Typically, multidrug transporters feature spacious, dynamic, and chemically malleable binding sites to aid in the recognition and transport of chemically diverse substrates across cell membranes. Here, we discuss recent structural investigations of multidrug transporters involved in resistance to infectious diseases that belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the drug/metabolite transporter (DMT) superfamily, the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, the small multidrug resistance (SMR) family, and the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) superfamily. These structural insights provide invaluable information for understanding and combatting multidrug resistance.",

        "Abstract": "Wnts are evolutionarily conserved ligands that signal at short range to regulate morphogenesis, cell fate, and stem cell renewal. The first and essential steps in Wnt secretion are their O-palmitoleation and subsequent loading onto the dedicated transporter Wntless/evenness interrupted (WLS/Evi). We report the 3.2 Å resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of palmitoleated human WNT8A in complex with WLS. This is accompanied by biochemical experiments to probe the physiological implications of the observed association. The WLS membrane domain has close structural homology to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A Wnt hairpin inserts into a conserved hydrophobic cavity in the GPCR-like domain, and the palmitoleate protrudes between two helices into the bilayer. A conformational switch of highly conserved residues on a separate Wnt hairpin might contribute to its transfer to receiving cells. This work provides molecular-level insights into a central mechanism in animal body plan development and stem cell biology.",

        "Abstract": "Structure determination of membrane proteins is critical to the molecular understanding of many life processes, yet it has historically been a technically challenging endeavor. This past decade has given rise to a number of technological advancements, techniques, and reagents, which have facilitated membrane protein structural biology, resulting in an ever-growing number of membrane protein structures determined. To collate these advances, we have mined available literature to analyze the purification and structure determination specifics for all uniquely solved membrane protein structures from 2010 to 2019. Our analyses demonstrate the strong impact of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy on the field and illustrate how this technique has affected detergent and membrane mimetic usage. Furthermore, we detail how different structure determination methods, taxonomic domains and protein classes have unique detergent/membrane mimetic profiles, highlighting the importance of tailoring their selection. Our analyses provide a quantitative overview of where the field of membrane protein structural biology stands and how it has developed over time. We anticipate that these will serve as a useful tool to streamline future membrane protein structure determination by guiding the choice of detergent/membrane mimetic.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in single-particle cryogenic-electron microscopy have facilitated an exponential growth in the number of membrane protein structures determined to close to atomic resolution. Nevertheless, despite improvements in microscope hardware, cryo-EM software and sample preparation techniques, challenges remain for structural analysis of small-sized membrane proteins (i.e.<150 kilodalton). Here we discuss recent examples of structures of macromolecules from this category determined by cryo-EM. We analyze the underlying difficulties, the enabling technologies such as the use of antibody fragments to gain size and provide fiducials for particle alignment, and the unresolved issues like dislocation of complexes at the air-water interface. Finally, we briefly highlight the biological relevance of some of these success stories, and our predictions for the future.",

        "Abstract": "In mycobacteria, phosphatidylinositol (PI) acts as a common lipid anchor for key components of the cell wall, including the glycolipids phosphatidylinositol mannoside, lipomannan, and lipoarabinomannan. Glycolipids in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, are important virulence factors that modulate the host immune response. The identity-defining step in PI biosynthesis in prokaryotes, unique to mycobacteria and few other bacterial species, is the reaction between cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol and inositol-phosphate to yield phosphatidylinositol-phosphate, the immediate precursor to PI. This reaction is catalyzed by the cytidine diphosphate-alcohol phosphotransferase phosphatidylinositol-phosphate synthase (PIPS), an essential enzyme for mycobacterial viability. Here we present structures of PIPS from Mycobacterium kansasii with and without evidence of donor and acceptor substrate binding obtained using a crystal engineering approach. PIPS from Mycobacterium kansasii is 86% identical to the ortholog from M. tuberculosis and catalytically active. Functional experiments guided by our structural results allowed us to further characterize the molecular determinants of substrate specificity and catalysis in a new mycobacterial species. This work provides a framework to strengthen our understanding of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate biosynthesis in the context of mycobacterial pathogens.",

        "Abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis, a disease that kills over 1 million people each year. Its cell envelope is a common antibiotic target and has a unique structure due, in part, to two lipidated polysaccharides-arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan. Arabinofuranosyltransferase D (AftD) is an essential enzyme involved in assembling these glycolipids. We present the 2.9-Å resolution structure of M. abscessus AftD, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. AftD has a conserved GT-C glycosyltransferase fold and three carbohydrate-binding modules. Glycan array analysis shows that AftD binds complex arabinose glycans. Additionally, AftD is non-covalently complexed with an acyl carrier protein (ACP). 3.4- and 3.5-Å structures of a mutant with impaired ACP binding reveal a conformational change, suggesting that ACP may regulate AftD function. Mutagenesis experiments using a conditional knockout constructed in M. smegmatis confirm the essentiality of the putative active site and the ACP binding for AftD function.",

        "Abstract": "STRA6 (stimulated by retinoic acid 6) is a 75kDa polytopic transmembrane protein that facilitates cellular retinol uptake from retinol-binding protein (RBP). Structural characterization of STRA6 from Danio rerio purified in detergent and reconstituted in amphipol A8-35 was achieved by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This provided the first high-resolution snapshot of this protein, showing a novel topology of a tightly assembled homodimer, and an unexpected physiological association with calmodulin in addition to insights into its potential mechanism of function. Specifically, a large hydrophobic cavity in the center of STRA6 linked to the known site of interaction with RBP suggested a route of retinol entry into the cell by diffusion into the membrane through a lateral opening of the cavity directly into the bilayer. Moreover, the capability to produce pure and homogeneous protein has allowed previously unattainable functional characterization of STRA6 in a reconstituted system. Here, we describe detailed methods for Danio rerio STRA6 expression in insect cells, purification in detergent and reconstitution in amphipol for structural characterization by cryo-EM. Furthermore, we show reconstitution of the protein in liposomes for an in vitro proteoliposome-based assay of STRA6-mediated retinol uptake. Finally, we present methods and preliminary cryo-EM data for STRA6 incorporated in lipid-filled nanodiscs, a close to native milieu to study membrane protein structure and function.",

        "Abstract": "The membrane-water interface forms a uniquely heterogeneous and geometrically constrained environment for enzymatic catalysis. Integral membrane enzymes sample three environments - the uniformly hydrophobic interior of the membrane, the aqueous extramembrane region, and the fuzzy, amphipathic interfacial region formed by the tightly packed headgroups of the components of the lipid bilayer. Depending on the nature of the substrates and the location of the site of chemical modification, catalysis may occur in each of these environments. The availability of structural information for alpha-helical enzyme families from each of these classes, as well as several beta-barrel enzymes from the bacterial outer membrane, has allowed us to review here the different ways in which each enzyme fold has adapted to the nature of the substrates, products, and the unique environment of the membrane. Our focus here is on enzymes that process lipidic substrates. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Bacterial Lipids edited by Russell E. Bishop.",

        "Abstract": "Vitamin A homeostasis is critical to normal cellular function. Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is the sole specific carrier in the bloodstream for hydrophobic retinol, the main form in which vitamin A is transported. The integral membrane receptor STRA6 mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A by recognizing RBP-retinol to trigger release and internalization of retinol. We present the structure of zebrafish STRA6 determined to 3.9-angstrom resolution by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. STRA6 has one intramembrane and nine transmembrane helices in an intricate dimeric assembly. Unexpectedly, calmodulin is bound tightly to STRA6 in a noncanonical arrangement. Residues involved with RBP binding map to an archlike structure that covers a deep lipophilic cleft. This cleft is open to the membrane, suggesting a possible mode for internalization of retinol through direct diffusion into the lipid bilayer.",

        "Abstract": "Polymyxins are antibiotics used in the last line of defense to combat multidrug-resistant infections by Gram-negative bacteria. Polymyxin resistance arises through charge modification of the bacterial outer membrane with the attachment of the cationic sugar 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose to lipid A, a reaction catalyzed by the integral membrane lipid-to-lipid glycosyltransferase 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose transferase (ArnT). Here, we report crystal structures of ArnT from Cupriavidus metallidurans, alone and in complex with the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate, at 2.8 and 3.2 angstrom resolution, respectively. The structures show cavities for both lipidic substrates, which converge at the active site. A structural rearrangement occurs on undecaprenyl phosphate binding, which stabilizes the active site and likely allows lipid A binding. Functional mutagenesis experiments based on these structures suggest a mechanistic model for ArnT family enzymes.",

        "Abstract": "The attachment of a sugar to a hydrophobic polyisoprenyl carrier is the first step for all extracellular glycosylation processes. The enzymes that perform these reactions, polyisoprenyl-glycosyltransferases (PI-GTs) include dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (DPMS), which generates the mannose donor for glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report the 3.0 Å resolution crystal structure of GtrB, a glucose-specific PI-GT from Synechocystis, showing a tetramer in which each protomer contributes two helices to a membrane-spanning bundle. The active site is 15 Å from the membrane, raising the question of how water-soluble and membrane-embedded substrates are brought into apposition for catalysis. A conserved juxtamembrane domain harbours disease mutations, which compromised activity in GtrB in vitro and in human DPM1 tested in zebrafish. We hypothesize a role of this domain in shielding the polyisoprenyl-phosphate for transport to the active site. Our results reveal the basis of PI-GT function, and provide a potential molecular explanation for DPM1-related disease.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol is critical for intracellular signalling and anchoring of carbohydrates and proteins to outer cellular membranes. The defining step in phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis is catalysed by CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases, transmembrane enzymes that use CDP-diacylglycerol as donor substrate for this reaction, and either inositol in eukaryotes or inositol phosphate in prokaryotes as the acceptor alcohol. Here we report the structures of a related enzyme, the phosphatidylinositol-phosphate synthase from Renibacterium salmoninarum, with and without bound CDP-diacylglycerol to 3.6 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively. These structures reveal the location of the acceptor site, and the molecular determinants of substrate specificity and catalysis. Functional characterization of the 40%-identical ortholog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potential target for the development of novel anti-tuberculosis drugs, supports the proposed mechanism of substrate binding and catalysis. This work therefore provides a structural and functional framework to understand the mechanism of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate biosynthesis.",

        "Abstract": "The CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase (CDP-AP) family of integral membrane enzymes catalyses the transfer of a substituted phosphate group from a CDP-linked donor to an alcohol acceptor. This is an essential reaction for phospholipid biosynthesis across all kingdoms of life, and it is catalysed solely by CDP-APs. Here we report the 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of a representative CDP-AP from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The enzyme (AF2299) is a homodimer, with each protomer consisting of six transmembrane helices and an N-terminal cytosolic domain. A polar cavity within the membrane accommodates the active site, lined with the residues from an absolutely conserved CDP-AP signature motif (D(1)xxD(2)G(1)xxAR...G(2)xxxD(3)xxxD(4)). Structures in the apo, CMP-bound, CDP-bound and CDP-glycerol-bound states define functional roles for each of these eight conserved residues and allow us to propose a sequential, base-catalysed mechanism universal for CDP-APs, in which the fourth aspartate (D4) acts as the catalytic base.",

        "Abstract": "Structural and functional studies of many mammalian systems are critically dependent on abundant supplies of recombinant multiprotein complexes. Mammalian cells are often the most ideal, if not the only suitable host for such experiments. This is due to their intrinsic capability to generate functional mammalian proteins. This advantage is frequently countered by problems with yields in expression, time required to generate overexpressing lines, and elevated costs. Coexpression of multiple proteins adds another level of complexity to these experiments, as cells need to be screened and selected for expression of suitable levels of each component. Here, we present an efficient fluorescence marking procedure for establishing stable cell lines that overexpress two proteins in coordination, and we validate the method in the production of recombinant monoclonal antibody Fab fragments. This procedure may readily be expanded to systems of greater complexity, comprising more than two components.",

        "Abstract": "High-throughput (HT) methodologies have had a tremendous impact on structural biology of soluble proteins. High-resolution structure determination relies on the ability of the macromolecule to form ordered crystals that diffract X-rays. While crystallization remains somewhat empirical, for a given protein, success is proportional to the number of conditions screened and to the number of variants trialed. HT techniques have greatly increased the number of targets that can be trialed and the rate at which these can be produced. In terms of number of structures solved, membrane proteins appear to be lagging many years behind their soluble counterparts. Likewise, HT methodologies for production and characterization of these hydrophobic macromolecules are only now emerging. Presented here is an HT platform designed exclusively for membrane proteins that has processed over 5000 targets.",

        "Abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) respond to external stimuli by activating heterotrimeric G proteins inside the cell. There is increasing evidence that many GPCRs exist as dimers or higher oligomers, but the biochemical nature of such dimers and what roles they have, if any, in signal transduction remains unclear. We conducted a comprehensive study of dimerization of the 5HT2c serotonin receptor using disulphide-trapping experiments. We found a dimer interface between transmembrane (TM) helices IV and V that is markedly sensitive to the state of receptor activation. This dimer seems to be quasisymmetrical in interfacial geometry and asymmetrical in its association with its cognate G alpha protein. We also found a second interface at TM I helices, which is insensitive to the state of activation.",

We present an efficient fluorescence marking procedure for establishing stable cell lines that overexpress two proteins in co-ordination, and we validate the method in the production of monoclonal antibody Fab fragments. The procedure has worked without fail on all seven of seven trials on Fabs, which are being used in the crystallization of G-protein coupled receptors. This manner of efficient selection may readily be adapted for the co-production of other complexes of two or more proteins.",

We immunized mice with the rat 5HT2c serotonin receptor and derived clonal hybridoma cells, which we tested for specific antigen reactivity by using the complementarity of purified protein from bacteria and receptor-embedded mammalian cell membranes. Nine mAbs met our criteria for specificity, affinity, and sensitivity to conformational features. Epitopes were mapped in various additional tests. Five of the nine mAbs have cytoplasmic epitopes, and two of these are sensitive to the ligand state of the receptor. These properties should be useful both for structural analysis and in probes of function.",

Many express poorly in bacterial systems, whereas it can be time consuming and expensive to produce them from cells of higher organisms. Here we describe a procedure for the direct selection of stable mammalian cell lines that express proteins of interest in high yield. Coexpression of a marker protein, such as green fluorescent protein, is linked to that of the desired protein through an internal ribosome entry site in the vector that is transfected into cells in culture. The coexpressed marker is used to select for highly expressing clonal cell lines. Applications are described to a membrane protein, the 5HT2c serotonin receptor, and to a secreted cysteine-rich protein, resistin. Besides providing an expeditious means for producing mammalian proteins for structural work, the resulting cell lines also readily support tests of functional properties and structure-inspired hypotheses.",
