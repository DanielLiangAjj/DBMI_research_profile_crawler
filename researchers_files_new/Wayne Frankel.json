        "Abstract": "Effective gene therapy for gain-of-function or dominant-negative disease mutations may require eliminating expression of the mutant copy together with wild-type replacement. We evaluated such a knockdown-replace strategy in a mouse model of DNM1 disease, a debilitating and intractable neurodevelopmental epilepsy. To challenge the approach robustly, we expressed a patient-based variant in GABAergic neurons-which resulted in growth delay and lethal seizures evident by postnatal week three-and delivered to newborn pups an AAV9-based vector encoding a ubiquitously expressed, Dnm1-specific interfering RNA (RNAi) bivalently in tail-to-tail configuration with a neuron-specific, RNAi-resistant, codon-optimized Dnm1 cDNA. Pups receiving RNAi or cDNA alone fared no better than untreated pups, whereas the vast majority of mutants receiving modest doses survived with almost full growth recovery. Synaptic recordings of cortical neurons derived from treated pups revealed that significant alterations in transmission from inhibitory to excitatory neurons were rectified by bivalent vector application. To examine the mutant transcriptome and impact of treatment, we used RNA sequencing and functional annotation clustering. Mutants displayed abnormal expression of more than 1,000 genes in highly significant and relevant functional clusters, clusters that were abrogated by treatment. Together these results suggest knockdown-replace as a potentially effective strategy for treating DNM1 and related genetic neurodevelopmental disease.",

        "Abstract": "NMDA receptors play crucial roles in excitatory synaptic transmission. Rare variants in GRIN2A encoding the GluN2A subunit are associated with a spectrum of disorders, ranging from mild speech and language delay to intractable neurodevelopmental disorders, including but not limited to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. A de novo missense variant, p.Ser644Gly, was identified in a child with this disorder, and Grin2a knock-in mice were generated to model and extend understanding of this intractable childhood disease. Homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice exhibited altered hippocampal morphology at 2 weeks of age, and all homozygotes exhibited lethal tonic-clonic seizures by mid-third week. Heterozygous adults displayed susceptibility to induced generalized seizures, hyperactivity, repetitive and reduced anxiety behaviours, plus several unexpected features, including significant resistance to electrically-induced limbic seizures and to pentylenetetrazole induced tonic-clonic seizures. Multielectrode recordings of neuronal networks revealed hyperexcitability and altered bursting and synchronicity. In heterologous cells, mutant receptors had enhanced NMDA receptor agonist potency and slow deactivation following rapid removal of glutamate, as occurs at synapses. NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in heterozygous hippocampal slices also showed a prolonged deactivation time course. Standard anti-epileptic drug monotherapy was ineffective in the patient. Introduction of NMDA receptor antagonists was correlated with a decrease in seizure burden. Chronic treatment of homozygous mouse pups with NMDA receptor antagonists significantly delayed the onset of lethal seizures but did not prevent them. These studies illustrate the power of using multiple experimental modalities to model and test therapies for severe neurodevelopmental disorders, while revealing significant biological complexities associated with GRIN2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.",

        "Abstract": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) associated with de novo variants in the gene encoding dynamin-1 (DNM1) is a severe debilitating disease with no pharmacological remedy. Like most genetic DEEs, the majority of DNM1 patients suffer from therapy-resistant seizures and comorbidities such as intellectual disability, developmental delay, and hypotonia. We tested RNAi gene therapy in the Dnm1 fitful mouse model of DEE using a Dnm1-targeted therapeutic microRNA delivered by a self-complementary adeno-associated virus vector. Untreated or control-injected fitful mice have growth delay, severe ataxia, and lethal tonic-clonic seizures by 3 weeks of age. These major impairments are mitigated following a single treatment in newborn mice, along with key underlying cellular features including gliosis, cell death, and aberrant neuronal metabolic activity typically associated with recurrent seizures.

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the X-linked gene IQSEC2 are associated with multiple cases of epilepsy, epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, the mechanistic understanding and successful treatment of which remain a significant challenge in IQSEC2 and related neurodevelopmental genetic diseases. To investigate disease etiology, we studied behaviors and synaptic function in IQSEC2 deficient mice. Hemizygous Iqsec2 null males exhibit growth deficits, hyperambulation and hyperanxiety phenotypes. Adult hemizygotes experience lethal spontaneous seizures, but paradoxically have a significantly increased threshold to electrically induced limbic seizures and relative resistance to chemically induced seizures. Although there are no gross defects in brain morphology, hemizygotes exhibit stark hippocampal reactive astrogliosis. Electrophysiological recordings of hippocampal neurons reveal increased excitatory drive specifically onto interneurons, and significant alterations in intrinsic electrical properties specific to the interneuron population. As they age, hemizygotes also develop an increased abundance of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus, neurons in which IQSEC2 is expressed in addition to the excitatory neurons. These findings point to a novel role of IQSEC2 in hippocampal interneuron synaptic function and development with implications for a class of intractable neurodevelopmental diseases.",

        "Abstract": "RNA-protein interaction plays important roles in post-transcriptional regulation. Recent advancements in cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq) technologies make it possible to detect the binding peaks of a given RNA binding protein (RBP) at transcriptome scale. However, it is still challenging to predict the functional consequences of RBP binding peaks. In this study, we propose the Protein-RNA Association Strength (PRAS), which integrates the intensities and positions of the binding peaks of RBPs for functional mRNA targets prediction. We illustrate the superiority of PRAS over existing approaches on predicting the functional targets of two related but divergent CELF (CUGBP, ELAV-like factor) RBPs in mouse brain and muscle. We also demonstrate the potential of PRAS for wide adoption by applying it to the enhanced CLIP-seq (eCLIP) datasets of 37 RNA decay related RBPs in two human cell lines. PRAS can be utilized to investigate any RBPs with available CLIP-seq peaks. PRAS is freely available at http://ouyanglab.jax.org/pras/.",

        "Abstract": "Absence epilepsy (AE) is a common type of genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), particularly in children. AE and GGE are complex genetic diseases with few causal variants identified to date. Gria4 deficient mice provide a model of AE, one for which the common laboratory inbred strain C3H/HeJ (HeJ) harbors a natural IAP retrotransposon insertion in Gria4 that reduces its expression 8-fold. Between C3H and non-seizing strains such as C57BL/6, genetic modifiers alter disease severity. Even C3H substrains have surprising variation in the duration and incidence of spike-wave discharges (SWD), the characteristic electroencephalographic feature of absence seizures. Here we discovered extensive IAP retrotransposition in the C3H substrain, and identified a HeJ-private IAP in the Pcnxl2 gene, which encodes a putative multi-transmembrane protein of unknown function, resulting in decreased expression. By creating new Pcnxl2 frameshift alleles using TALEN mutagenesis, we show that Pcnxl2 deficiency is responsible for mitigating the seizure phenotype - making Pcnxl2 the first known modifier gene for absence seizures in any species. This finding gave us a handle on genetic complexity between strains, directing us to use another C3H substrain to map additional modifiers including validation of a Chr 15 locus that profoundly affects the severity of SWD episodes. Together these new findings expand our knowledge of how natural variation modulates seizures, and highlights the feasibility of characterizing and validating modifiers in mouse strains and substrains in the post-genome sequence era.",

        "Title": "CELF4 regulates translation and local abundance of a vast set of mRNAs, including genes associated with regulation of synaptic function.",
        "Abstract": "RNA-binding proteins have emerged as causal agents of complex neurological diseases. Mice deficient for neuronal RNA-binding protein CELF4 have a complex neurological disorder with epilepsy as a prominent feature. Human CELF4 has recently been associated with clinical features similar to those seen in mutant mice. CELF4 is expressed primarily in excitatory neurons, including large pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and it regulates excitatory but not inhibitory neurotransmission. We examined mechanisms underlying neuronal hyperexcitability in Celf4 mutants by identifying CELF4 target mRNAs and assessing their fate in the absence of CELF4 in view of their known functions. CELF4 binds to at least 15%-20% of the transcriptome, with striking specificity for the mRNA 3' untranslated region. CELF4 mRNA targets encode a variety of proteins, many of which are well established in neuron development and function. While the overall abundance of these mRNA targets is often dysregulated in Celf4 deficient mice, the actual expression changes are modest at the steady-state level. In contrast, by examining the transcriptome of polysome fractions and the mRNA distribution along the neuronal cell body-neuropil axis, we found that CELF4 is critical for maintaining mRNA stability and availability for translation. Among biological processes associated with CELF4 targets that accumulate in neuropil of mutants, regulation of synaptic plasticity and transmission are the most prominent. Together with a related study of the impact of CELF4 loss on sodium channel Na(v)1.6 function, we suggest that CELF4 deficiency leads to abnormal neuronal function by combining a specific effect on neuronal excitation with a general impairment of synaptic transmission. These results also expand our understanding of the vital roles RNA-binding proteins play in regulating and shaping the activity of neural circuits.",

        "Title": "Aberrant sodium channel activity in the complex seizure disorder of Celf4 mutant mice.",
        "Abstract": "Mice deficient for CELF4, a neuronal RNA-binding protein, have a complex seizure disorder that includes both convulsive and non-convulsive seizures, and is dependent upon Celf4 gene dosage and mouse strain background. It was previously shown that Celf4 is expressed predominantly in excitatory neurons, and that deficiency results in abnormal excitatory synaptic neurotransmission. To examine the physiological and molecular basis of this, we studied Celf4-deficient neurons in brain slices. Assessment of intrinsic properties of layer V cortical pyramidal neurons showed that neurons from mutant heterozygotes and homozygotes have a lower action potential (AP) initiation threshold and a larger AP gain when compared with wild-type neurons. Celf4 mutant neurons also demonstrate an increase in persistent sodium current (I(NaP)) and a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation. As part of a related study, we find that CELF4 directly binds Scn8a mRNA, encoding sodium channel Na(v)1.6, the primary instigator of AP at the axon initial segment (AIS) and the main carrier of I(NaP). In the present study we find that CELF4 deficiency results in a dramatic elevation in the expression of Na(v)1.6 protein at the AIS in both null and heterozygous neurons. Together these results suggest that activation of Na(v)1.6 plays a crucial role in seizure generation in this complex model of neurological disease.",

        "Title": "A novel Akt3 mutation associated with enhanced kinase activity and seizure susceptibility in mice.",
        "Abstract": "In a phenotype-driven mutagenesis screen, a novel, dominant mouse mutation, Nmf350, caused low seizure threshold, sporadic tonic-clonic seizures, brain enlargement and ectopic neurons in the dentate hilus and molecular layer of the hippocampus. Genetic mapping implicated Akt3, one of four candidates within the critical interval. Sequencing analysis revealed that mutants have a missense mutation in Akt3 (encoding one of three AKT/protein kinase B molecules), leading to a non-synonymous amino acid substitution in the highly conserved protein kinase domain. Previous knockout studies showed that Akt3 is pivotal in postnatal brain development, including a smaller brain, although seizures were not observed. In contrast to Akt3(Nmf350), we find that Akt3 null mice exhibit an elevated seizure threshold. An in vitro kinase assay revealed that Akt3(Nmf350) confers higher enzymatic activity, suggesting that Akt3(Nmf350) might enhance AKT signaling in the brain. In the dentate gyrus of Akt3(Nmf350) homozygotes, we also observed a modest increase in immunoreactivity of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6, an AKT pathway downstream target. Together these findings suggest that Akt3(Nmf350) confers an increase of AKT3 activity in specific neuronal populations in the brain, and a unique dominant phenotype. Akt3(Nmf350) mice provide a new tool for studying physiological roles of AKT signaling in the brain, and potentially novel mechanisms for epilepsy.",

        "Title": "Neuronal voltage-gated ion channels are genetic modifiers of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus.",
        "Abstract": "Mutations in the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel genes SCN1A and SCN2A are associated with inherited epilepsies, including genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy). The clinical presentation and severity of these epilepsies vary widely, even in people with the same mutation, suggesting the action of environmental or genetic modifiers. To gain support for the hypothesis that genetic modifiers can influence clinical presentation in patients with SCN1A-derived GEFS+, we used mouse models to study the effect of combining the human GEFS+ mutation SCN1A-R1648H with SCN2A, KCNQ2, and SCN8A mutations. Knock-in mice heterozygous for the R1648H mutation (Scn1a(RH/+)) have decreased thresholds to induced seizures and infrequent spontaneous seizures, whereas homozygotes display spontaneous seizures and premature lethality. Scn2a(Q54) transgenic mice have a mutation in Scn2a that results in spontaneous, adult-onset partial motor seizures, and mice carrying the Kcnq2-V182M mutation exhibit increased susceptibility to induced seizures, and rare spontaneous seizures as adults. Combining the Scn1a-R1648H allele with either Scn2a(Q54) or Kcnq2(V182M/+) results in early-onset, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and juvenile lethality in double heterozygous mice. In contrast, Scn8a mutants exhibit increased resistance to induced seizures. Combining the Scn1a-R1648H and Scn8a-med-jo alleles restores normal thresholds to flurothyl-induced seizures in Scn1a(RH/+) heterozygotes and improved survival of Scn1a(RH/RH) homozygotes. Our results demonstrate that variants in Scn2a, Kcnq2, and Scn8a can dramatically influence the phenotype of mice carrying the Scn1a-R1648H mutation and suggest that ion channel variants may contribute to the clinical variation seen in patients with monogenic epilepsy.",

        "Abstract": "Dynamin-1 (Dnm1) encodes a large multimeric GTPase necessary for activity-dependent membrane recycling in neurons, including synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Mice heterozygous for a novel spontaneous Dnm1 mutation--fitful--experience recurrent seizures, and homozygotes have more debilitating, often lethal seizures in addition to severe ataxia and neurosensory deficits. Fitful is a missense mutation in an exon that defines the DNM1a isoform, leaving intact the alternatively spliced exon that encodes DNM1b. The expression of the corresponding alternate transcripts is developmentally regulated, with DNM1b expression highest during early neuronal development and DNM1a expression increasing postnatally with synaptic maturation. Mutant DNM1a does not efficiently self-assemble into higher order complexes known to be necessary for proper dynamin function, and it also interferes with endocytic recycling in cell culture. In mice, the mutation results in defective synaptic transmission characterized by a slower recovery from depression after trains of stimulation. The DNM1a and DNM1b isoform pair is highly conserved in vertebrate evolution, whereas invertebrates have only one isoform. We speculate that the emergence of more specialized forms of DNM1 may be important in organisms with complex neuronal function.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, approximately 20 genetic variants are known to cause Mendelian forms of human epilepsy, leaving a vast heritability undefined. Rodent models for genetically complex epilepsy have been studied for many years, but only recently have strong candidate genes emerged, including Cacna1 g in the GAERS rat model of absence epilepsy and Kcnj10 in the low seizure threshold of DBA/2 mice. In parallel, a growing number of mouse mutations studied on multiple strain backgrounds reveal the impact of genetic modifiers on seizure severity, incidence or form--perhaps mimicking the complexity seen in humans. The field of experimental genetics in rodents is poised to study discrete epilepsy mutations on a diverse choice of strain backgrounds to develop better models and identify modifiers. But, it must find the right balance between embracing the strain diversity available, with the ability to detect and characterize genetic effects. Using alternative strain backgrounds when studying epilepsy mutations will enhance the modeling of epilepsy as a complex genetic disease.",

        "Abstract": "Absence epilepsy, characterized by spike-wave discharges (SWD) in the electroencephalogram, arises from aberrations within the circuitry of the cerebral cortex and thalamus that regulates awareness. The inbred mouse strain C3H/HeJ is prone to absence seizures, with a major susceptibility locus, spkw1, accounting for most of the phenotype. Here we find that spkw1 is associated with a hypomorphic retroviral-like insertion mutation in the Gria4 gene, encoding one of the four amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits in the brain. Consistent with this, Gria4 knockout mice also have frequent SWD and do not complement spkw1. In contrast, null mutants for the related gene Gria3 do not have SWD, and Gria3 loss actually lowers SWD of spkw1 homozygotes. Gria3 and Gria4 encode the predominant AMPA receptor subunits in the reticular thalamus, which is thought to play a central role in seizure genesis by inhibiting thalamic relay cells and promoting rebound burst firing responses. In Gria4 mutants, synaptic excitation of inhibitory reticular thalamic neurons is enhanced, with increased duration of synaptic responses-consistent with what might be expected from reduction of the kinetically faster subunit of AMPA receptors encoded by Gria4. These results demonstrate for the first time an essential role for Gria4 in the brain, and suggest that abnormal AMPA receptor-dependent synaptic activity can be involved in the network hypersynchrony that underlies absence seizures.",

        "Abstract": "Idiopathic epilepsy is a common human disorder with a strong genetic component, usually exhibiting complex inheritance. We describe a new mouse mutation in C57BL/6J mice, called frequent-flyer (Ff), in which disruption of the gene encoding RNA-binding protein Bruno-like 4 (Brunol4) leads to limbic and severe tonic-clonic seizures in heterozygous mutants beginning in their third month. Younger heterozygous adults have a reduced seizure threshold. Although homozygotes do not survive well on the C57BL/6J background, on mixed backgrounds homozygotes and some heterozygotes also display spike-wave discharges, the electroencephalographic manifestation of absence epilepsy. Brunol4 is widely expressed in the brain with enrichment in the hippocampus. Gene expression profiling and subsequent analysis revealed the down-regulation of at least four RNA molecules encoding proteins known to be involved in neuroexcitability, particularly in mutant hippocampus. Genetic and phenotypic assessment suggests that Brunol4 deficiency in mice results in a complex seizure phenotype, likely due to the coordinate dysregulation of several molecules, providing a unique new animal model of epilepsy that mimics the complex genetic architecture of common disease.",

        "Abstract": "The gene defective in fidget mice encodes fidgetin, a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase A anchoring protein 95 kDa (AKAP95) as a potential fidgetin-binding protein. Epitope-tagged fidgetin co-localized with endogenous AKAP95 in the nuclear matrix, and the physical interaction between fidgetin and AKAP95 was further confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation. To evaluate the biological significance of the fidgetin-AKAP95 binding, we created AKAP95 mutant mice through a gene trap strategy. Akap95 mutant mice are surprisingly viable with no overt phenotype. However, a significant number of mice carrying both Akap95 and fidget mutations die soon after birth due to cleft palate, consistent with the overlapping expression of AKAP95 and fidgetin in the branchial arches during mouse embryogenesis. These results expand the spectrum of the pleiotropic phenotypes of fidget mice and provide new leads on the in vivo function of AKAP95.",

        "Abstract": "The M-type K+ current [IK(M)] activates in response to membrane depolarization and regulates neuronal excitability. Mutations in two subunits (KCNQ2 and KCNQ3; Kv7.2 and Kv7.3) that underlie the M-channel cause the human seizure disorder benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC), presumably by reducing IK(M) function. In mice, the Szt1 mutation, which deletes the genomic DNA encoding the KCNQ2 C terminus and all of CHRNA4 (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 subunit) and ARFGAP-1 (GTPase-activating protein that inactivates ADP-ribosylation factor 1), reduces seizure threshold, and alters M-channel pharmacosensitivity. Genomic deletions affecting the C terminus of KCNQ2 have been identified in human families with BFNC, and truncation of the C terminus prevents proper KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channel assembly in Xenopus oocytes. We showed previously that Szt1 mice have a reduced baseline seizure threshold and altered sensitivity to drugs that act at the M-channel. Specifically, the proconvulsant M-channel blocker linopirdine and anticonvulsant enhancer retigabine display increased and decreased potency, respectively, in Szt1 mice. To investigate the effects of the Szt1 mutation on IK(M) function explicitly, perforated-patch electrophysiology was performed in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in brain slices prepared from C57BL/6J-Szt1/+ and control C57BL/6J+/+ mice. Our results show that Szt1 reduces both IK(M) amplitude and current density, inhibits spike frequency adaptation, and alters many aspects of M-channel pharmacology. This is the first evidence that a naturally occurring Kcnq2 mutation diminishes the amplitude and function of the native neuronal IK(M), resulting in significantly increased neuronal excitability. Finally, the changes in single-cell biophysical properties likely underlie the altered seizure threshold and pharmacosensitivity reported previously in Szt1 mice.",

        "Title": "Severe epilepsy resulting from genetic interaction between Scn2a and Kcnq2.",
        "Abstract": "A mutation in the voltage-gated sodium-channel Scn2a results in moderate epilepsy in transgenic Scn2a(Q54) mice maintained on a C57BL/6J strain background. The onset of progressive epilepsy begins in adults with short-duration partial seizures that originate in the hippocampus. The underlying abnormality is an increase in persistent sodium current in hippocampal neurons. The voltage-gated potassium channel Kcnq2 is responsible for generating M current (I(KM)) that is thought to control excitability and limit repetitive firing of hippocampal neurons. To determine whether impaired M current would exacerbate the seizure phenotype of Scn2a(Q54) mice, we carried out genetic crosses with two mutant alleles of Kcnq2. Szt1 mice carry a spontaneous deletion that removes the C-terminal domain of Kcnq2. A novel Kcnq2 missense mutation V182M was identified by screening the offspring of ENU-treated males for reduced threshold to electrically evoked minimal clonic seizures. Double mutant mice carrying the Scn2a(Q54) transgene together with either of the Kcnq2 mutations exhibited severe epilepsy with early onset, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and juvenile lethality by 3 weeks of age. This dramatic exacerbation of the sodium-channel mutant phenotype indicates that M current plays a critical role in preventing seizure initiation and spreading in this animal model. The genetic interaction between Scn2a and Kcnq2 demonstrates that combinations of mild alleles of monogenic epilepsy genes can result in severe disease and provides a model for complex inheritance of human epilepsy. The data suggest that interaction between these genes might contribute to the variable expressivity observed in human families with sodium-channel mutations. In a screen of 23 SMEI patients with missense mutations of SCN1A, no second-site mutations in KCNQ2 were identified.",

        "Abstract": "To characterize the genetic basis of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) detected by electroencephalography (EEG) in C3H/He mice, substrains of C3H mice were evaluated by EEG and sensitivity to ethosuximide. Crosses with the SWD-negative strain C57BL/6J were performed to map the underlying gene(s). C3H/He substrains exhibited a modest incidence (average of 19 SWDs per hour) of 7-8 Hz SWDs when at rest, compared with the C3HeB/Fe subline (four SWDs per hour). In the mapping backcross, however, many mice showed a very high incidence (50-220 SWDs per hour) throughout the recording period. SWDs were first detected at 3.5 weeks of age, were associated with behavioral arrest, were suppressed by ethosuximide, and were strongest in the cerebral cortex and thalamus. The major C3H determinant of SWDs, spkw1 (spike-wave 1), mapped to chromosome (Chr 9), and together with a C57BL/6J determinant on Chr 8, spkw2, accounted for more than one-half of the phenotypic variation in the backcross mice. The modest SWD incidence in C3H/He mice and the high incidence in backcrosses implies that SWD could be a confounding variable for other behaviors. Because C3H/He mice have no other brain abnormalities, they are an attractive alternative for studying idiopathic absence epilepsy.",

        "Title": "Functional characterization of fidgetin, an AAA-family protein mutated in fidget mice.",
        "Abstract": "The mouse fidget mutation is an autosomal recessive mutation that renders reduced or absent semicircular canals, microphthalmia, and various skeletal abnormalities to affected mice. We previously identified the defective gene which encodes fidgetin, a new member of the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA proteins). Here, we report on the subcellular localization of fidgetin as well as that of two closely related proteins, fidgetin-like 1 and fidgetin-like 2. Epitope-tagging and immunostaining revealed that both fidgetin and fidgetin-like 2 were predominantly localized to the nucleus, whereas fidgetin-like 1 was both nuclear and cytoplasmic. Furthermore, deletion studies identified a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal in the middle portion of the fidgetin protein. Since AAA proteins are known to form functional hetero- or homo-hexamers, we used reciprocal immunoprecipitation to examine the potential interaction among these proteins. We found that fidgetin interacted with itself and this specific interaction was abolished when either the N- or C-terminus of the protein was truncated. Taken together, our results suggest that fidgetin is a nuclear AAA-family protein with the potential to form homo-oligomers, thus representing the first step towards the elucidation of fidgetin's cellular function and the disease mechanism in fidget mutant mice.",

        "Abstract": "The voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma4 subunit protein, CACNG4, is closely related to the gamma2 subunit, CACNG2. Both are expressed primarily in the brain and share 53% amino acid identity. The Cacng2 gene is disrupted in the stargazer mouse, with its distinctive phenotype including ataxia, frequent absence seizure episodes, and head elevation. A disruption within Cacng4 was engineered to assess its particular function. The homozygous Cacng4-targeted mutant mouse appeared normal with no ataxic gait or absence seizures, suggesting that other members of the gamma subunit family might functionally compensate for the absence of CACNG4. To test this hypothesis, the targeted Cacng4 mutation was combined with alleles of Cacng2. Absence seizures were observed in combination with the stargazer 3J mutation, which itself does not have seizures, and increased seizure activity was observed in combination with the waggler allele. Furthermore, within the corticothalamic loop, where absence seizures arise, CACNG4 expression is restricted to the thalamus. Our studies show that the CACNG4 protein has seizure suppressing activity, but this effect is revealed only when CACNG2 expression is also compromised, suggesting that CACNG subunits have in vivo overlapping functions.",

The efforts of three NIH Mutagenesis Centers established for the detection of neuroscience-related phenotypes are described. Each center has developed an extensive panel of phenotype screens that assess nervous system structure and function. In particular, these screens focus on complex behavioral traits from drug and alcohol responses to circadian rhythms to epilepsy. Each of these centers has developed a bioinformatics infrastructure to track the extensive number of transactions that are inherent in these large-scale projects. Over 100 new mouse mutant lines have been defined through the efforts of these three mutagenesis centers and are presented to the research community via the centralized Web presence of the Neuromice.org consortium (http://www.neuromice.org). This community resource provides visitors with the ability to search for specific mutant phenotypes, to view the genetic and phenotypic details of mutant mouse lines, and to order these mice for use in their own research program.",

        "Title": "Genetic approaches to studying mouse models of human seizure disorders.",
        "Abstract": "In conclusion, we have discussed a reverse genetics approach to studying seizure disorders in mice (Fig. 1), employing a targeted mutagenesis method to exploit the genetic defects identified in human epilepsy families. After detailed characterization of the nature of the human mutation and the mouse counterpart gene, a targeting vector containing the human disease allele is created. The endogenous mouse gene is replaced by the human disease allele through homologous recombination in ES cells, leading to the generation of chimeric animals. Mice carrying one copy or both copies of the human mutation can be bred to study the phenotypic effect of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. At this stage, one may want to split the newly created mice into two groups. One group will go through seizure phenotyping tests, while the other group will be used to generate disease allele-carrying mice on a different genetic background. Phenotypic characterization of mice on different inbred strains includes behavioral monitoring and EEG analysis looking for the occurrence of spontaneous seizures, as well as routine cage examination looking for handling-provoked seizure and ECT- and PTZ- induced seizure paradigms looking for sensitivity to these stimuli. A complete evaluation of the seizure phenotype at the whole-animal level establishes the relevance of the mouse model to the human condition. Further investigation including imaging, electrophysiology and AED response in these mouse models will shed light on the mechanistic basis of the convulsive disorder. Current epilepsy research in mouse genetics offers promise for understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie epileptogenesis in humans. A large-scale forward genetic effort to create novel mouse mutants with seizure phenotypes by in vivo chemical mutagenesis with ethyl-nitroso urea (ENU) is underway at the Jackson Laboratory (http://www.jax.org/nmf/). Genetic mapping and isolation of the affected genes in these seizure-prone models will provide additional molecular pathways involved in seizures. The mutant mice generated through both forward and reverse genetic approaches will be a valuable resource for the biomedical community to study epilepsy at the molecular level and to characterize the pathological consequences of seizures in the whole organism.",

Failure to complement a mutant allele of a positional candidate gene, Scn8a, demonstrated that the mutations are new alleles of Scn8a. Missense mutations of evolutionarily conserved residues of the sodium channel were identified in the three lines, with the predicted amino acid substitutions N1370T, I1392F, and L1404H. These residues are located within the pore loop of domain 3 of sodium channel Na(v)1.6. The lethal phenotypes suggest that the new alleles encode proteins with partial or complete loss of function. Several human disorders are caused by mutation in the pore loop of domain 3 of paralogous sodium channel genes. Line nmf5 contains a second, independent mutation in the rd13 locus that causes a reduction in cell number in the outer nuclear layer of the retina. rd13 was mapped to the distal 4 Mb of Chr 15. No coding or splice site mutations were detected in Pde1b, a candidate gene for rd13. The generation of three independent Scn8a mutations among 1100 tested G3 families demonstrates that the Scn8a locus is highly susceptible to ENU mutagenesis. The new alleles of Scn8a will be valuable for analysis of sodium channel physiology and disease.",

        "Abstract": "The study of genetic variation in mice offers a powerful experimental platform for understanding gene function. Complex trait analysis, gene-targeting and gene-trapping technologies, as well as insertional and chemical mutagenesis approaches are becoming increasingly sophisticated and provide a variety of options for cataloguing gene activities and interactions. In this review we discuss fundamental and practical concepts related to chemical mutagenesis and we highlight the growing list of strategies for performing mutagenesis screens in mice. Gene-driven and diverse types of phenotype-driven screens provide several options for the recovery of the invaluable variety of alleles generated by chemical mutagenesis. The unique advantages offered using chemical mutagenesis compare favourably to and complement the spectrum of approaches available for functional annotation of the mammalian genome.",

        "Abstract": "The stargazer mutant mouse is characterized by its ataxic gait, head tossing, and absence seizures. The mutation was identified in the gamma 2 subunit gene of the high voltage-dependent calcium channel, Cacng2. Subsequently, two allelic variants of stargazer have arisen, waggler and stargazer 3J. In this study, we have compared these new alleles to the original stargazer allele. All three mutations affect the Cacng2 mRNA levels as they all arise from disruptions within the introns of this gene. Our results show that the mutations cause reduced Cacng2 mRNA and protein levels. Stargazer and waggler mice have the least amount of mRNA and undetectable protein, whereas stargazer 3J appears to be the mildest allele, both in terms of the phenotype and protein expression. Electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis confirmed that stargazer has frequent spike-wave discharges (SWDs); the average duration of each discharge burst is 5 seconds and recurs every minute. The waggler allele causes a greater variation in SWD activity depending on the individual mouse, and the stargazer 3J mouse has no SWDs. The preliminary characterization of this heterogeneous allelic series provides a basis to explore more biochemical and physiological parameters relating to the role of the Cacng2 product in calcium channel activity, AMPA receptor localization, and cerebellar disturbances.",

        "Abstract": "The electroconvulsive threshold (ECT) test has been used extensively to determine the protection conferred by antiepileptic drug candidates against induced seizures in rodents. Despite its clinical relevance, the potential of ECT to identify mouse epilepsy models in genetic studies has not been thoroughly assessed. We adopted the ECT test to screen the progeny of ethylnitrosourea treated male C57BL/6J mice. In a small-scale screen, several mutant lines conferring a low threshold to ECT minimal clonic seizures were mapped to the telomeric region of mouse chromosome 2 in independent founder families. This high incidence was suggestive of a single spontaneous event that pre-existed in the founders of mutagenized stock. Genetic and physical mapping led to the discovery that several lines shared a single mutation, Szt1 (seizure threshold-1), consisting of a 300 kb deletion of genomic DNA involving three known genes. Two of these genes, Kcnq2 and Chrna4, are known to be mutated in human epilepsy families. Szt1 homozygotes and heterozygotes display similar phenotypes to those found in the respective Kcnq2 knockout mutant mice, suggesting that Kcnq2 haploinsufficiency is at the root of the Szt1 seizure sensitivity. Our results provide a novel genetic model for epilepsy research and demonstrate that the approach of using ECT to study seizures in mice has the potential to lead to the identification of human epilepsy susceptibility genes.",
