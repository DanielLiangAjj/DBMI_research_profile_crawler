        "Abstract": "Chronic stress and elevated levels of glucocorticoids (GCs), the main stress hormones, accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and progression. A major driver of AD progression is the spreading of pathogenic Tau protein between brain regions, precipitated by neuronal Tau secretion. While stress and high GC levels are known to induce intraneuronal Tau pathology (i.e. hyperphosphorylation, oligomerization) in animal models, their role in trans-neuronal Tau spreading is unexplored. Here, we find that GCs promote secretion of full-length, primarily vesicle-free, phosphorylated Tau from murine hippocampal neurons and ex vivo brain slices. This process requires neuronal activity and the kinase GSK3β. GCs also dramatically enhance trans-neuronal Tau spreading in vivo, and this effect is blocked by an inhibitor of Tau oligomerization and type 1 unconventional protein secretion. These findings uncover a potential mechanism by which stress/GCs stimulate Tau propagation in AD.",

        "Abstract": "Prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids, the main stress hormones, damages the brain and is a risk factor for depression and Alzheimer's disease. Two major drivers of glucocorticoid-related neurotoxicity are mitochondrial dysfunction and Tau pathology; however, the molecular/cellular mechanisms precipitating these events, and their causal relationship, remain unclear. Using cultured murine hippocampal neurons and 4-5-month-old mice treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, we investigate the mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid-induced mitochondrial damage and Tau pathology. We find that glucocorticoids stimulate opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore via transcriptional upregulation of its activating component, cyclophilin D. Inhibition of cyclophilin D is protective against glucocorticoid-induced mitochondrial damage as well as Tau phosphorylation and oligomerization in cultured neurons. We further identify the mitochondrially-targeted compound mito-apocynin as an inhibitor of glucocorticoid-induced permeability transition pore opening, and show that this compound protects against mitochondrial dysfunction, Tau pathology, synaptic loss, and behavioural deficits induced by glucocorticoids in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that mito-apocynin and the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone rescue Tau pathology in cytoplasmic hybrid cells, an ex vivo Alzheimer's disease model wherein endogenous mitochondria are replaced with mitochondria from Alzheimer's subjects. These findings show that mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening is a precipitating factor in glucocorticoid-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and that this event stimulates Tau pathogenesis. Our data also link glucocorticoids to mitochondrial dysfunction and Tau pathology in the context of Alzheimer's disease and suggest that mitochondria are promising therapeutic targets for mitigating stress- and Tau-related brain damage.",

        "Abstract": "Turnover of synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins is vital for the maintenance of healthy and functional synapses. SV protein turnover is driven by neuronal activity in an endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent manner. Here, we characterize a critical step in this process: axonal transport of ESCRT-0 component Hrs, necessary for sorting proteins into the ESCRT pathway and recruiting downstream ESCRT machinery to catalyze multivesicular body (MVB) formation. We find that neuronal activity stimulates the formation of presynaptic endosomes and MVBs, as well as the motility of Hrs+ vesicles in axons and their delivery to SV pools. Hrs+ vesicles co-transport ESCRT-0 component STAM1 and comprise a subset of Rab5+ vesicles, likely representing pro-degradative early endosomes. Furthermore, we identify kinesin motor protein KIF13A as essential for the activity-dependent transport of Hrs to SV pools and the degradation of SV membrane proteins. Together, these data demonstrate a novel activity- and KIF13A-dependent mechanism for mobilizing axonal transport of ESCRT machinery to facilitate the degradation of SV membrane proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic stress and elevated glucocorticoids (GCs), the major stress hormones, are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and promote AD pathomechanisms, including overproduction of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. The latter is linked to downregulation of the small GTPase Rab35, which mediates Tau degradation via the endolysosomal pathway. Whether Rab35 is also involved in Aβ overproduction remains an open question. Here, we find that hippocampal Rab35 levels are decreased not only by stress/GC but also by aging, another AD risk factor. Moreover, we show that Rab35 negatively regulates Aβ production by sorting amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase (BACE1) out of the endosomal network, where they interact to produce Aβ. Interestingly, Rab35 coordinates distinct intracellular trafficking steps for BACE1 and APP, mediated by its effectors OCRL and ACAP2, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that Rab35 overexpression prevents the amyloidogenic trafficking of APP and BACE1 induced by high GC levels. These studies identify Rab35 as a key regulator of APP processing and suggest that its downregulation may contribute to stress-related and AD-related amyloidogenesis.",

Over the past few decades, a great deal has been learned about the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton in axonal and dendritic transport, with a broad impact on neuronal health and disease. However, significantly less attention has been paid to the importance of microtubule dynamics in directly regulating synaptic function. Here, we review emerging literature demonstrating that microtubules enter synapses and control central aspects of synaptic activity, including neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. The pleiotropic effects caused by a dysfunctional synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton may thus represent a key point of vulnerability for neurons and a primary driver of neurological disease.",

        "Abstract": "Emerging studies implicate Tau as an essential mediator of neuronal atrophy and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the factors that precipitate Tau dysfunction in AD are poorly understood. Chronic environmental stress and elevated glucocorticoids (GC), the major stress hormones, are associated with increased risk of AD and have been shown to trigger intracellular Tau accumulation and downstream Tau-dependent neuronal dysfunction. However, the mechanisms through which stress and GC disrupt Tau clearance and degradation in neurons remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Tau undergoes degradation via endolysosomal sorting in a pathway requiring the small GTPase Rab35 and the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. Furthermore, we find that GC impair Tau degradation by decreasing Rab35 levels, and that AAV-mediated expression of Rab35 in the hippocampus rescues GC-induced Tau accumulation and related neurostructural deficits. These studies indicate that the Rab35/ESCRT pathway is essential for Tau clearance and part of the mechanism through which GC precipitate brain pathology.",

        "Abstract": "As the sites of communication between neurons, synapses depend upon precisely regulated protein-protein interactions to support neurotransmitter release and reception. Moreover, neuronal synapses typically exist great distances (i.e. up to meters) away from cell bodies, which are the sources of new proteins and the major sites of protein degradation via lysosomes. Thus, synapses are uniquely sensitive to disruptions in proteostasis, and depend upon carefully orchestrated degradative mechanisms for the clearance of dysfunctional proteins. One of the primary cellular degradative pathways is macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as 'autophagy'. Although it has only recently become a focus of research in synaptic biology, emerging studies indicate that autophagy has essential functions at the synapse throughout an organism's lifetime. This review will discuss recent findings about the roles of synaptic autophagy, as well as some of the questions and issues to be considered in this field moving forward.",

        "Abstract": "Few tools are available for noninvasive imaging of synapses in the living mammalian brain. Current paradigms require the use of genetically modified mice or viral delivery of genetic material to the brain. To develop an alternative chemical approach, utilizing the recognition of synaptic components by organic small molecules, we designed an imaging-based, high-content screen in cultured cortical neurons to identify molecules based on their colocalization with fluorescently tagged synaptic proteins. We used this approach to screen a library of ∼7000 novel fluorescent dyes, and identified a series of compounds in the xanthone family that exhibited consistent synaptic labeling. Follow-up studies with one of these compounds, CX-G3, demonstrated its ability to label acidic organelles and in particular synaptic vesicles at glutamatergic synapses in cultured neurons and murine brain tissue, indicating the potential of this screening approach to identify promising lead compounds for use as synaptic markers, sensors, and targeting devices.",

        "Abstract": "Rab35 and the Rab35 network of GAPs, GEFs, and effectors are important regulators of membrane trafficking for a variety of cellular processes, from cytokinesis and phagocytosis to neurite outgrowth. In the past five years, components of this signaling network have also been implicated as critical mediators of synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling and protein homeostasis. Recent studies by several groups, including our own, have demonstrated that Rab35-mediated endosomal sorting is required for the degradation of SV proteins via the ESCRT pathway, thereby eliminating old or damaged proteins from the SV pool. This sorting process is regulated by Rab35 activation in response to neuronal activity, and potentially by an antagonistic signaling relationship between Rab35 and the small GTPase Arf6 that directs SVs into distinct recycling pathways depending on neuronal activity levels. Furthermore, mutations in genes encoding Rab35 regulatory proteins are emerging as causative factors in human neurologic and neurodegenerative diseases, consistent with their important roles in synaptic and neuronal health. Here, we review these recent findings and offer our perspective on how the Rab35 signaling network functions to maintain neurotransmission and synaptic fitness.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, lead to juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease by inducing the selective death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Accumulating evidence indicates that Parkin also has an important role in excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission, although its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we investigate Parkin's role at glutamatergic synapses of rat hippocampal neurons. We find that Parkin-deficient neurons exhibit significantly reduced AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated currents and cell-surface expression, and that these phenotypes result from decreased postsynaptic expression of the adaptor protein Homer1, which is necessary for coupling AMPAR endocytic zones with the postsynaptic density. Accordingly, Parkin loss of function leads to the reduced density of postsynaptic endocytic zones and to impaired AMPAR internalization. These findings demonstrate a novel and essential role for Parkin in glutamatergic neurotransmission, as a stabilizer of postsynaptic Homer1 and the Homer1-linked endocytic machinery necessary for maintaining normal cell-surface AMPAR levels.",

        "Abstract": "Synaptic vesicle (SV) pools must maintain a functional repertoire of proteins to efficiently release neurotransmitter. The accumulation of old or damaged proteins on SV membranes is linked to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. However, despite the importance of SV protein turnover for neuronal health, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are largely unknown. Here, we have used dissociated rat hippocampal neurons to investigate the pathway for SV protein degradation. We find that neuronal activity drives the degradation of a subset of SV proteins and that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and SV-associated GTPase Rab35 are key elements of this use-dependent degradative pathway. Specifically, neuronal activity induces Rab35 activation and binding to the ESCRT-0 protein Hrs, which we have identified as a novel Rab35 effector. These actions recruit the downstream ESCRT machinery to SV pools, thereby initiating SV protein degradation via the ESCRT pathway. Our findings show that the Rab35/ESCRT pathway facilitates the activity-dependent removal of specific proteins from SV pools, thereby maintaining presynaptic protein homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "The regulated release of neurotransmitter occurs via the fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at specialized regions of the presynaptic membrane called active zones (AZs). These regions are defined by a cytoskeletal matrix assembled at AZs (CAZ), which functions to direct SVs toward docking and fusion sites and supports their maturation into the readily releasable pool. In addition, CAZ proteins localize voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels at SV release sites, bringing the fusion machinery in close proximity to the calcium source. Proteins of the CAZ therefore ensure that vesicle fusion is temporally and spatially organized, allowing for the precise and reliable release of neurotransmitter. Importantly, AZs are highly dynamic structures, supporting presynaptic remodeling, changes in neurotransmitter release efficacy, and thus presynaptic forms of plasticity. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the study of active zones, highlighting how the CAZ molecularly defines sites of neurotransmitter release, endocytic zones, and the integrity of synapses.",

        "Abstract": "The dynamic assembly of filamentous (F) actin plays essential roles in the assembly of presynaptic boutons, the fusion, mobilization and recycling of synaptic vesicles (SVs), and presynaptic forms of plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the temporal and spatial assembly of presynaptic F-actin remain largely unknown. Similar to other F-actin rich membrane specializations, presynaptic boutons contain a set of molecules that respond to cellular cues and trans-synaptic signals to facilitate activity-dependent assembly of F-actin. The presynaptic active zone (AZ) protein Piccolo has recently been identified as a key regulator of neurotransmitter release during SV cycling. It does so by coordinating the activity-dependent assembly of F-Actin and the dynamics of key plasticity molecules including Synapsin1, Profilin and CaMKII. The multidomain structure of Piccolo, its exquisite association with the AZ, and its ability to interact with a number of actin-associated proteins suggest that Piccolo may function as a platform to coordinate the spatial assembly of F-actin. Here we have identified Daam1, a Formin that functions with Profilin to drive F-actin assembly, as a novel Piccolo binding partner. We also found that within cells Daam1 activation promotes Piccolo binding, an interaction that can spatially direct the polymerization of F-Actin. Moreover, similar to Piccolo and Profilin, Daam1 loss of function impairs presynaptic-F-actin assembly in neurons. These data suggest a model in which Piccolo directs the assembly of presynaptic F-Actin from the AZ by scaffolding key actin regulatory proteins including Daam1.",

        "Abstract": "The presynaptic active zone (AZ) is a specialized microdomain designed for the efficient and repetitive release of neurotransmitter. Bassoon and Piccolo are two high molecular weight components of the AZ, with hypothesized roles in its assembly and structural maintenance. However, glutamatergic synapses lacking either protein exhibit relatively minor defects, presumably due to their significant functional redundancy. In the present study, we have used interference RNAs to eliminate both proteins from glutamatergic synapses, and find that they are essential for maintaining synaptic integrity. Loss of Bassoon and Piccolo leads to the aberrant degradation of multiple presynaptic proteins, culminating in synapse degeneration. This phenotype is mediated in part by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah1, an interacting partner of Bassoon and Piccolo whose activity is negatively regulated by their conserved zinc finger domains. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for Bassoon and Piccolo as critical regulators of presynaptic ubiquitination and proteostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Filamentous (F)-actin is a known regulator of the synaptic vesicle (SV) cycle, with roles in SV mobilization, fusion, and endocytosis. However, the molecular pathways that regulate its dynamic assembly within presynaptic boutons remain unclear. In this study, we have used shRNA-mediated knockdown to demonstrate that Piccolo, a multidomain protein of the active zone cytomatrix, is a key regulator of presynaptic F-actin assembly. Boutons lacking Piccolo exhibit enhanced activity-dependent Synapsin1a dispersion and SV exocytosis, and reduced F-actin polymerization and CaMKII recruitment. These phenotypes are rescued by stabilizing F-actin filaments and mimicked by knocking down Profilin2, another regulator of presynaptic F-actin assembly. Importantly, we find that mice with a targeted deletion of exon 14 from the Pclo gene, reported to lack >95% of Piccolo, continue to express multiple Piccolo isoforms. Furthermore, neurons cultured from these mice exhibit no defects in presynaptic F-actin assembly due to the expression of these isoforms at presynaptic boutons. These data reveal that Piccolo regulates neurotransmitter release by facilitating activity-dependent F-actin assembly and the dynamic recruitment of key signaling molecules into presynaptic boutons, and highlight the need for new genetic models with which to study Piccolo loss of function.",

        "Title": "SAP97 directs NMDA receptor spine targeting and synaptic plasticity.",
        "Abstract": "SAP97 is a multidomain scaffold protein implicated in the forward trafficking and synaptic localization of NMDA- and AMPA-type glutamate receptors. Alternative splicing of SAP97 transcripts gives rise to palmitoylated αSAP97 and L27-domain containing βSAP97 isoforms that differentially regulate the subsynaptic localization of GluR1 subunits of AMPA receptors. Here, we examined whether SAP97 isoforms regulate the mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) and find that both α- and β-forms of SAP97 impair LTP but enhance LTD via independent isoform-specific mechanisms. Live imaging of α- and βSAP97 revealed that the altered synaptic plasticity was not due to activity-dependent changes in SAP97 localization or exchange kinetics. However, by recording from pairs of synaptically coupled hippocampal neurons, we show that αSAP97 occludes LTP by enhancing the levels of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, while βSAP97 blocks LTP by reducing the synaptic localization of NMDA receptors. Examination of the surface pools of AMPA and NMDA receptors indicates that αSAP97 selectively regulates the synaptic pool of AMPA receptors, whereas βSAP97 regulates the extrasynaptic pools of both AMPA and NMDA receptors. Knockdown of βSAP97 increases the synaptic localization of both AMPA and NMDA receptors, showing that endogenous βSAP97 restricts glutamate receptor expression at excitatory synapses. This isoform-dependent differential regulation of synaptic versus extrasynaptic pools of glutamate receptors will determine how many receptors are available for the induction and the expression of synaptic plasticity. Our data support a model wherein SAP97 isoforms can regulate the ability of synapses to undergo plasticity by controlling the surface distribution of AMPA and NMDA receptors.",

Presynaptic compartments, or 'boutons', signal to the postsynaptic compartment by releasing chemical neurotransmitter in response to incoming electrical impulses. Recent studies link defects in the function of presynaptic boutons to the etiology of several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we describe five core functions of presynaptic boutons and the molecules that mediate these functions, focusing on a subset that are linked to human disease. We also discuss potential mechanisms through which the loss or alteration of these specific molecules could lead to defects in synaptic communication, neural circuit function and, ultimately, cognition and behavior.",

        "Abstract": "Synaptic plasticity is dependent on the differential sorting, delivery and retention of neurotransmitter receptors, but the mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood. We found that differential sorting of glutamate receptor subtypes began in the endoplasmic reticulum of rat hippocampal neurons. As AMPA receptors (AMPARs) were trafficked to the plasma membrane via the conventional somatic Golgi network, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) were diverted from the somatic endoplasmic reticulum into a specialized endoplasmic reticulum subcompartment that bypasses somatic Golgi, merging instead with dendritic Golgi outposts. This endoplasmic reticulum subcompartment was composed of highly mobile vesicles containing the NMDAR subunits NR1 and NR2B, the microtubule-dependent motor protein KIF17, and the postsynaptic adaptor proteins CASK and SAP97. Our data demonstrate that the retention and trafficking of NMDARs in this endoplasmic reticulum subcompartment requires both CASK and SAP97. These findings indicate that NMDARs are sorted away from AMPARs via a non-conventional secretory pathway that utilizes dendritic Golgi outposts.",

        "Abstract": "The synaptic insertion of GluR1-containing AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) is critical for synaptic plasticity. However, mechanisms responsible for GluR1 insertion and retention at the synapse are unclear. The synapse-associated protein SAP97 directly binds GluR1 and participates in its forward trafficking from the Golgi network to the plasma membrane. Whether SAP97 also plays a role in scaffolding GluR1 at the postsynaptic membrane is controversial, attributable to its expression as a collection of alternatively spliced isoforms with ill-defined spatial and temporal distributions. In the present study, we have used live imaging and electrophysiology to demonstrate that two postsynaptic, N-terminal isoforms of SAP97 directly modulate the levels, dynamics, and function of synaptic GluR1-containing AMPARs. Specifically, the unique N-terminal domains confer distinct subsynaptic localizations onto SAP97, targeting the palmitoylated alpha-isoform to the postsynaptic density (PSD) and the L27 domain-containing beta-isoform primarily to non-PSD, perisynaptic regions. Consequently, alpha- and betaSAP97 differentially influence the subsynaptic localization and dynamics of AMPARs by creating binding sites for GluR1-containing receptors within their respective subdomains. These results indicate that N-terminal splicing of SAP97 can control synaptic strength by regulating the distribution of AMPARs and, hence, their responsiveness to presynaptically released glutamate.",

        "Abstract": "Active zones are specialized regions of the presynaptic plasma membrane designed for the efficient and repetitive release of neurotransmitter via synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis. Piccolo is a high molecular weight component of the active zone that is hypothesized to participate both in active zone formation and the scaffolding of key molecules involved in SV recycling. In this study, we use interference RNAs to eliminate Piccolo expression from cultured hippocampal neurons to assess its involvement in synapse formation and function. Our data show that Piccolo is not required for glutamatergic synapse formation but does influence presynaptic function by negatively regulating SV exocytosis. Mechanistically, this regulation appears to be calmodulin kinase II-dependent and mediated through the modulation of Synapsin1a dynamics. This function is not shared by the highly homologous protein Bassoon, which indicates that Piccolo has a unique role in coupling the mobilization of SVs in the reserve pool to events within the active zone.",

        "Abstract": "Synapse development in the vertebrate central nervous system is a highly orchestrated process occurring not only during early stages of brain development, but also (to a lesser extent) in the mature nervous system. During development, the formation of synapses is intimately linked to the differentiation of neuronal cells, the extension of their axons and dendrites, and the course wiring of the nervous system. Subsequently, the stabilization, elimination, and strengthening of synaptic contacts is coupled to the refinement of axonal and dendritic arbors, to the establishment of functionally meaningful connections, and probably also to the day-to-day acquisition, storage, and retrieval of memories, higher order thought processes, and behavioral patterns.",

        "Title": "Transsynaptic signaling by postsynaptic synapse-associated protein 97.",
        "Abstract": "The molecular mechanisms by which postsynaptic modifications lead to precisely coordinated changes in presynaptic structure and function are primarily unknown. To address this issue, we examined the presynaptic consequences of postsynaptic expression of members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family of synaptic scaffolding proteins. Postsynaptic expression of synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) increased presynaptic protein content and active zone size to a greater extent than comparable amounts of postsynaptic PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95) or SAP102. In addition, postsynaptic expression of SAP97 enhanced presynaptic function, as measured by increased FM4-64 dye uptake. The structural presynaptic effects of postsynaptic SAP97 required ligand binding through two of its PDZ (PSD-95/Discs large/zona occludens-1) domains as well as intact N-terminal and guanylate kinase domains. Expression of SAP97 recruited a complex of additional postsynaptic proteins to synapses including glutamate receptor 1, Shank1a, SPAR (spine-associated RapGAP), and proSAP2. Furthermore, inhibition of several different transsynaptic signaling proteins including cadherins, integrins, and EphB receptor/ephrinB significantly reduced the presynaptic growth caused by postsynaptic SAP97. These results suggest that SAP97 may play a central role in the coordinated growth of synapses during development and plasticity by recruiting a complex of postsynaptic proteins that enhances presynaptic terminal growth and function via multiple transsynaptic molecular interactions.",

        "Abstract": "The release of monoamine neurotransmitters from cell bodies and dendrites has an important role in behavior, but the mechanism (vesicular or non vesicular) has remained unclear. Because the location of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) defines the secretory vesicles capable of monoamine release, we have studied its trafficking to assess the potential for monoamine release by exocytosis. In neuroendocrine PC12 cells, VMAT2 localizes exclusively to large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), and we now show that cytoplasmic signals target VMAT2 directly to LDCVs within the biosynthetic pathway. In neurons, VMAT2 localizes to a population of vesicles that we now find undergo regulated exocytosis in dendrites. Although hippocampal neurons do not express typical LDCV proteins, transfected chromogranins A, B, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) colocalize with VMAT2. VMAT2 thus defines a population of secretory vesicles that mediate the activity-dependent somatodendritic release of multiple retrograde signals involved in synaptic function, growth, and plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "The formation of synapses in the vertebrate central nervous system is a complex process that occurs over a protracted period of development. Recent work has begun to unravel the mysteries of synaptogenesis, demonstrating the existence of multiple molecules that influence not only when and where synapses form but also synaptic specificity and stability. Some of these molecules act at a distance, steering axons to their correct receptive fields and promoting neuronal differentiation and maturation, whereas others act at the time of contact, providing positional information about the appropriateness of targets and/or inductive signals that trigger the cascade of events leading to synapse formation. In addition, correlated synaptic activity provides critical information about the appropriateness of synaptic connections, thereby influencing synapse stability and elimination. Although synapse formation and elimination are hallmarks of early development, these processes are also fundamental to learning, memory, and cognition in the mature brain.",
