        "Abstract": "In albinism, aberrations in the ipsi-/contralateral retinal ganglion cell (RGC) ratio compromise the functional integrity of the binocular circuit. Here, we focus on the mouse ciliary margin zone (CMZ), a neurogenic niche at the embryonic peripheral retina, to investigate developmental processes regulating RGC neurogenesis and identity acquisition. We found that the mouse ventral CMZ generates predominantly ipsilaterally projecting RGCs, but this output is altered in the albino visual system because of CyclinD2 downregulation and disturbed timing of the cell cycle. Consequently, albino as well as CyclinD2-deficient pigmented mice exhibit diminished ipsilateral retinogeniculate projection and poor depth perception. In albino mice, pharmacological stimulation of calcium channels, known to upregulate CyclinD2 in other cell types, augmented CyclinD2-dependent neurogenesis of ipsilateral RGCs and improved stereopsis. Together, these results implicate CMZ neurogenesis and its regulators as critical for the formation and function of the mammalian binocular circuit.",

        "Title": "Spatiotemporal distribution of glia in and around the developing mouse optic tract.",
        "Abstract": "In the developing mouse optic tract, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon position is organized by topography and laterality (i.e., eye-specific or ipsi- and contralateral segregation). Our lab previously showed that ipsilaterally projecting RGCs are segregated to the lateral aspect of the developing optic tract and found that ipsilateral axons self-fasciculate to a greater extent than contralaterally projecting RGC axons in vitro. However, the full complement of axon-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors mediating eye-specific segregation in the tract remain poorly understood. Glia, which are known to express several guidance cues in the visual system and regulate the navigation of ipsilateral and contralateral RGC axons at the optic chiasm, are natural candidates for contributing to eye-specific pre-target axon organization. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal expression patterns of both putative astrocytes (Aldh1l1+ cells) and microglia (Iba1+ cells) in the embryonic and neonatal optic tract. We quantified the localization of ipsilateral RGC axons to the lateral two-thirds of the optic tract and analyzed glia position and distribution relative to eye-specific axon organization. While our results indicate that glial segregation patterns do not strictly align with eye-specific RGC axon segregation in the tract, we identify distinct spatiotemporal organization of both Aldh1l1+ cells and microglia in and around the developing optic tract. These findings inform future research into molecular mechanisms of glial involvement in RGC axon growth and organization in the developing retinogeniculate pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Prior to forming and refining synaptic connections, axons of projection neurons navigate long distances to their targets. While much is known about guidance cues for axon navigation through intermediate choice points, whether and how axons are organized within tracts is less clear. Here we analyze the organization of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the developing mouse retinogeniculate pathway. RGC axons are organized by both eye-specificity and topography in the optic nerve and tract: ipsilateral RGC axons are segregated from contralateral axons and are offset laterally in the tract relative to contralateral axon topographic position. To identify potential cell-autonomous factors contributing to the segregation of ipsilateral and contralateral RGC axons in the visual pathway, we assessed their fasciculation behavior in a retinal explant assay. Ipsilateral RGC neurites self-fasciculate more than contralateral neurites in vitro and maintain this difference in the presence of extrinsic chiasm cues. To further probe the role of axon self-association in circuit formation in vivo, we examined RGC axon organization and fasciculation in an EphB1",

        "Abstract": "Although much is known about the regenerative capacity of retinal ganglion cells, very significant barriers remain in our ability to restore visual function following traumatic injury or disease-induced degeneration. Here we summarize our current understanding of the factors regulating axon guidance and target engagement in regenerating axons, and review the state of the field of neural regeneration, focusing on the visual system and highlighting studies using other model systems that can inform analysis of visual system regeneration. This overview is motivated by a Society for Neuroscience Satellite meeting, \"Reconnecting Neurons in the Visual System,\" held in October 2015 sponsored by the National Eye Institute as part of their \"Audacious Goals Initiative\" and co-organized by Carol Mason (Columbia University) and Michael Crair (Yale University). The collective wisdom of the conference participants pointed to important gaps in our knowledge and barriers to progress in promoting the restoration of visual system function. This article is thus a summary of our existing understanding of visual system regeneration and provides a blueprint for future progress in the field.",

        "Title": "Transient ipsilateral retinal ganglion cell projections to the brain: Extent, targeting, and disappearance.",
        "Abstract": "During development of the mammalian eye, the first retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that extend to the brain are located in the dorsocentral (DC) retina. These RGCs extend to either ipsilateral or contralateral targets, but the ipsilateral projections do not survive into postnatal periods. The function and means of disappearance of the transient ipsilateral projection are not known. We have followed the course of this transient early ipsilateral cohort of RGCs, paying attention to how far they extend, whether they enter targets and if so, which ones, and the time course of their disappearance. The DC ipsilateral RGC axons were traced using DiI labeling at E13.5 and E15.5 to compare the proportion of ipsi- versus contralateral projections during the first period of growth. In utero electroporation of E12.5 retina with GFP constructs was used to label axons that could be visualized at succeeding time points into postnatal ages. Our results show that the earliest ipsilateral axons grow along the cellular border of the brain, and are segregated from the laterally positioned contralateral axons from the same retinal origin. In agreement with previous reports, although many early RGCs extend ipsilaterally, after E16 their number rapidly declines. Nonetheless, some ipsilateral axons from the DC retina enter the superior colliculus and arborize minimally, but very few enter the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and those that do extend only short branches. While the mechanism of selective axonal disappearance remains elusive, these data give further insight into establishment of the visual pathways.",

        "Title": "Eye-specific projections of retinogeniculate axons are altered in albino mice.",
        "Abstract": "The divergence of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons into ipsilateral and contralateral projections at the optic chiasm and the subsequent segregation of retinal inputs into eye-specific domains in their target, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), are crucial for binocular vision. In albinism, affected individuals exhibit a lack or reduction of pigmentation in the eye and skin, a concomitant reduced ipsilateral projection, and diverse visual defects. Here we investigate how such altered decussation affects eye-specific retinogeniculate targeting in albino mice using the C57BL/6 Tyr(c-2J/c-2J) strain, in which tyrosinase, necessary for melanogenesis, is mutated. In albino mice, fewer RGCs from the ventrotemporal (VT) retina project ipsilaterally, reflected in a decrease in cells expressing ipsilateral markers. In addition, a population of RGCs from the VT retina projects contralaterally and, within the dLGN, their axons cluster into a patch separated from the contralateral termination area. Furthermore, eye-specific segregation is not complete in the albino dLGN and, upon perturbing postnatal retinal activity with epibatidine, the ipsilateral projection fragments and the aberrant contralateral patch disappears. These results suggest that the defects in afferent targeting and activity-dependent refinement in the albino dLGN arise from RGC misspecification together with potential perturbations of early activity patterns in the albino retina.",

        "Abstract": "Partial decussation of sensory pathways allows neural inputs from both sides of the body to project to the same target region where these signals will be integrated. Here, to better understand mechanisms of eye-specific targeting, we studied how retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons terminate in their thalamic target, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), when crossing at the optic chiasm midline is altered. In models with gain- and loss-of-function of EphB1, the receptor that directs the ipsilateral projection at the optic chiasm, misrouted RGCs target the appropriate retinotopic zone in the opposite dLGN. However, in EphB1(-/-) mice, the misrouted axons do not intermingle with normally projecting RGC axons and segregate instead into a distinct patch. We also revisited the role of retinal activity on eye-specific targeting by blocking correlated waves of activity with epibatidine into both eyes. We show that, in wild-type mice, retinal waves are necessary during the first postnatal week for both proper distribution and eye-specific segregation of ipsilateral axons in the mature dLGN. Moreover, in EphB1(-/-) mice, refinement of ipsilateral axons is perturbed in control conditions and is further impaired after epibatidine treatment. Finally, retinal waves are required for the formation of the segregated patch of misrouted axons in EphB1(-/-) mice. These findings implicate molecular determinants for targeting of eye-specific zones that are independent of midline guidance cues and that function in concert with correlated retinal activity to sculpt retinogeniculate projections.",

        "Title": "In utero and ex vivo electroporation for gene expression in mouse retinal ganglion cells.",
        "Abstract": "The retina and its sole output neuron, the retinal ganglion cell (RGC), comprise an excellent model in which to examine biological questions such as cell differentiation, axon guidance, retinotopic organization and synapse formation. One drawback is the inability to efficiently and reliably manipulate gene expression in RGCs in vivo, especially in the otherwise accessible murine visual pathways. Transgenic mice can be used to manipulate gene expression, but this approach is often expensive, time consuming, and can produce unwanted side effects. In chick, in ovo electroporation is used to manipulate gene expression in RGCs for examining retina and RGC development. Although similar electroporation techniques have been developed in neonatal mouse pups, adult rats, and embryonic murine retinae in vitro, none of these strategies allow full characterization of RGC development and axon projections in vivo. To this end, we have developed two applications of electroporation, one in utero and the other ex vivo, to specifically target embryonic murine RGCs. With in utero retinal electroporation, we can misexpress or downregulate specific genes in RGCs and follow their axon projections through the visual pathways in vivo, allowing examination of guidance decisions at intermediate targets, such as the optic chiasm, or at target regions, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus. Perturbing gene expression in a subset of RGCs in an otherwise wild-type background facilitates an understanding of gene function throughout the retinal pathway. Additionally, we have developed a companion technique for analyzing RGC axon growth in vitro. We electroporate embryonic heads ex vivo, collect and incubate the whole retina, then prepare explants from these retinae several days later. Retinal explants can be used in a variety of in vitro assays in order to examine the response of electroporated RGC axons to guidance cues or other factors. In sum, this set of techniques enhances our ability to misexpress or downregulate genes in RGCs and should greatly aid studies examining RGC development and axon projections.",

Of the cerebellar neuronal types (granule cells, Purkinje cells and inhibitory interneurons), granule neurons are by far the most numerous and are the most abundant type of neurons in the mammalian brain. In rodents, cerebellar granule neurons are generated during the first two post-natal weeks from progenitor cells in the outermost layer of the cerebellar cortex, the external granule layer (EGL). The protocol presented here describes techniques to enrich and culture granule neurons and their progenitor cells from post-natal mouse cerebellum. We will describe procedures to obtain cultures of increasing purity which can be used to study the differentiation of proliferating progenitor cells into granule neurons. Once the progenitor cells differentiate, the cultures also provide a homogenous population of granule neurons for experimental manipulation and characterization of phenomena such as synaptogenesis, glutamate receptor function, interaction with other purified cerebellar cells or cell death.",

Although mechanisms underlying the formation of the uncrossed projection have been identified, the means by which retinal axons are guided across the midline are still unclear. In addition to directives provided by transcription factors and receptors in the retina, gene expression in the ventral diencephalon influences chiasm formation. Throughout this review, we compare guidance mechanisms at the optic chiasm with those in other midline models and highlight unanswered questions both for retinal axon growth and axon guidance in general.",

        "Abstract": "The navigation of retinal axons to ipsilateral and contralateral targets in the brain depends on the decision to cross or avoid the midline at the optic chiasm, a critical guidance maneuver that establishes the binocular visual pathway. Previous work has identified a specific guidance receptor, EphB1, that mediates the repulsion of uncrossed axons away from its ligand, ephrinB2, at the optic chiasm midline (Williams et al., 2003), and a transcription factor Zic2, that, like EphB1, is required for formation of the ipsilateral retinal projection (Herrera et al., 2003). Although the reported similarities in localization implicated that Zic2 regulates EphB1 (Herrera et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2003; Pak et al., 2004), whether Zic2 drives expression of EphB1 protein has not been elucidated. Here we show that EphB1 protein is expressed in the growth cones of axons from ventrotemporal (VT) retina that project ipsilaterally and that repulsion by ephrinB2 is determined by the presence of this receptor on growth cones. Moreover, ectopic delivery of Zic2 into explants from non-VT retina induces expression of EphB1 mRNA and protein. The upregulated EphB1 receptor protein is localized to growth cones and is functional, because it is sufficient to change retinal ganglion cell axon behavior from extension onto, to avoidance of, ephrinB2 substrates. Our results demonstrate that Zic2 upregulates EphB1 expression and define a link between a transcription factor and expression of a guidance receptor protein essential for axon guidance at the vertebrate midline.",

        "Title": "Differential effects of AMPA receptor activation on survival and neurite integrity during neuronal development.",
        "Abstract": "While neuronal cultures are an established model for analyzing excitotoxic brain injury in the adult, in vitro systems have not been extensively employed to study how developing neurons respond to levels of excitatory compounds that are lethal to mature neurons. Recently, we reported that the in vivo differentiation programs of cerebellar granule cells (CGNs) are recapitulated in purified CGN cultures [Manzini M.C., Ward M.S., Zhang Q., Lieberman M.D., Mason C.A. (2006) The stop-signal revised: immature cerebellar granule neurons in the external germinal layer arrest pontine mossy fiber growth. J. Neurosci. 26:6040-6051]. Here, we have used this model system to compare the response of immature and mature neurons to excitotoxic compounds. We found that immature CGNs are less sensitive to AMPA receptor (AMPA-R) activation than mature cells and that levels of AMPA-R expression on the plasma membrane are critical in regulating the balance between death and survival during maturation of these neurons. However, the majority of immature cells that survive excitotoxic treatment bear a degenerating neurite, suggesting that AMPA-R activation can still cause damage in the absence of cell death.",

        "Title": "The stop signal revised: immature cerebellar granule neurons in the external germinal layer arrest pontine mossy fiber growth.",
        "Abstract": "During the formation of neuronal circuits, afferent axons often enter target regions before their target cells are mature and then make temporary contacts with nonspecific targets before forming synapses on specific target cells. The regulation of these different steps of afferent-target interactions is poorly understood. The cerebellum is a good model for addressing these aspects, because cerebellar development is well defined and identified neurons in the circuitry can be purified and combined in vitro. Previous reports from our laboratory showed that cultured granule neurons specifically arrest the extension of their pontine mossy fiber afferents, leading us to propose that granule cells arrested growth of their afferents as a prelude to synaptogenesis. However, we knew little about the differentiation state of the cultured granule cells that mediate afferent arrest. In this study, we better define the purified granule cell fraction by marker expression and morphology, and demonstrate that only freshly plated granule cells in the precursor and premigratory state arrest mossy fiber outgrowth. Mature granule cells, in contrast, support extension, defasciculation, and synapse formation, as in vivo. In addition, axonal tracing in vivo during the first postnatal week indicates that immature mossy fibers extend into the Purkinje cell layer but never into the external germinal layer (EGL), where precursors of granule cell targets reside. We found that the stop-growing signals are dependent on heparin-binding factors, and we propose that such signals in the EGL restrict the extension of mossy fiber afferents and prevent invasion of proliferative regions.",

        "Abstract": "Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands play important roles in many aspects of visual system development. In this study, we characterized the spatial and temporal expression pattern of EphA4 in astrocyte precursor cell (APC) and astrocyte populations in the murine retina and optic nerve. EphA4 is expressed by immotile optic disc astrocyte precursor cells (ODAPS), but EphA4 is downregulated as these cells migrate into the retina. Surprisingly, mature astrocytes in the adult retina re-express EphA4. Within the optic nerve, EphA4 is expressed in specialized astrocytes that form a meshwork at the optic nerve head (ONH). Our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that EphA4 is dispensable for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon growth and projections through the chiasm. While optic stalk structure, APC proliferation and migration, retinal vascularization, and oligodendrocyte migration appear normal in EphA4 mutants, the expression of EphA4 in APCs and in the astrocyte meshwork at the ONH has implications for optic nerve pathologies.",

        "Abstract": "The mouse optic chiasm is a model for axon guidance at the midline and for analyzing how binocular vision is patterned. Recent work has identified several molecular players that influence the binary decision that retinal ganglion cells make at the optic chiasm, to either cross or avoid the midline. An ephrin-B localized to the midline, together with an EphB receptor and a zinc-finger transcription factor expressed exclusively in the ventrotemporal retina where ipsilaterally projecting retinal ganglion cells are located, comprise a molecular program for the uncrossed pathway. In addition, the mechanisms for axon divergence in the optic chiasm are discussed in the context of other popular models for midline axon guidance.",

        "Title": "Thyroid hormone induces cerebellar Purkinje cell dendritic development via the thyroid hormone receptor alpha1.",
        "Abstract": "The thyroid hormone l-3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) plays an important role during cerebellar development. Perinatal T3 deficiency leads to severe cellular perturbations, among them a striking reduction in the growth and branching of Purkinje cell dendritic arborization. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. Despite the well documented broad expression of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), analysis of different TR-deficient mice has failed to provide detailed information about the function of distinct TRs during neuronal development. The cerebellar cell culture systems offer an excellent model by which to study the effects of T3, because differentiation of cerebellar neurons in mixed and purified cultures proceeds in the absence of serum that contains T3. Addition of T3 to cerebellar cultures causes a dramatic increase in Purkinje cell dendrite branching and caliber in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that T3 acts on Purkinje cells directly through TRalpha1 expressed on the Purkinje cell and not on the granule cell, the presynaptic partner of Purkinje cells. In contrast, TRbeta isoforms are not involved, because Purkinje cells derived from TRbeta-/- mice show the same T3 responsiveness as wild-type cells. T3-promoted Purkinje cell differentiation was not mediated via neurotrophins, as suggested previously, because dendritogenesis of Purkinje cells from BDNF-/- mice could be effectively stimulated in vitro by T3 treatment. Furthermore, the effects of T3 observed were not abolished by tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB)-IgG, TrkC-IgG, or K252a, agents known to block the actions of neurotrophin. These results indicate that T3 directly affects Purkinje cell differentiation through activation of the TRalpha1.",

        "Abstract": "During CNS development, combinatorial expression of transcription factors controls neuronal subtype identity and subsequent axonal trajectory. Regulatory genes designating the routing of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons at the optic chiasm to the appropriate hemisphere, a pattern critical for proper binocular vision, have not been identified. Here, we show that the zinc finger transcription factor Zic2, a vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila gene odd-paired, is expressed in RGCs with an uncrossed trajectory during the period when this subpopulation grows from the ventrotemporal retina toward the optic chiasm. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses indicate that Zic2 is necessary and sufficient to regulate RGC axon repulsion by cues at the optic chiasm midline. Moreover, Zic2 expression reflects the extent of binocularity in different species, suggesting that Zic2 is an evolutionarily conserved determinant of RGCs that project ipsilaterally. These data provide evidence for transcriptional coding of axon pathfinding at the midline.",

Other new evidence has revealed that spines continue to be motile even after they settle on a presynaptic partner and form a synapse. We present the evidence for each view, and discuss how spines with synapses could move relative to their apparently stable presynaptic partners. Thus, spine motility might not simply be a means towards an end of synapse formation, but could continue, albeit at a lower rate, during synapse turnover after development ends.",

        "Abstract": "To study the relationship among tyrosinase activity, melanin production, and the routing of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons at the optic chiasm, we analysed mice with varying doses of the tyrosinase gene. These include the dark-eyed albino (Tyrc44H), a radiation-induced hypomorphic allele of tyrosinase; and transgenic mice carrying 1 or 2 alleles of a tyrosinase minigene on both wild-type (Tyr+) and albino (Tyrc) backgrounds. Melanization of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) occurred gradually even at <2% wild-type tyrosinase activity and was sensitive to tyrosinase activity up to <35% of wild-type levels, beyond which melanin synthesis appeared to be saturated. Overexpression of tyrosinase led to tyrosinase activity above wild type level, but did not increase melanin production. Although a loss of melanin because of a mutation in tyrosinase is associated with a decrease in the number of uncrossed fibers, elevating tyrosinase levels does not appear to cause an increase in the size of the uncrossed retinal projection. Our results suggest that replacing less than 35% of wild-type tyrosinase activity is sufficient to restore normal pigmentation of the RPE, and potentially, to allay visual defects.",

        "Title": "Spatiotemporal features of early neuronogenesis differ in wild-type and albino mouse retina.",
        "Abstract": "In albino mammals, lack of pigment in the retinal pigment epithelium is associated with retinal defects, including poor visual acuity from a photoreceptor deficit in the central retina and poor depth perception from a decrease in ipsilaterally projecting retinal fibers. Possible contributors to these abnormalities are reported delays in neuronogenesis (Ilia and Jeffery, 1996) and retinal maturation (Webster and Rowe, 1991). To further determine possible perturbations in neuronogenesis and/or differentiation, we used cell-specific markers and refined birth dating methods to examine these events during retinal ganglion cell (RGC) genesis in albino and pigmented mice from embryonic day 11 (E11) to E18. Our data indicate that relative to pigmented mice, more ganglion cells are born in the early stages of neuronogenesis in the albino retina, although the initiation of RGC genesis in the albino is unchanged. The cellular organization of the albino retina is perturbed as early as E12. In addition, cell cycle kinetics and output along the nasotemporal axis differ in retinas of albino and pigmented mice, both absolutely, with the temporal aspect of the retina expanded in albino, and relative to the position of the optic nerve head. Finally, blocking melanin synthesis in pigmented eyecups in culture leads to an increase in RGC differentiation, consistent with a role for melanin formation in regulating RGC neuronogenesis. These results point to spatiotemporal defects in neuronal production in the albino retina, which could perturb expression of genes that specify cell fate, number, and/or projection phenotype.",
