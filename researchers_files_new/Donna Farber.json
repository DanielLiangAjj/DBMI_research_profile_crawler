        "Abstract": "During ontogeny, γδ T cells emerge from the thymus and directly seed peripheral tissues for in situ immunity. However, their functional role in humans has largely been defined from blood. Here, we analyzed the phenotype, transcriptome, function, and repertoire of human γδ T cells in blood and mucosal and lymphoid tissues from 176 donors across the life span, revealing distinct profiles in children compared with adults. In early life, clonally diverse Vδ1 subsets predominate across blood and tissues, comprising naïve and differentiated effector and tissue repair functions, whereas cytolytic Vδ2 subsets populate blood, spleen, and lungs. With age, Vδ1 and Vδ2 subsets exhibit clonal expansions and elevated cytolytic signatures, which are disseminated across sites. In adults, Vδ2 cells predominate in blood, whereas Vδ1 cells are enriched across tissues and express residency profiles. Thus, antigenic exposures over childhood drive the functional evolution and tissue compartmentalization of γδ T cells, leading to age-dependent roles in immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Immune memory - comprising T cells, B cells and plasma cells and their secreted antibodies - is crucial for human survival. It enables the rapid and effective clearance of a pathogen after re-exposure, to minimize damage to the host. When antigen-experienced, memory T cells become activated, they proliferate and produce effector molecules at faster rates and in greater magnitudes than antigen-inexperienced, naive cells. Similarly, memory B cells become activated and differentiate into antibody-secreting cells more rapidly than naive B cells, and they undergo processes that increase their affinity for antigen. The ability of T cells and B cells to form memory cells after antigen exposure is the rationale behind vaccination. Understanding immune memory not only is crucial for the design of more-efficacious vaccines but also has important implications for immunotherapies in infectious disease and cancer. This 'guide to' article provides an overview of the current understanding of the phenotype, function, location, and pathways for the generation, maintenance and protective capacity of memory T cells and memory B cells.",

Here, we investigated T cells in mucosal sites, lymphoid tissues, and blood from 96 pediatric donors aged 0-10 years using phenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic profiling. Our results revealed that memory T cells preferentially localized in the intestines and lungs during infancy and accumulated more rapidly in mucosal sites compared with blood and lymphoid organs, consistent with site-specific antigen exposure. Early life mucosal memory T cells exhibit distinct functional capacities and stem-like transcriptional profiles. In later childhood, they progressively adopt proinflammatory functions and tissue-resident signatures, coincident with increased T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion in mucosal and lymphoid sites.

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection for most children results in mild or minimal symptoms, though in rare cases severe disease can develop, including a multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) with myocarditis. Here, we present longitudinal profiling of immune responses during acute disease and following recovery in children who developed MIS-C, relative to children who experienced more typical symptoms of COVID-19. T cells in acute MIS-C exhibited transient signatures of activation, inflammation, and tissue residency which correlated with cardiac disease severity, while T cells in acute COVID-19 upregulated markers of follicular helper T cells for promoting antibody production. The resultant memory immune response in recovery showed increased frequencies of virus-specific memory T cells with pro-inflammatory functions in children with prior MIS-C compared to COVID-19 while both cohorts generated comparable antibody responses. Together our results reveal distinct effector and memory T cell responses in pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection delineated by clinical syndrome, and a potential role for tissue-derived T cells in the immune pathology of systemic disease.",

In an analysis of human lymph nodes (LNs) from 84 organ donors aged 11-93 years, we found a specific age-related decline in lung-associated, but not gut-associated, LN immune function linked to the accumulation of inhaled atmospheric particulate matter. Increasing densities of particulates were found in lung-associated LNs with age, but not in the corresponding gut-associated LNs. Particulates were specifically contained within CD68",

As SARS-CoV-2 is tropic to the respiratory tract, many studies of airway washes, lymph node aspirates, and postmortem lung tissue have revealed site-specific immune dynamics that are associated with the protection or immunopathology but are not readily observed in circulation. This review summarizes the growing body of work identifying immune processes in tissues and their interplay with immune responses in circulation during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe disease, and memory persistence. Establishment of tissue resident immunity also may have implications for vaccination and the durability of immune memory and protection.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue-resident immune cells span both myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages, have been found in multiple human tissues, and play integral roles at all stages of the immune response, from maintaining homeostasis to responding to infectious challenges to resolution of inflammation to tissue repair. In humans, studying immune cells and responses in tissues is challenging, although recent advances in sampling and high-dimensional profiling have provided new insights into the ontogeny, maintenance, and functional role of tissue-resident immune cells. Each tissue contains a specific complement of resident immune cells. Moreover, resident immune cells for each lineage share core properties, along with tissue-specific adaptations. Here we propose a five-point checklist for defining resident immune cell types in humans and describe the currently known features of resident immune cells, their mechanisms of development, and their putative functional roles within various human organs. We also consider these aspects of resident immune cells in the context of future studies and therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Infants require coordinated immune responses to prevent succumbing to multiple infectious challenges during early life, particularly in the respiratory tract. The mechanisms by which infant T cells are functionally adapted for these responses are not well understood. Here, we demonstrated using an in vivo mouse cotransfer model that infant T cells generated greater numbers of lung-homing effector cells in response to influenza infection compared with adult T cells in the same host, due to augmented T cell receptor (TCR)–mediated signaling. Mouse infant T cells showed increased sensitivity to low antigen doses, originating at the interface between T cells and antigen-bearing accessory cells—through actin-mediated mobilization of signaling molecules to the immune synapse. This enhanced signaling was also observed in human infant versus adult T cells. Our findings provide a mechanism for how infants control pathogen load and dissemination, which is important for designing developmentally targeted strategies for promoting immune responses at this vulnerable life stage.",

Here, we examined the relationship between immune processes in the respiratory tract and circulation through longitudinal phenotypic, transcriptomic, and cytokine profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19 relative to heathy controls. In COVID-19 airways, T cells exhibited activated, tissue-resident, and protective profiles; higher T cell frequencies correlated with survival and younger age. Myeloid cells in COVID-19 airways featured hyperinflammatory signatures, and higher frequencies of these cells correlated with mortality and older age. In COVID-19 blood, aberrant CD163",

TRM express residence gene signatures. This feature allows them to traffic to, reside in, and potentially patrol peripheral tissues, thereby enforcing an efficient long-term immune-protective role. Recent studies have revealed TRM involvement in tumor immune responses. TRM tumor infiltration correlates with enhanced response to current immunotherapy and is often associated with favorable clinical outcome in patients with cancer. Thus, targeting TRM may lead to enhanced cancer immunotherapy efficacy. Here, we review and discuss recent advances on the nature of TRM in the context of tumor immunity and immunotherapy.",

Immune responses are orchestrated by T cells, which direct pathogen clearance at the infection site and establish tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) for protection immunity.

        "Abstract": "Influenza infection generates tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) that are maintained in the lung and can mediate protective immunity to heterologous influenza strains, but the precise mechanisms of local T cell-mediated protection are not well understood. In a murine heterosubtypic influenza challenge model, we demonstrate that protective lung T cell responses derive from both in situ activation of TRMs and the enhanced generation of effector T cells from the local lung draining mediastinal lymph nodes (medLNs). Primary infection fortified the medLNs with an increased number of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) that mediate enhanced priming of T cells, including those specific for newly encountered epitopes; cDC depletion during the recall response diminished medLN T cell generation and heterosubtypic immunity. Our study shows that during a protective recall response, cDCs in a fortified LN environment enhance the breadth, generation, and tissue migration of effector T cells to augment lung TRM responses.",

        "Abstract": "The human immune system is comprised of a diverse and interactive network of specialized cells localized in diverse tissues throughout the body, where they mediate protection against pathogens and environmental insults while maintaining tissue homeostasis. Although much of our understanding of human immunology has derived from studies of peripheral blood, recent work utilizing human tissue resources and innovative computational methods have employed a whole-body, systems-based approach, revealing tremendous complexity and heterogeneity of the immune system within individuals and across the population. In this review, we discuss how tissue localization, developmental and age-associated changes, and conditions of health and disease shape the immune response, as well as how improved understanding of interindividual and tissue-specific immunity can be leveraged for developing targeted therapeutics.",

In this issue of Cell, Crespo et al. show that human NK cells in the decidual region of the uterus can clear a bacterial infection from the developing fetus by infusion of granulysin into placental trophoblast cells via nanotubes, thus removing the intracellular pathogen without damage to the placental cell. These findings reveal a mechanism for targeted immune protection of the developing fetus that maintains tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface.",

        "Abstract": "Although human B cells have been extensively studied, most reports have used peripheral blood as a source. Here, we used a unique tissue resource derived from healthy organ donors to deeply characterize human B-cell compartments across multiple tissues and donors. These datasets revealed that B cells in the blood are not in homeostasis with compartments in other tissues. We found striking donor-to-donor variability in the frequencies and isotype of CD27+ memory B cells (MBCs). A comprehensive antibody-based screen revealed markers of MBC and allowed identification of novel MBC subsets with distinct functions defined according to surface expression of CD69 and CD45RB. We defined a tissue-resident MBC phenotype that was predominant in the gut but absent in blood. RNA-sequencing of MBC subsets from multiple tissues revealed a tissue-resident MBC gene signature as well as gut- and spleen-specific signatures. Overall, these studies provide novel insights into the nature and function of human B-cell compartments across multiple tissues.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age. While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasaki's disease. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age.",

        "Abstract": "Immune responses in diverse tissue sites are critical for protective immunity and homeostasis. Here, we investigate how tissue localization regulates the development and function of human natural killer (NK) cells, innate lymphocytes important for anti-viral and tumor immunity. Integrating high-dimensional analysis of NK cells from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissue sites from 60 individuals, we identify tissue-specific patterns of NK cell subset distribution, maturation, and function maintained across age and between individuals. Mature and terminally differentiated NK cells with enhanced effector function predominate in blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lungs and exhibit shared transcriptional programs across sites. By contrast, precursor and immature NK cells with reduced effector capacity populate lymph nodes and intestines and exhibit tissue-resident signatures and site-specific adaptations. Together, our results reveal anatomic control of NK cell development and maintenance as tissue-resident populations, whereas mature, terminally differentiated subsets mediate immunosurveillance through diverse peripheral sites.

LNSCs normally regulate T cell trafficking and survival and help to maintain peripheral tolerance by exerting immunosuppressive effects. However, whether autoimmunity can be associated with defective tolerogenic functions of LNSCs is unknown and studies aimed at characterising LNSCs in humans are lacking. We hypothesised that dysregulated T cell responses in pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) from donors with type 1 diabetes and from NOD mice may be associated with altered LNSC function.",

        "Abstract": "The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ essential for the development of T lymphocytes, which orchestrate adaptive immune responses. T-cell development in the thymus is spatially regulated; key checkpoints in T-cell maturation and selection occur in cortical and medullary regions to eliminate self-reactive T cells, establish central tolerance, and export naïve T cells to the periphery with the potential to recognize diverse pathogens. Thymic output is also temporally regulated due to age-related involution of the thymus accompanied by loss of epithelial cells. This review discusses the structural and age-related control of thymus function in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Defining adaptive immunity with the complex structures of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract over life is essential for understanding immune responses to ingested antigens, commensal and pathogenic microorganisms, and dysfunctions in disease. We present here an analysis of lymphocyte localization and T cell subset composition across the human GI tract including mucosal sites (jejunum, ileum, colon), gut-associated lymphoid tissues (isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs), Peyer's patches (PPs), appendix), and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) from a total of 68 donors spanning eight decades of life. In pediatric donors, ILFs and PP containing naïve T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are prevalent in the jejunum and ileum, respectively; these decline in frequency with age, contrasting stable frequencies of ILFs and T cell subsets in the colon. In the mucosa, tissue resident memory T cells develop during childhood, and persist in high frequencies into advanced ages, while T cell composition changes with age in GALT and MLN. These spatial and temporal features of human intestinal T cell immunity define signatures that can be used to train predictive machine learning algorithms. Our findings demonstrate an anatomic basis for age-associated alterations in immune responses, and establish a quantitative baseline for intestinal immunity to define disease pathologies.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) accelerate pathogen clearance through rapid and enhanced functional responses in situ. TRMs are prevalent in diverse anatomic sites throughout the human lifespan, yet their phenotypic and functional diversity has not been fully described. Here, we identify subpopulations of human TRMs based on the ability to efflux fluorescent dyes [efflux(+) TRMs] located within mucosal and lymphoid sites with distinct transcriptional profiles, turnover, and functional capacities. Compared with efflux(-) TRMs, efflux(+) TRMs showed transcriptional and phenotypic features of quiescence including reduced turnover, decreased expression of exhaustion markers, and increased proliferative capacity and signaling in response to homeostatic cytokines. Moreover, upon activation, efflux(+) TRMs secreted lower levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-2 and underwent reduced degranulation. Interestingly, analysis of TRM subsets following activation revealed that both efflux(+) and efflux(-) TRMs undergo extensive transcriptional changes following TCR ligation but retain core TRM transcriptional properties including retention markers, suggesting that TRMs carry out effector function in situ.

        "Abstract": "Viral respiratory tract infections (VRTI) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among infants and young children. In mice, optimal protection to VRTI is mediated by recruitment of effector T cells to the lungs and respiratory tract, and subsequent establishment of tissue resident memory T cells (Trm), which provide long-term protection. These critical processes of T cell recruitment to the respiratory tract, their role in disease pathogenesis, and establishment of local protective immunity remain undefined in pediatric VRTI. In this study, we investigated T cell responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) of infants and young children with VRTI, revealing developmental regulation of T cell differentiation and Trm generation in situ. We show a direct concurrence between T cell responses in the URT and LRT, including a preponderance of effector CD8",

In mouse models, the role of T cells is studied in the context of a specific type of pathogen, antigen, or disease condition over a limited time frame, whereas in humans, T cells control multiple insults simultaneously throughout the body and maintain immune homeostasis over decades. In this review, we discuss how human T cells develop and provide essential immune protection at different life stages and highlight tissue localization and subset delineation as key determinants of the T cell functional role in immune responses. We also discuss how anatomic compartments undergo distinct age-associated changes in T cell subset composition and function over a lifetime. It is important to consider age and tissue influences on human T cells when developing targeted strategies to modulate T cell-mediated immunity in vaccines and immunotherapies.",

A subset of lung T cells can persist as tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) following infection and allergen induction, although the generation and role of TRM in asthma persistence and pathogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we used a mouse model of chronic exposure to intranasal house dust mite (HDM) extract to dissect how lung TRMs are generated and function in the persistence and pathogenesis of allergic airway disease.

        "Abstract": "The immune system in early life is tasked with transitioning from a relatively protected environment to one in which it encounters a wide variety of innocuous antigens and dangerous pathogens. The immaturity of the developing immune system, and particularly the distinct functionality of T lymphocytes in early life, has been implicated in increased susceptibility to infection. Previous work has demonstrated that immune responses in early life are skewed toward limited inflammation and atopy; however, there is mounting evidence that such responses are context- and tissue-dependent. The regulation, differentiation, and maintenance of infant T cell responses, particularly as it relates to tissue compartmentalization, remains poorly understood. How the tissue environment impacts early-life immune responses and whether the development of localized protective immune memory cell subsets are established is an emerging area of research. As infectious diseases affecting the respiratory and digestive tracts are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in infants and young children, a deeper understanding of site-specific immunity is essential to addressing these challenges. Here, we review the current paradigms of T cell responses during infancy as they relate to tissue localization and discuss implications for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Infants suffer disproportionately from respiratory infections and generate reduced vaccine responses compared with adults, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In adult mice, lung-localized, tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) mediate optimal protection to respiratory pathogens, and we hypothesized that reduced protection in infancy could be due to impaired establishment of lung TRM. Using an infant mouse model, we demonstrate generation of lung-homing, virus-specific T effectors after influenza infection or live-attenuated vaccination, similar to adults. However, infection during infancy generated markedly fewer lung TRMs, and heterosubtypic protection was reduced compared with adults. Impaired TRM establishment was infant-T cell intrinsic, and infant effectors displayed distinct transcriptional profiles enriched for T-bet-regulated genes. Notably, mouse and human infant T cells exhibited increased T-bet expression after activation, and reduction of T-bet levels in infant mice enhanced lung TRM establishment. Our findings reveal that infant T cells are intrinsically programmed for short-term responses, and targeting key regulators could promote long-term, tissue-targeted protection at this critical life stage.",

        "Abstract": "T cell responses to viruses are initiated and maintained in tissue sites; however, knowledge of human antiviral T cells is largely derived from blood. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) persists in most humans, requires T cell immunity to control, yet tissue immune responses remain undefined. Here, we investigated human CMV-specific T cells, virus persistence and CMV-associated T cell homeostasis in blood, lymphoid, mucosal and secretory tissues of 44 CMV seropositive and 28 seronegative donors. CMV-specific T cells were maintained in distinct distribution patterns, highest in blood, bone marrow (BM), or lymph nodes (LN), with the frequency and function in blood distinct from tissues. CMV genomes were detected predominantly in lung and also in spleen, BM, blood and LN. High frequencies of activated CMV-specific T cells were found in blood and BM samples with low virus detection, whereas in lung, CMV-specific T cells were present along with detectable virus. In LNs, CMV-specific T cells exhibited quiescent phenotypes independent of virus. Overall, T cell differentiation was enhanced in sites of viral persistence with age. Together, our results suggest tissue T cell reservoirs for CMV control shaped by both viral and tissue-intrinsic factors, with global effects on homeostasis of tissue T cells over the lifespan.",

        "Abstract": "Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1 infection reduces plasma virus levels to below the limit of detection of clinical assays. However, even with prolonged suppression of viral replication with ART, viremia rebounds rapidly after treatment interruption. Thus, ART is not curative. The principal barrier to cure is a remarkably stable reservoir of latent HIV-1 in resting memory CD4(+) T cells. In this review, we consider explanations for the remarkable stability of the latent reservoir. Stability does not appear to reflect replenishment from new infection events but rather normal physiologic processes that provide for immunologic memory. Of particular importance are proliferative processes that drive clonal expansion of infected cells. Recent evidence suggests that in some infected cells, proliferation is a consequence of proviral integration into host genes associated with cell growth. Efforts to cure HIV-1 infection by targeting the latent reservoir may need to consider the potential of latently infected cells to proliferate.",

        "Abstract": "It is unclear how the immune response in early life becomes appropriately stimulated to provide protection while also avoiding excessive activation as a result of diverse new antigens. T cells are integral to adaptive immunity; mouse studies indicate that tissue localization of T cell subsets is important for both protective immunity and immunoregulation. In humans, however, the early development and function of T cells in tissues remain unexplored. We present here an analysis of lymphoid and mucosal tissue T cells derived from pediatric organ donors in the first two years of life, as compared to adult organ donors, revealing early compartmentalization of T cell differentiation and regulation. Whereas adult tissues contain a predominance of memory T cells, in pediatric blood and tissues the main subset consists of naive recent thymic emigrants, with effector memory T cells (T(EM)) found only in the lungs and small intestine. Additionally, regulatory T (T(reg)) cells comprise a high proportion (30-40%) of CD4(+) T cells in pediatric tissues but are present at much lower frequencies (1-10%) in adult tissues. Pediatric tissue T(reg) cells suppress endogenous T cell activation, and early T cell functionality is confined to the mucosal sites that have the lowest T(reg):T(EM) cell ratios, which suggests control in situ of immune responses in early life.",

        "Abstract": "Infants and young children are disproportionately susceptible to severe complications from respiratory viruses, although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Recent studies show that the T cell response in the lung is important for protective responses to respiratory infections, although details on the infant/pediatric respiratory immune response remain sparse. The objectives of the present study were to characterize the local versus systemic immune response in infants and young children with respiratory failure from viral respiratory tract infections and its association to disease severity. Daily airway secretions were sampled from infants and children 4 years of age and younger receiving mechanical ventilation owing to respiratory failure from viral infection or noninfectious causes. Samples were examined for immune cell composition and markers of T cell activation. These parameters were then correlated with clinical disease severity. Innate immune cells and total CD3(+) T cells were present in similar proportions in airway aspirates derived from infected and uninfected groups; however, the CD8:CD4 T cell ratio was markedly increased in the airways of patients with viral infection compared with uninfected patients, and specifically in infected infants with acute lung injury. T cells in the airways were phenotypically and functionally distinct from those in blood with activated/memory phenotypes and increased cytotoxic capacity. We identified a significant increase in airway cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells in infants with lung injury from viral respiratory tract infection that was distinct from the T cell profile in circulation and associated with increasing disease severity. Airway sampling could therefore be diagnostically informative for assessing immune responses and lung damage.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is a key signaling molecule downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and is a master regulator of multiple kinases in cells of epithelial and hematopoietic lineages. The physiological role of PDK1 in regulating skin and immune homeostasis is not known. Here we developed a mouse model in which PDK1 is conditionally ablated in activated CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells, and mature keratinocytes through OX40-Cre recombinase expression. The resultant mice (PDK1-CKO) spontaneously developed severe dermatitis, skin fibrosis, and systemic T helper type 2 immunity, succumbing by 11 weeks of age. Through a series of T-cell transfers, bone marrow reconstitutions, and crossing to lymphocyte-deficient backgrounds, we demonstrate that ablation of PDK1 in keratinocytes is the major driver of disease pathogenesis. PDK1-deficient keratinocytes exhibit intrinsic defects in the expression of key structural proteins including cytokeratin-10 and loricrin, resulting in increased keratinocyte turnover, which in turn triggers inflammation, T-cell recruitment, and immune-mediated destruction. Our results reveal PDK1 as a central regulator of keratinocyte homeostasis that prevents skin immune infiltration and inflammation.",

Mouse studies of T cell immunity show that, in response to infection, T cells migrate to diverse sites and persist as tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), which mediate rapid in situ protection on antigen recall. Here we discuss new approaches to probe human T cell immunity, including novel sampling, that indicate a broad distribution and high frequency of human TRM in multiple sites. These newer findings further implicate anatomic compartmentalization as a generalized mechanism for long-term maintenance of human T cells throughout life.",

We present here a multidimensional, quantitative analysis of human T cell compartmentalization and maintenance over six decades of life in blood, lymphoid, and mucosal tissues obtained from 56 individual organ donors. Our results reveal that the distribution and tissue residence of naive, central, and effector memory, and terminal effector subsets is contingent on both their differentiation state and tissue localization. Moreover, T cell homeostasis driven by cytokine or TCR-mediated signals is different in CD4+ or CD8+ T cell lineages, varies with their differentiation stage and tissue localization, and cannot be inferred from blood. Our data provide an unprecedented spatial and temporal map of human T cell compartmentalization and maintenance, supporting distinct pathways for human T cell fate determination and homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) comprise a newly defined subset, which comprises a major component of lymphocyte populations in diverse peripheral tissue sites, including mucosal tissues, barrier surfaces, and in other non-lymphoid and lymphoid sites in humans and mice. Many studies have focused on the role of CD8 TRM in protection; however, there is now accumulating evidence that CD4 TRM predominate in tissue sites, and are integral for in situ protective immunity, particularly in mucosal sites. New evidence suggests that mucosal CD4 TRM populations differentiate at tissue sites following the recruitment of effector T cells by local inflammation or infection. The resulting TRM populations are enriched in T-cell specificities associated with the inducing pathogen/antigen. This compartmentalization of memory T cells at specific tissue sites may provide an optimal design for future vaccination strategies. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that CD4 TRM may also play a role in immunoregulation and immunopathology, and therefore, targeting TRM may be a viable therapeutic approach to treat inflammatory diseases in mucosal sites. This review will summarize our current understanding of CD4 TRM in diverse tissues, with an emphasis on their role in protective immunity and the mechanisms by which these populations are established and maintained in diverse mucosal sites.",

        "Abstract": "Influenza A virus is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among young children and the elderly. Current vaccines induce neutralizing antibody responses directed toward highly variable viral surface proteins, resulting in limited heterosubtypic protection to new viral serotypes. By contrast, memory CD4 T cells recognize conserved viral proteins and are cross-reactive to multiple influenza strains. In humans, virus-specific memory CD4 T cells were found to be the protective correlate in human influenza challenge studies, suggesting their key role in protective immunity. In mouse models, memory CD4 T cells can mediate protective responses to secondary influenza infection independent of B cells or CD8 T cells, and can influence innate immune responses. Importantly, a newly defined, tissue-resident CD4 memory population has been demonstrated to be retained in lung tissue and promote optimal protective responses to an influenza infection. Here, we review the current state of results regarding the generation of memory CD4 T cells following primary influenza infection, mechanisms for their enhanced efficacy in protection from secondary challenge including their phenotype, localization, and function in the context of both mouse models and human infection. We also discuss the generation of memory CD4 T cells in response to influenza vaccines and its future implications for vaccinology.",

        "Abstract": "T cells coordinate rejection of transplanted allografts and are key targets for depletion, immunosuppression, and tolerance induction to promote long-term graft survival. Studies in mouse models and humans generally focus on circulating T cells or those from lymphoid sites; however, vast numbers of T cells reside in multiple peripheral tissue sites including lungs, intestines, liver, and skin as non-circulating, tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm cells). In this review, we define the basic properties of Trm cells, the emerging evidence of their importance for protective immunity, and the potential role of resident versus circulating T cells in transplant rejection and in providing protection to prevalent infections posttransplantation. We also discuss potential susceptibilities and/or resistance of protective Trm to immunosuppression therapies, and how consideration of Trm, their compartmentalization, and specificity can enable improved therapies for targeted inhibition of pathogenic and preservation of protective T-cell subsets.",

        "Abstract": "In healthy individuals, influenza virus (IAV) infection generally remains localized to the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. Previously, IAV-specific effector CD8 T cells found systemically during the course of IAV infection were thought to have been primed in lung-draining lymph nodes with subsequent migration to other tissues. However, little is known about whether other lymphoid sites participate in the generation of virus-specific CD8 T cells during localized IAV infection. Here, we present evidence of early CD8 T cell priming in the spleen following respiratory IAV infection independent of lung-draining lymph node priming of T cells. Although we found early indications of CD8 T cell activation in the lymph nodes draining the respiratory tract, we also saw evidence of virus-specific CD8 T cell activation in the spleen. Furthermore, CD8 T cells primed in the spleen differentiated into memory cells of equivalent longevity and with similar recall capacity as CD8 T cells primed in the draining lymph nodes. These data showed that the spleen contributes to the virus-specific effector and memory CD8 T cell populations that are generated in response to respiratory infection.",

Here, we present a unique analysis of human T cells in lymphoid and mucosal tissues obtained from individual organ donors, revealing tissue-intrinsic compartmentalization of naive, effector, and memory subsets conserved between diverse individuals. Effector memory CD4(+) T cells producing IL-2 predominated in mucosal tissues and accumulated as central memory subsets in lymphoid tissue, whereas CD8(+) T cells were maintained as naive subsets in lymphoid tissues and IFN-γ-producing effector memory CD8(+) T cells in mucosal sites. The T cell activation marker CD69 was constitutively expressed by memory T cells in all tissues, distinguishing them from circulating subsets, with mucosal memory T cells exhibiting additional distinct phenotypic and functional properties. Our results provide an assessment of human T cell compartmentalization as a new baseline for understanding human adaptive immunity.",

Tissue-resident memory CD4 T cells in the lung did not circulate or emigrate from the lung in parabiosis experiments, were protected from in vivo Ab labeling, and expressed elevated levels of CD69 and CD11a compared with those of circulating memory populations. Importantly, influenza-specific lung-resident memory CD4 T cells served as in situ protectors to respiratory viral challenge, mediating enhanced viral clearance and survival to lethal influenza infection. By contrast, memory CD4 T cells isolated from spleen recirculated among multiple tissues without retention and failed to mediate protection to influenza infection, despite their ability to expand and migrate to the lung. Our results reveal tissue compartmentalization as a major determining factor for immune-mediated protection in a key mucosal site, important for targeting local protective responses in vaccines and immunotherapies.",

        "Abstract": "Memory T cells are distinguished from naive T cells by their rapid production of effector cytokines, although mechanisms for this recall response remain undefined. In this study, we investigated transcriptional mechanisms for rapid IFN-γ production by Ag-specific memory CD4 T cells. In naive CD4 T cells, IFN-γ production only occurred after sustained Ag activation and was associated with high expression of the T-bet transcription factor required for Th1 differentiation and with T-bet binding to the IFN-γ promoter as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. By contrast, immediate IFN-γ production by Ag-stimulated memory CD4 T cells occurred in the absence of significant nuclear T-bet expression or T-bet engagement on the IFN-γ promoter. We identified rapid induction of NF-κB transcriptional activity and increased engagement of NF-κB on the IFN-γ promoter at rapid times after TCR stimulation of memory compared with naive CD4 T cells. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of NF-κB activity or peptide-mediated inhibition of NF-κB p50 translocation abrogated early memory T cell signaling and TCR-mediated effector function. Our results reveal a molecular mechanism for memory T cell recall through enhanced NF-κB p50 activation and promoter engagement, with important implications for memory T cell modulation in vaccines, autoimmunity, and transplantation.",

        "Abstract": "Pertussis (whooping cough) is frequently complicated by concomitant infections with respiratory viruses. Here we report the effect of Bordetella pertussis infection on subsequent influenza virus (PR8) infection in mouse models and the role of pertussis toxin (PT) in this effect. BALB/c mice infected with a wild-type strain of B. pertussis (WT) and subsequently (up to 14 days later) infected with PR8 had significantly increased pulmonary viral titers, lung pathology and mortality compared to mice similarly infected with a PT-deficient mutant strain (ΔPT) and PR8. Substitution of WT infection by intranasal treatment with purified active PT was sufficient to replicate the exacerbating effects on PR8 infection in BALB/c and C57/BL6 mice, but the effects of PT were lost when toxin was administered 24 h after virus inoculation. PT had no effect on virus titers in primary cultures of murine tracheal epithelial cells (mTECs) in vitro, suggesting the toxin targets an early immune response to increase viral titers in the mouse model. However, type I interferon responses were not affected by PT. Whole genome microarray analysis of gene expression in lung tissue from PT-treated and control PR8-infected mice at 12 and 36 h post-virus inoculation revealed that PT treatment suppressed numerous genes associated with communication between innate and adaptive immune responses. In mice depleted of alveolar macrophages, increase of pulmonary viral titers by PT treatment was lost. PT also suppressed levels of IL-1β, IL-12, IFN-γ, IL-6, KC, MCP-1 and TNF-α in the airways after PR8 infection. Furthermore PT treatment inhibited early recruitment of neutrophils and NK cells to the airways. Together these findings demonstrate that infection with B. pertussis through PT activity predisposes the host to exacerbated influenza infection by countering protective innate immune responses that control virus titers.",

        "Title": "Memory CD4 T cells direct protective responses to influenza virus in the lungs through helper-independent mechanisms.",
        "Abstract": "Memory CD4 T cells specific for influenza virus are generated from natural infection and vaccination, persist long-term, and recognize determinants in seasonal and pandemic influenza virus strains. However, the protective potential of these long-lived influenza virus-specific memory CD4 T cells is not clear, including whether CD4 T-cell helper or effector functions are important in secondary antiviral responses. Here we demonstrate that memory CD4 T cells specific for H1N1 influenza virus directed protective responses to influenza virus challenge through intrinsic effector mechanisms, resulting in enhanced viral clearance, recovery from sublethal infection, and full protection from lethal challenge. Mice with influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)-specific memory CD4 T cells or polyclonal influenza virus-specific memory CD4 T cells exhibited protection from influenza virus challenge that occurred in the presence of CD8-depleting antibodies in B-cell-deficient mice and when CD4 T cells were transferred into lymphocyte-deficient RAG2(-/-) mice. Moreover, the presence of memory CD4 T cells mobilized enhanced T-cell recruitment and immune responses in the lung. Neutralization of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production in vivo abrogated memory CD4 T-cell-mediated protection from influenza virus challenge by HA-specific memory T cells and heterosubtypic protection by polyclonal memory CD4 T cells. Our results indicate that memory CD4 T cells can direct enhanced protection from influenza virus infection through mobilization of immune effectors in the lung, independent of their helper functions. These findings have important implications for the generation of universal influenza vaccines by promoting long-lived protective CD4 T-cell responses.",

        "Abstract": "The development of immune memory mediated by T lymphocytes is central to durable, long-lasting protective immunity. A key issue in the field is how to direct the generation and persistence of memory T cells to elicit the appropriate secondary response to provide protection to a specific pathogen. Two prevailing views have emerged; that cellular and molecular regulators control the lineage fate and functional capacities of memory T cells early after priming, or alternatively, that populations of memory T cells are inherently plastic and subject to alterations in function and/or survival at many stages during their long-term maintenance. Here, we will review current findings in CD4 T-cell memory that suggest inherent plasticity in populations of memory CD4 T cells at all stages of their development--originating with their generation from multiple types of primed CD4 T cells, during their persistence and homeostatic turnover in response to T-cell receptor signals, and also following secondary challenge. These multiple aspects of memory CD4 T-cell flexibility contrast the more defined lineages and functions ascribed to memory CD8 T cells, suggesting a dynamic nature to memory CD4 T-cell populations and responses. The flexible attributes of CD4 T-cell memory suggest opportunities and mechanisms for therapeutic manipulation at all phases of immune memory development, maintenance and recall.",

        "Abstract": "The intracellular signaling mechanisms regulating the generation and long-term persistence of memory T cells in vivo remain unclear. In this study, we used mouse models with conditional deletion of the key T cell receptor (TCR)-coupled adaptor molecule SH2-domain-containing phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), to analyze signaling mechanisms for memory CD4 T cell generation, maintenance, and homeostasis. We found that ablation of SLP-76 expression after T cell priming did not inhibit generation of phenotypic effector or memory CD4 T cells; however, the resultant SLP-76-deficient memory CD4 T cells could not produce recall cytokines in response to TCR-mediated stimulation and showed decreased persistence in vivo. In addition, SLP-76-deficient memory CD4 T cells exhibited reduced steady-state homeostasis and were impaired in their ability to homeostatically expand in vivo in response to the gamma(c) cytokine IL-7, despite intact proximal signaling through the IL-7R-coupled JAK3/STAT5 pathway. Direct in vivo deletion of SLP-76 in polyclonal memory CD4 T cells likewise led to impaired steady-state homeostasis as well as impaired homeostatic responses to IL-7. Our findings demonstrate a dominant role for SLP-76-dependent TCR signals in regulating turnover and perpetuation of memory CD4 T cells and their responses to homeostatic cytokines, with implications for the selective survival of memory CD4 T cells following pathogen exposure, vaccination, and aging.",

        "Abstract": "Ligation of TLR by distinct pathogen components provides essential signals for T cell priming, although how individual TLR engagement affects primary and memory T cell responses is not well defined. In this study, we demonstrate distinct effects of TLR2 vs TLR4 engagement on primary and memory CD4 T cell responses due to differential effects on APC. Priming of influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific naive CD4 T cells with HA peptide and the TLR2 agonist Pam3CysK in vivo resulted in a high frequency of activated HA-specific CD4 T cells that predominantly produced IL-2 and IL-17, whereas priming with HA peptide and the TLR4 agonist LPS yielded a lower frequency of HA-specific CD4 T cells and predominant IFN-gamma producers. TLR2 agonist priming depended on TLR2 expression by APC, as wild-type CD4 T cells did not expand in response to peptide and Pam3CysK in TLR2-deficient hosts. TLR2-mediated priming also led to an increased frequency of Ag-specific memory CD4 T cells compared with TLR4 priming and mediated enhanced secondary responses to influenza challenge. Our results show that TLR engagement on APC influences both primary and secondary CD4 T cell responses, and suggest that long-term functional capacities of T cells are set by innate signals during early phases of an infection.",

Modulation of memory T cells is a promising but not yet achieved strategy for inhibiting these deleterious effects. Using an influenza infection model, we demonstrate that memory CD4 T cell-driven secondary responses to influenza challenge result in improved viral clearance yet do not prevent the morbidity associated with viral infection, and they exacerbate cellular recruitment into the lung, compared with primary responses. Inhibiting CD28 costimulation with the approved immunomodulator CTLA4Ig suppressed primary responses in naive mice infected with influenza, but was remarkably curative for memory CD4 T cell-mediated secondary responses to influenza, with reduced immunopathology and enhanced recovery. We demonstrate that CTLA4Ig differentially affects lymphoid and nonlymphoid responses to influenza challenge, inhibiting proliferation and egress of lymphoid naive and memory T cells, while leaving lung-resident memory CD4 T cell responses intact. Our findings reveal the dual nature of memory T cell-mediated secondary responses and suggest costimulation modulation as a novel strategy to optimize antiviral immunity by limiting the memory T cell response to its protective capacities.",

        "Abstract": "The memory immune response forms the basis for protective immunity and is orchestrated by long-lived memory T lymphocytes. Memory T cells mediate potent and rapid effector function upon secondary challenge, and migrate to diverse peripheral sites, resulting in efficacious clearance of pathogens before the onset of disease. However, these robust memory T cell functions and diverse homing capacities can also lead to immunopathology in viral infections, autoimmunity, and transplantation. Elucidating mechanisms controlling memory T cell generation and recall responses therefore has broad clinical and immunological relevance. In this review, we highlight advances in the past year on dissecting the processes of memory generation, recall capacity, and regulation of memory T cell responses. We discuss the past year's studies focused on identifying pathways and precursors for memory development at both the priming and effector stage, and how the earliest events in T cell activation may have far-ranging influences on the resultant memory T cell population. We also describe results on the biochemical and molecular control of the distinct and immediate effector functions of memory T cells and their implications for immunotherapies. Finally, we present recent technological advances in T cell tracking and imagery and how they may be applied to provide new insight into the complex nature of the memory immune response.",

        "Abstract": "The presence of FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) is necessary for control of deleterious immune responses in the steady state; however, mechanisms for maintaining the frequency and quality of endogenous Tregs are not well defined. In this study, we used in vivo modulators of the CD28 and CTLA4 pathways administered to intact mice to reveal mechanisms controlling the homeostasis and phenotype of endogenous Tregs. We demonstrate that expression of the negative costimulatory regulator CTLA4 on FoxP3(+) Tregs in vivo is a direct consequence of their rapid, perpetual homeostasis. Up-regulation of CTLA4 expression occurs only on FoxP3(+) Tregs undergoing extensive proliferation and can be abrogated by inhibiting the CD28 pathway, coinciding with a reduction in FoxP3(+) Treg proliferation and frequency. We further demonstrate that CTLA4 negatively regulates steady-state Treg homeostasis, given that inhibiting CTLA4 signaling with an anti-CTLA4 blocking Ab greatly enhances Treg proliferation and overall Treg frequency. Our findings provide new insight into the origin and role of CTLA4 expression on natural FoxP3(+) Tregs and reveal opposing effects of costimulation modulators on the steady-state level and quality of Tregs, with implications regarding their effects on endogenous Tregs in patients receiving immunotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Memory T cells are generated following an initial viral infection, and have the potential for mediating robust protective immunity to viral re-challenge due to their rapid and enhanced functional responses. In recent years, it has become clear that the memory T cell response to most viruses is remarkably diverse in phenotype, function, and tissue distribution, and can undergo dynamic changes during its long-term maintenance in vivo. However, the role of this variegation and compartmentalizationof memory T cells in protective immunity to viruses remains unclear. In this review,we discuss the diverse features of memory T cells that can delineate different subsets, the characteristics of memory T cells thus far identified to promote protective immune responses, and how the heterogeneous nature of memory T cells may also promote immunopathology during antiviral responses. We propose that given the profound heterogeneity of memory T cells, regulation of memory T cells during secondary responses could focus the response to participation of specific subsets,and/or inhibit memory T-cell subsets and functions that can lead to immunopathology.",

The bone marrow (BM) is a unique microenvironment that supports robust proliferation and recall responses of both \"central\" and \"effector\" memory T cells, particularly within the CD8+ T cell subset. The recent identification within human BM of a population of CD8+ effector memory T cells with hybrid phenotype and enhanced cytotoxic function has important implications for the development of future immunotherapies.

In this study, we present a novel, multiparameter analysis of TCR-coupled signaling and function in resting and activated naive and memory CD4 T cells, revealing a biochemical basis for immunological recall. We identify a striking elevation in expression of the proximal tyrosine kinase Zap70 in resting Ag-specific and polyclonal mouse memory vs naive CD4 T cells that is stably maintained independent of protein synthesis. Elevated Zap70 protein levels control effector function as IFN-gamma production occurs exclusively from the Zap70(high) fraction of activated T cells in vitro and in vivo, and specific down-modulation of Zap70 expression in memory CD4 T cells by small interfering RNA or protein inhibition significantly reduces rapid IFN-gamma production. Downstream of Zap70, we show quantitative differences in distal phosphorylation associated with effector function in naive and memory subsets, with low accumulation of phosphorylation in memory T cells producing IFN-gamma at early time points, contrasting extensive phosphorylation associated with IFN-gamma production following sustained activation of naive T cells. Our results reveal a novel biochemical signature imparted to memory CD4 T cells enabling efficacious responses through increased Zap70 expression and reduced accumulation of downstream signaling events.",

We demonstrate here that alterations in the expression of proximal TCR-coupled signaling subunits are associated with distinct effector capacities in differentiated human CD4 T cells. Analysis of proximal signaling profiles using biochemical and single cell approaches reveals decreased CD3zeta and ZAP-70 expression correlating with functional anergy, with increased CD3zeta/ ZAP-70 expression and phosphorylation connoting acquisition of effector capacity. By contrast, the FcRgamma signaling subunit known to be expressed in human effector cells and in T cells from the autoimmune disease SLE is up-regulated upon activation, yet does not correlate with functional capacity in effector cells, and does not alter signaling or function in primary FcRgamma transfectants. Our results have implications for targeting signaling molecules in immunotherapy and evaluating the functional consequence of signaling alterations associated with autoimmunity and chronic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway is generally considered dispensable for memory T cell responses, largely based on in vitro studies demonstrating memory T cell activation in the absence of CD28 engagement by B7 ligands. However, the susceptibility of memory CD4 T cells, including central (CD62L(high)) and effector memory (T(EM); CD62L(low)) subsets, to inhibition of CD28-derived costimulation has not been closely examined. In this study, we demonstrate that inhibition of CD28/B7 costimulation with the B7-binding fusion molecule CTLA4Ig has profound and specific effects on secondary responses mediated by memory CD4 T cells generated by priming with Ag or infection with influenza virus. In vitro, CTLA4Ig substantially inhibits IL-2, but not IFN-gamma production from heterogeneous memory CD4 T cells specific for influenza hemagglutinin or OVA in response to peptide challenge. Moreover, IL-2 production from polyclonal influenza-specific memory CD4 T cells in response to virus challenge was completely abrogated by CTLA4Ig with IFN-gamma production partially inhibited. When administered in vivo, CTLA4Ig significantly blocks Ag-driven memory CD4 T cell proliferation and expansion, without affecting early recall and activation. Importantly, CTLA4Ig treatment in vivo induced a striking shift in the phenotype of the responding population from predominantly T(EM) in control-treated mice to predominantly central memory T cells in CTLA4Ig-treated mice, suggesting biased effects of CTLA4Ig on T(EM) responses. Our results identify a novel role for CD28/B7 as a regulator of memory T cell responses, and have important clinical implications for using CTLA4Ig to abrogate the pathologic consequences of T(EM) cells in autoimmunity and chronic disease.",

        "Abstract": "Memory T cells are generated following an initial encounter with antigen, persist over the lifetime of an individual, and mediate rapid and robust functional responses upon antigenic recall. While immune memory is generally associated with protective immune response to pathogens, memory T cells can be generated to diverse types of antigens including autoantigens and alloantigens through homologous or crossreactive priming and comprise the majority of circulating T cells during adulthood. Memory T cells can therefore play critical roles in propagating and perpetuating autoimmune disease and in mediating allograft rejection, although the precise pathways for regulation of memory immune responses remain largely undefined. Moreover, evaluating and designing strategies to modulate memory T-cell responses are challenging given the remarkable heterogeneity of memory T cells, with different subsets predominating in lymphoid versus non-lymphoid tissue sites. In this review, we discuss what is presently known regarding the effect of current immunomodulation strategies on the memory T-cell compartment and potential strategies for controlling immunological recall.",

        "Abstract": "Mechanisms for the generation of memory CD4 T cells and their delineation into diverse subsets remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate in two Ag systems, divergent generation of heterogeneous memory CD4 T cells from activated precursors in distinct differentiation stages. Specifically, we show that influenza hemagglutinin- and OVA-specific CD4 T cells activated for 1, 2, and 3 days, respectively, exhibit gradations of differentiation by cell surface phenotype, IFN-gamma production, and proliferation, yet all serve as direct precursors for functional memory CD4 T cells when transferred in vivo into Ag-free mouse hosts. Using a conversion assay to track the immediate fate of activated precursors in vivo, we show that day 1- to 3-activated cells all rapidly convert from an activated phenotype (CD25(high)IL-7R(low)CD44(high)) to a resting memory phenotype (IL-7R(high)CD25(low)CD44(high)) 1 day after antigenic withdrawal. Paradoxically, stable memory subset delineation from undifferentiated (day 1- to 2-activated) precursors was predominantly an effector memory (CD62L(low)) profile, with an increased proportion of central memory (CD62L(high)) T cells arising from more differentiated (day 3-activated) precursors. Our findings support a divergent model for generation of memory CD4 T cells directly from activated precursors in multiple differentiation states, with subset heterogeneity maximized by increased activation and differentiation during priming.",

The linear model for memory T-cell generation from differentiated effector cells has been favored, although there is evidence that memory T cells can emerge directly from naive T cells undergoing homeostatic expansion and from activated T cells lacking effector functions. Here, we discuss the evidence from diverse studies of memory generation that support a new 'intersecting pathway' model for memory T-cell generation in which antigen-driven effector differentiation and homeostasis-driven memory differentiation follow distinct but analogous pathways. Antigen withdrawal during effector differentiation enables intersection with the memory pathway through a pre-memory intermediate, and memory heterogeneity is influenced by homeostasis, migration and persistence in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Memory T cells are heterogeneous in expression of lymph node homing receptors, delineating \"central-memory\" (TCM, CD62Lhi/CCR7+) and \"effector-memory\" (TEM, CD62Llo/CCR7-) subsets that migrate to lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, respectively. It is not known how these subsets arise or how homing receptor expression and tissue origin determine their functional and migratory properties. Here, we investigated the role of CD62L expression in the generation, function, distribution and migration of heterogeneous memory CD4 T cells specific for influenza hemagglutinin (HA). We found that CD62Lhi and CD62Llo memory subsets are generated independent of CD62L expression by the activated precursor, and both subsets distribute into spleen and lung. Functionally, spleen- and lung-derived CD62L memory subsets produce effector cytokines at similar kinetics but differ strikingly in cell surface phenotype and migration: the CD62Llo memory subset expresses a classic memory phenotype (CD45RBlo/CD44hi/CD11a(hi)), while the CD62Lhi subset expresses an unconventional phenotype (CD45RBhi/CD44int/CD11a(int)), defining a new polyclonal memory subset. The CD62Lhi subset also trafficked more efficiently than CD62Llo cells into lymph nodes; however, only lung but not spleen CD62Llo memory T cells homed to lung. Our results reveal novel phenotypic heterogeneity of memory CD4 T cells co-segregating with CD62L expression and tissue-specific tropism of non-lymphoid memory CD4 T cells.",

In this study, we demonstrate that anti-CD3-mediated activation of influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific TCR-transgenic CD4 T cells results in generation of a long-lived HA-specific memory CD4 T cell population when transferred into lymphocyte-deficient and intact mouse hosts. This anti-CD3-primed memory population is indistinguishable from HA peptide-primed memory CD4 T cells in terms of phenotype, rapid recall function, and enhanced proliferative capacity. Moreover, anti-CD3 priming generates phenotypically heterogeneous memory subsets in lymphoid and non-lymphoid sites. Our results suggest that anti-CD3 has potential efficacy in generating memory responses in adoptive immunotherapies and vaccines and that the tissue distribution and maintenance of heterogeneous lymphoid and non-lymphoid memory T cell subsets are a stochastic process that can occur independent of antigen or TCR specificity.",

        "Abstract": "Optimization of long term immunity depends on the functional persistence of memory T cells; however, there are no defined strategies for promoting memory T cell function and survival. In this study, we hypothesized that varying the strength of the recall stimulus could modulate the function and survival potential of memory CD4 T cells. We tested the ability of peptide variants of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) exhibiting strong and weak avidity for an HA-specific TCR, to modulate HA-specific memory CD4 T cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro stimulation with a weak avidity peptide (L115) uncoupled memory CD4 T proliferation from effector cytokine production with low apoptosis, whereas stimulation with a strong avidity peptide (Y117) fully recalled memory T cell functions but triggered increased apoptosis. To determine how differential recall would affect memory T cells in vivo, we boosted BALB/c hosts of transferred, CFSE-labeled HA-specific memory CD4 T cells with native HA, Y117, and L115 variant peptides and found differences in early Ag-driven memory T cell proliferation and IL-7R expression, with subsequent changes in memory T cell yield. High avidity boosting resulted in rapid proliferation, extensive IL-7R down-regulation, and the lowest yield of HA-specific memory cells, whereas low avidity boosting triggered low in vivo proliferation, maintenance of IL-7R expression, and the highest memory T cell yield. Our results indicate that memory CD4 T cell function and survival can be modulated at the recall level, and can be optimized by low level stimulation that minimizes apoptosis and enhances responses to survival factors.",

        "Abstract": "Islet transplantation has great potential for curing type 1 diabetes; however, long-term islet survival using conventional immunosuppression remains elusive. We present a novel strategy for inducing long-lasting islet graft survival in diabetic NOD mice in the absence of posttransplant immunosuppression by initial treatment with antilymphocyte serum (ALS) followed by coadministration of donor pancreatic lymph node cells (PLNCs). When treated with ALS/PLNC, diabetic NOD mice become normoglycemic and tolerated minor antigen-disparate islet grafts for >100 days and syngeneic islet grafts indefinitely. Donor T-cells are required for graft prolongation, and tolerant hosts have long-term donor T-cell chimerism. Strikingly, host autoreactive T-cells from mice with long-surviving islet grafts predominantly produce interleukin-4, whereas autoreactive T-cells from mice that rejected their islet grafts predominantly produce interferon-gamma. We thus demonstrate a clinically relevant approach for ablation of recurrent autoimmunity in islet transplantation, involving donor lymphocyte-driven alteration of pathogenic autoreactive T-cells.",

        "Abstract": "The adaptive immune system is endowed with long-lived memory to recall previous antigen encounters and respond more effectively to them. Memory immune responses are mediated by antigen-specific memory T lymphocytes that exhibit enhanced function compared with naïve T cells that have never encountered antigen. While the generation of memory T cells specific for pathogens is beneficial in providing protective immunity, memory T cells specific for alloantigens can be deleterious to the recipient of a transplanted organ. In graft rejection, memory T cells mediate accelerated, \"second-set\" rejection and their presence has been associated with increased propensity for early rejection. Recent findings have demonstrated that alloreactive memory T cells can be generated via exposure to alloantigens, as well as stimuli that are cross-reactive with alloantigens, and are therefore likely present in \"naïve\" individuals. This review focuses on the characteristics of memory T cells which make them of special interest to the transplant community, including differential activation requirements, broad homing properties, and resistance to tolerance induction. The multiple ways in which memory T cells can contribute to early and late graft rejection are discussed, as well as potential targets for combating alloreactive memory to be considered in the future design of tolerance induction strategies.",

        "Abstract": "It has been difficult to assess the role of specific genes in activation and differentiation of peripheral T cell subsets such as naive, effector and memory T cells due to the impairments in T cell development and immune pathologies often observed in genetically manipulated mouse models, and the lack of reliable methods for introducing genes into primary mouse T cells. In this study, we demonstrate transient transfection of genes into resting and activated mouse CD4 T cell subsets using \"Nucleofection\", a modified electroporation technique. Using this approach, cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) is efficiently taken up and expressed by purified polyclonal and antigen-specific mouse naive, effector and memory CD4 T cells isolated from BALB/c or TCR-transgenic mice. The resultant transfected resting T cells are fully amenable to TCR-mediated activation. We also demonstrate that expression of endogenous gene can be turned on in resting T cells by transfection of a transcriptional transactivator. Our results demonstrate for the first time, the expression of exogenously transfected genes and the modulation of endogenous gene expression in primary mouse T cell subsets. This technology will enable a variety of mechanistic questions on T cell activation, function and signaling to be addressed in T cells that differ in activation history and functional capacities.",

Here we demonstrate that human effector CD4 T cells up-regulate the expression of the CD3zeta-related FcRgamma signaling subunit that becomes part of an altered TCR/CD3 signaling complex containing CD3epsilon, but not CD3zeta. The TCR/CD3/FcRgamma complex in effector cells recruits and activates the Syk, but not the ZAP-70, tyrosine kinase. This physiologic switch in TCR signaling occurs exclusively in effector, and not naive or memory T cells, suggesting a potential target for manipulation of effector responses in autoimmune, malignant, and infectious diseases.",

It is not known whether a given population of antigen-specific memory T cells is endowed with functional flexibility to provide protective responses against antigens reencountered in different immunological contexts. Here, we examine functional properties of influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific memory CD4 T cells recovered from adoptive hosts that received in vitro-activated HA-specific T cell receptor-transgenic CD4 T cells 2 months to 1 year previously. We demonstrate that this HA-specific memory CD4 T cell population bearing a clonal T cell receptor can produce predominantly T helper 1 or T helper 2 effector cytokines depending on the nature of the recall stimulus. Our findings reveal remarkable functional plasticity within an antigen-specific memory T cell population and have direct implications for modulating memory T cell function in vaccine design and treatments for autoimmune diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Memory immune responses are classically attributed to the reactivation of long-lived, antigen-specific T lymphocytes that persist in a quiescent state. Determining mechanisms for the generation of memory T cells and dissecting the functional nature of the memory T cell pool has been encumbered by an inability to distinguish recently activated effector T cells from memory T cells. We have established new activation and biochemical criteria that distinguish effector and memory T cells and have applied these criteria to follow memory generation from activated cells in vivo. We found that the resultant memory T cell pool is heterogeneous and consists of effector-like and resting memory-like subsets that differ in expression of the homing receptor, CD62L. We discuss these findings in the context of memory T cell heterogeneity identified in human and mouse systems. These results suggest that more than one type of previously activated T cell can mediate recall or memory immune responses and that elucidating the fundamental phenotypic and functional features of memory T cell subsets is therefore critical to deciphering the complex nature of the memory immune response.",

        "Title": "Differential SLP-76 expression and TCR-mediated signaling in effector and memory CD4 T cells.",
        "Abstract": "We present in this study novel findings on TCR-mediated signaling in naive, effector, and memory CD4 T cells that identify critical biochemical markers to distinguish these subsets. We demonstrate that relative to naive CD4 T cells, memory CD4 T cells exhibit a profound decrease in expression of the linker/adapter molecule SLP-76, while effector T cells express normal to elevated levels of SLP-76. The reduced level of SLP-76 is memory CD4 T cells is coincident with reduced phosphorylation overall, yet the residual SLP-76 couples to a subset of TCR-associated linker molecules, leading to downstream mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. By contrast, effector CD4 T cells strongly phosphorylate SLP-76, linker for activation of T cells, and additional Grb2-coupled proteins, exhibit increased associations of SLP-76 to phosphorylated linkers, and hyperphosphorylate downstream Erk1/2 MAP kinases. Our results suggest distinct coupling of signaling intermediates to the TCR in naive, effector, and memory CD4 T cells. Whereas effector CD4 T cells amplify existing TCR signaling events accounting for rapid effector responses, memory T cells engage fewer signaling intermediates to efficiently link TCR triggering directly to downstream MAP kinase activation.",
