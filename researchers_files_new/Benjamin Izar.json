        "Abstract": "Sarcoma encompasses a diverse group of cancers that are typically resistant to current therapies, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The contexture of sarcomas limits generation of high-quality data using cutting-edge molecular profiling methods, such as single-cell RNA-seq, thus hampering progress in understanding these understudied cancers.",

        "Abstract": "Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in key T cell genes can drive clinical pathologies and could be repurposed to improve cellular cancer immunotherapies. Here, we perform massively parallel base-editing screens to generate thousands of variants at gene loci annotated with known or potential clinical relevance. We discover a broad landscape of putative gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, including in PIK3CD and the gene encoding its regulatory subunit, PIK3R1, LCK, SOS1, AKT1 and RHOA. Base editing of PIK3CD and PIK3R1 variants in T cells with an engineered T cell receptor specific to a melanoma epitope or in different generations of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells demonstrates that discovered GOF variants, but not LOF or silent mutation controls, enhanced signaling, cytokine production and lysis of cognate melanoma and leukemia cell models, respectively. Additionally, we show that generations of CD19 CAR T cells engineered with PIK3CD GOF mutations demonstrate enhanced antigen-specific signaling, cytokine production and leukemia cell killing, including when benchmarked against other recent strategies.",

This occurs in approximately 5-10% of ICB-treated patients, but has not yet been described in the context of novel combination therapies. Here, we report a case of an 89-year-old patient with metastatic melanoma to the liver, lung and lymph nodes, who underwent treatment with Opdualag (combining anti-PD-1 nivolumab and anti-lymphocyte-activation gene 3 relatlimab ICBs), and developed pseudoprogression after two cycles of therapy. The patient experienced a radiographic increase in liver metastatic lesion size, but was found to have a subsequent reduction in these lesions. The patient has been on therapy for 18 months without evidence of disease progression and continues to be clinically well-appearing.",

        "Abstract": "Liver metastasis (LM) confers poor survival and therapy resistance across cancer types, but the mechanisms of liver-metastatic organotropism remain unknown. Here, through in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we found that Pip4k2c loss conferred LM but had no impact on lung metastasis or primary tumor growth. Pip4k2c-deficient cells were hypersensitized to insulin-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling and exploited the insulin-rich liver milieu for organ-specific metastasis. We observed concordant changes in PIP4K2C expression and distinct metabolic changes in 3,511 patient melanomas, including primary tumors, LMs and lung metastases. We found that systemic PI3K inhibition exacerbated LM burden in mice injected with Pip4k2c-deficient cancer cells through host-mediated increase in hepatic insulin levels; however, this circuit could be broken by concurrent administration of an SGLT2 inhibitor or feeding of a ketogenic diet. Thus, this work demonstrates a rare example of metastatic organotropism through co-optation of physiological metabolic cues and proposes therapeutic avenues to counteract these mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer, yet the underlying mechanisms are often unknown in many patients. Using single-cell transcriptomics analysis, we previously identified the co-stimulator CD58 as part of a cancer cell-intrinsic immune checkpoint resistance signature in patient melanoma tissue. We subsequently validated CD58 loss as a driver of immune evasion using a patient-derived co-culture model of cancer and cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in a pooled single-cell perturbation experiment, where we additionally observed concurrent upregulation of PD-L1 protein expression in melanoma cells with CD58 loss. In our most recent study, we uncovered the mechanisms of immune evasion mediated by CD58 loss, including impaired T cell activation and infiltration within tumors, as well as inhibitory signaling by PD-L1 via a shared regulator, CMTM6. Thus, cancer cell-intrinsic reduction of CD58 represents a multi-faceted determinant of immune evasion. Furthermore, its reciprocal interaction with PD-L1 via CMTM6 provides critical insights into how co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune cues are regulated.",

To thoroughly characterize the temporal nature of antitumor immune responses, we developed a 34-parameter spectral flow cytometry panel and performed high-throughput analyses in critical contexts. We leveraged two distinct preclinical models that recapitulate cancer immunoediting (NPK-C1) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response (MC38), respectively, and profiled multiple relevant tissues at and around key inflection points of immune surveillance and escape and/or ICB response. Machine learning-driven data analysis revealed a pattern of KLRG1 expression that uniquely identified intratumoral effector CD4 T cell populations that constitutively associate with tumor burden across tumor models, and are lost in tumors undergoing regression in response to ICB.

        "Abstract": "The cell-autonomous balance of immune-inhibitory and -stimulatory signals is a critical process in cancer immune evasion. Using patient-derived co-cultures, humanized mouse models, and single-cell RNA-sequencing of patient melanomas biopsied before and on immune checkpoint blockade, we find that intact cancer cell-intrinsic expression of CD58 and ligation to CD2 is required for anti-tumor immunity and is predictive of treatment response. Defects in this axis promote immune evasion through diminished T cell activation, impaired intratumoral T cell infiltration and proliferation, and concurrently increased PD-L1 protein stabilization. Through CRISPR-Cas9 and proteomics screens, we identify and validate CMTM6 as critical for CD58 stability and upregulation of PD-L1 upon CD58 loss. Competition between CD58 and PD-L1 for CMTM6 binding determines their rate of endosomal recycling over lysosomal degradation. Overall, we describe an underappreciated yet critical axis of cancer immunity and provide a molecular basis for how cancer cells balance immune inhibitory and stimulatory cues.",

To thoroughly characterize the temporal nature of antitumor immune responses, we developed a 34-parameter spectral flow cytometry panel and performed high-throughput analyses in critical contexts. We leveraged two distinct preclinical models that recapitulate cancer immunoediting (NPK-C1) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response (MC38), respectively, and profiled multiple relevant tissues at and around key inflection points of immune surveillance and escape and/or ICB response. Machine learning-driven data analysis revealed a pattern of KLRG1 expression that uniquely identified intratumoral effector CD4 T cell populations that constitutively associate with tumor burden across tumor models, and are lost in tumors undergoing regression in response to ICB.

        "Abstract": "Melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) frequently occurs in patients with advanced melanoma; yet, our understanding of the underlying salient biology is rudimentary. Here, we performed single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq in 22 treatment-naive MBMs and 10 extracranial melanoma metastases (ECMs) and matched spatial single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor (TCR)-seq. Cancer cells from MBM were more chromosomally unstable, adopted a neuronal-like cell state, and enriched for spatially variably expressed metabolic pathways. Key observations were validated in independent patient cohorts, patient-derived MBM/ECM xenograft models, RNA/ATAC-seq, proteomics, and multiplexed imaging. Integrated spatial analyses revealed distinct geography of putative cancer immune evasion and evidence for more abundant intra-tumoral B to plasma cell differentiation in lymphoid aggregates in MBM. MBM harbored larger fractions of monocyte-derived macrophages and dysfunctional TOX",

To elucidate underlying mechanisms, we developed Perturb-CITE-sequencing (Perturb-CITE-seq), enabling pooled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 perturbations with single-cell transcriptome and protein readouts. In patient-derived melanoma cells and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) co-cultures, we profiled transcriptomes and 20 proteins in ~218,000 cells under ~750 perturbations associated with cancer cell-intrinsic ICI resistance (ICR). We recover known mechanisms of resistance, including defects in the interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-JAK/STAT and antigen-presentation pathways in RNA, protein and perturbation space, and new ones, including loss/downregulation of CD58. Loss of CD58 conferred immune evasion in multiple co-culture models and was downregulated in tumors of melanoma patients with ICR. CD58 protein expression was not induced by IFN-γ signaling, and CD58 loss conferred immune evasion without compromising major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, suggesting that it acts orthogonally to known mechanisms of ICR. This work provides a framework for the deciphering of complex mechanisms by large-scale perturbation screens with multimodal, single-cell readouts, and discovers potentially clinically relevant mechanisms of immune evasion.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the success of immune checkpoint blockade as a strategy for activating an antitumor immune response and promoting cancer regression, only a subset of patients have durable clinical benefit. Efforts are ongoing to identify robust biomarkers that can effectively predict treatment response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Although PD-L1 expression is useful for stratifying patients, it is an imperfect tool. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing platforms that are readily used in clinical practice to identify a tumor's potentially actionable genetic alterations also reveal tumor genomic features, including tumor mutation burden (TMB), that may impact the response to ICIs. High TMB enhances tumor immunogenicity through increased numbers of tumor neoantigens that may promote an immune response. Defective DNA repair, leading to microsatellite instability, is an endogenous mechanism for increased tumor TMB that augments response to anti-PD-1 blockade. Alternatively, DNA damage from exogenous factors is responsible for high TMB seen in melanoma, lung cancer, and urothelial carcinoma, among tumor subtypes with higher response rates to ICIs. In this review, we summarize data supporting the use of TMB as a biomarker as well as its known limitations. We also highlight specific tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that are under investigation as biomarkers for ICI response and resistance. Efforts are ongoing to delineate which genomic tumor characteristics can eventually be utilized in clinical practice to ascertain the benefit of ICIs for an individual patient.",

New drugs that control tumor growth and favorably modulate the immune environment are therefore needed. We report that the small-molecule CX-6258 has potent activity against both RMi-sensitive (RMS) and -resistant (RMR) melanoma cell lines. Haspin kinase (HASPIN) was identified as a target of CX-6258. HASPIN inhibition resulted in reduced proliferation, frequent formation of micronuclei, recruitment of cGAS, and activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. In murine models, CX-6258 induced a potent cGAS-dependent type-I IFN response in tumor cells, increased IFNγ-producing CD8",

        "Abstract": "The use of either immune checkpoint blockade or RAF/MEK inhibitors represents standard of care treatment options for metastatic melanoma. Each class of these drugs has distinct response kinetics, adverse effects, and unique clinical challenges. Combination of immune checkpoint blockade and RAF/MEK inhibitors may result in rapid and durable responses, however, the potential adverse effects of such combinations are poorly characterized. Here, we describe the case of a patient with BRAF-mutant melanoma who received an initial infusion of anti-PD-1 therapy while taking RAF/MEK inhibitors and experienced severe acute kidney injury, an otherwise infrequent side effect of any of these drugs alone. Treatment with corticosteroids rapidly reversed this process, indicating an underlying immune-mediated complication. A deeper understanding of potential adverse effects of combination therapies and their potential mechanisms should be carefully considered in the treatment landscape for melanoma and other cancers.",

        "Abstract": "Balancing the potential for durable remissions with autoimmune-like toxicities is a key clinical challenge in the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Certain toxicities are associated with an increased response rate; however, the molecular underpinnings of this association are poorly understood. Here, we report a patient with wide spread uveal melanoma who had an exceptional response to treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab, but suffered severe immune-related sequelae, including central serous retinopathy with retinal detachment, tinnitus, and vitiligo resembling Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, and refractory enteritis. TCR-sequencing of the primary tumor, a hepatic metastasis, duodenal biopsy and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, identified the identical T cell clone in all four tissues. This case provides preliminary evidence for cross-reactivity as a mechanism for the association between effect and toxicity of ICIs.",

        "Abstract": "The development of a new lesion in a patient with a complete remission to anti-PD-1 therapy is highly concerning for a drug resistant escape lesion. Here, we present a case of a 62-year-old patient with chemotherapy-resistant metastatic urothelial cancer who had a complete remission to pembrolizumab. The patient's disease burden tracked closely to serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) expressed by the tumor and served as an accurate tumor marker. Surveillance imaging revealed a solitary growing pulmonary nodule mimicking an escape lesion in the absence of an increase in AFP levels. Biopsy of this lesion revealed a benign intraparenchymal lymph node with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. This case indicates that in some patients, biomarkers aberrantly expressed by their tumors, such as AFP in this patient, may be used as a tumor marker for response to anti-PD-1 therapy and emphasizes the importance of confirming potential escape lesions by pathologic examination.",

        "Abstract": "The architecture of normal and diseased tissues strongly influences the development and progression of disease as well as responsiveness and resistance to therapy. We describe a tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) method for highly multiplexed immuno-fluorescence imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens mounted on glass slides, the most widely used specimens for histopathological diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. t-CyCIF generates up to 60-plex images using an iterative process (a cycle) in which conventional low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and then assembled into a high-dimensional representation. t-CyCIF requires no specialized instruments or reagents and is compatible with super-resolution imaging; we demonstrate its application to quantifying signal transduction cascades, tumor antigens and immune markers in diverse tissues and tumors. The simplicity and adaptability of t-CyCIF makes it an effective method for pre-clinical and clinical research and a natural complement to single-cell genomics.",

Photoaging desktop programs, in which an image is altered to predict future appearance, have been successful in positively influencing behavior in adiposity or tobacco prevention settings.",

        "Abstract": "To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), safety profile, and anti-tumor efficacy of RAF265. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, phase-I, dose-escalation trial of RAF265, an orally available RAF kinase/VEGFR-2 inhibitor, in patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, pharmacodynamics (PD) and tumor response assessment were conducted. We evaluated metabolic tumor response by 18[F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET), tissue biomarkers using immunohistochemistry (IHC), and modulators of angiogenesis. RAF265 has a serum half-life of approximately 200 h. The MTD was 48 mg once daily given continuously. Among 77 patients, most common treatment-related adverse effects were fatigue (52%), diarrhea (34%), weight loss (31%) and vitreous floaters (27%). Eight of 66 evaluable patients (12.1%) had an objective response, including seven partial and one complete response. Responses occurred in BRAF-mutant and BRAF wild-type (WT) patients. Twelve of 58 (20.7%) evaluable patients had a partial metabolic response. On-treatment versus pretreatment IHC staining in 23 patients showed dose-dependent p-ERK inhibition. We observed a significant temporal increase in placental growth factor levels and decrease in soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (sVEGFR-2) levels in all dose levels. RAF265 is an oral RAF/VEGFR-2 inhibitor that produced antitumor responses, metabolic responses, and modulated angiogenic growth factor levels. Antitumor activity occurred in patients with BRAF-mutant and BRAF-WT disease. Despite low activity at tolerable doses, this study provides a framework for the development of pan-RAF inhibitors and modulators of angiogenesis for the treatment of melanoma.",

        "Abstract": "Homeostatic programs balance immune protection and self-tolerance. Such mechanisms likely impact autoimmunity and tumor formation, respectively. How homeostasis is maintained and impacts tumor surveillance is unknown. Here, we find that different immune mononuclear phagocytes share a conserved steady-state program during differentiation and entry into healthy tissue. IFNγ is necessary and sufficient to induce this program, revealing a key instructive role. Remarkably, homeostatic and IFNγ-dependent programs enrich across primary human tumors, including melanoma, and stratify survival. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reveals enrichment of homeostatic modules in monocytes and DCs from human metastatic melanoma. Suppressor-of-cytokine-2 (SOCS2) protein, a conserved program transcript, is expressed by mononuclear phagocytes infiltrating primary melanoma and is induced by IFNγ. SOCS2 limits adaptive anti-tumoral immunity and DC-based priming of T cells in vivo, indicating a critical regulatory role. These findings link immune homeostasis to key determinants of anti-tumoral immunity and escape, revealing co-opting of tissue-specific immune development in the tumor microenvironment.",

        "Abstract": "Immunotherapies and targeted therapies for the treatment of metastatic or advanced melanoma produce unique patterns of antitumor response. Conventional outcome measures, such as median progression-free and overall survival, may not be ideally suited to identify all patients who derive a benefit from such therapies. Therefore, the introduction of additional endpoint measures, such as milestone comparisons, may be necessary to characterize the potential benefit of such treatment approaches. Immune checkpoint inhibitors induce durable responses in a portion of patients that may continue after treatment cessation. Measuring the associated treatment-free interval, treatment-free survival, and associated patient-reported outcomes could provide important information when implemented in prospective clinical trials. In this article, we discuss the limitations of current endpoint measures and the potential advantage of using novel endpoints and how these might be used in designing clinical trials to address critical unanswered questions for patients with metastatic melanoma.",

        "Abstract": "Treatment of BRAF-mutant melanomas with MAP kinase pathway inhibitors is paradigmatic of the promise of precision cancer therapy but also highlights problems with drug resistance that limit patient benefit. We use live-cell imaging, single-cell analysis, and molecular profiling to show that exposure of tumor cells to RAF/MEK inhibitors elicits a heterogeneous response in which some cells die, some arrest, and the remainder adapt to drug. Drug-adapted cells up-regulate markers of the neural crest (e.g., NGFR), a melanocyte precursor, and grow slowly. This phenotype is transiently stable, reverting to the drug-naïve state within 9 days of drug withdrawal. Transcriptional profiling of cell lines and human tumors implicates a c-Jun/ECM/FAK/Src cascade in de-differentiation in about one-third of cell lines studied; drug-induced changes in c-Jun and NGFR levels are also observed in xenograft and human tumors. Drugs targeting the c-Jun/ECM/FAK/Src cascade as well as BET bromodomain inhibitors increase the maximum effect (E",

        "Abstract": "For the last five decades, measuring the ability of cells to grow in soft agar has served as the gold standard assay for in vitro cellular transformation. Nevertheless, the soft agar colony formation assay is time consuming and ill-suited for high-throughput screens. This unit describes an equally qualitative and quantitative assay known as growth in low attachment or GILA. The GILA assay is suitable for high-throughput pharmacological or genetic screens and allows the simultaneous examination of multiple cell lines and experimental perturbations. GILA conditions are specific and relevant to the transformed state because they depend on a property of cancer cells that is not shared by non-transformed cells. The GILA assay enables ex vivo drug sensitivity testing of patient-derived tumor cells to define precise treatments for individual patients. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

        "Abstract": "Tumor-stroma interactions are critical for epithelial-derived tumors, and among the stromal cell types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) exhibit multiple functions that fuel growth, dissemination, and drug resistance. However, these interactions remain insufficiently characterized in non-epithelial tumors such as malignant melanoma. We generated monocultures of melanoma cells and matching CAFs from patients' metastatic lesions, distinguished by oncogenic drivers and immunoblotting of characteristic markers. RNA sequencing of CAFs revealed a homogenous epigenetic program that strongly resembled the signatures from epithelial cancers, including enrichment for an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Melanoma CAFs in monoculture displayed robust invasive behavior while patient-derived melanoma monocultures showed very little invasiveness. Instead, melanoma cells showed increased invasion when co-cultured with CAFs. In turn, CAFs showed increased proliferation when exposed to melanoma conditioned media (CM), mediated in part by melanoma-secreted transforming growth factor-alpha that acted on CAFs via the epidermal growth factor receptor. This study provides evidence that bidirectional interactions between melanoma and CAFs regulate progression of metastatic melanoma.",

Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Colony formation in soft agar is the gold-standard assay for cellular transformation in vitro, but it is unsuited for high-throughput screening. Here, we describe an assay for cellular transformation that involves growth in low attachment (GILA) conditions and is strongly correlated with the soft-agar assay. Using GILA, we describe high-throughput screens for drugs and genes that selectively inhibit or increase transformation, but not proliferation. Such molecules are unlikely to be found through conventional drug screening, and they include kinase inhibitors and drugs for noncancer diseases. In addition to known oncogenes, the genetic screen identifies genes that contribute to cellular transformation. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of Food and Drug Administration-approved noncancer drugs to selectively kill ovarian cancer cells derived from patients with chemotherapy-resistant disease, suggesting this approach may provide useful information for personalized cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive human-pathogen bacterium that served as an experimental model for investigating fundamental processes of adaptive immunity and virulence. Recent novel technologies allowed the identification of several hundred non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the Listeria genome and provided insight into an unexpected complex transcriptional machinery. In this review, we discuss ncRNAs that are encoded on the opposite strand of the target gene and are therefore termed antisense RNAs (asRNAs). We highlight mechanistic and functional concepts of asRNAs in L. monocytogenes and put these in context of asRNAs in other bacteria. Understanding asRNAs will further broaden our knowledge of RNA-mediated gene regulation and may provide targets for diagnostic and antimicrobial development.",

In the last decade, a number of targeted cancer therapies have been discovered and proven effective in a variety of hematological and solid malignancies. In this article, we review clinical pharmacokinetic characteristics of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted therapies and provide an overview of key clinical trials that led to approval of these drugs. The major limiting factor of targeted treatment is the development of resistance. We describe general principles of resistance and specific, clinically confirmed mechanisms of resistance to several therapies in different malignancies.",

        "Title": "microRNA response to Listeria monocytogenes infection in epithelial cells.",
        "Abstract": "microRNAs represent a family of very small non-coding RNAs that control several physiologic and pathologic processes, including host immune response and cancer by antagonizing a number of target mRNAs. There is limited knowledge about cell expression and the regulatory role of microRNAs following bacterial infections. We investigated whether infection with a Gram-positive bacterium leads to altered expression of microRNAs involved in the host cell response in epithelial cells. Caco-2 cells were infected with Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e, a mutant strain (ΔinlAB or Δhly) or incubated with purified listeriolysin (LLO). Total RNA was isolated and microRNA and target gene expression was compared to the expression in non-infected cells using microRNA microarrays and qRT-PCR. We identified and validated five microRNAs (miR- 146b, miR-16, let-7a1, miR-145 and miR-155) that were significantly deregulated following listerial infection. We show that expression patterns of particular microRNAs strongly depend on pathogen localization and the presence of bacterial effector proteins. Strikingly, miR-155 which was shown to have an important role in inflammatory responses during infection was induced by wild-type bacteria, by LLO-deficient bacteria and following incubation with purified LLO. It was downregulated following ΔinlAB infection indicating a new potent role for internalins in listerial pathogenicity and miRNA regulation. Concurrently, we observed differences in target transcript expression of the investigated miRNAs. We provide first evidence that L. monocytogenes infection leads to deregulation of a set of microRNAs with important roles in host response. Distinct microRNA expression depends on both LLO and pathogen localization.",

        "Abstract": "Bacterial regulatory non-coding RNAs control numerous mRNA targets that direct a plethora of biological processes, such as the adaption to environmental changes, growth and virulence. Recently developed high-throughput techniques, such as genomic tiling arrays and RNA-Seq have allowed investigating prokaryotic cis- and trans-acting regulatory RNAs, including sRNAs, asRNAs, untranslated regions (UTR) and riboswitches. As a result, we obtained a more comprehensive view on the complexity and plasticity of the prokaryotic genome biology. Listeria monocytogenes was utilized as a model system for intracellular pathogenic bacteria in several studies, which revealed the presence of about 180 regulatory RNAs in the listerial genome. A regulatory role of non-coding RNAs in survival, virulence and adaptation mechanisms of L. monocytogenes was confirmed in subsequent experiments, thus, providing insight into a multifaceted modulatory function of RNA/mRNA interference. In this review, we discuss the identification of regulatory RNAs by high-throughput techniques and in their functional role in L. monocytogenes.",
