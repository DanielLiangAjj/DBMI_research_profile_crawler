        "Abstract": "Recent advances in human genomics technologies have helped uncover genetic risk alleles for many complex autoimmune diseases. Intriguingly, over 90% of genome-wide association study (GWAS) risk alleles reside within the non-coding regions of the genome. An emerging new frontier of functional and mechanistic studies have shed light on the functional relevance of risk alleles that lie within long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here, we review the mechanisms and functional implications of five evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs that display risk allele association with highly prevalent autoimmune diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The NF-κB family of transcription factors and the Ras family of small GTPases are important mediators of proproliferative signaling that drives tumorigenesis and carcinogenesis. The κB-Ras proteins were previously shown to inhibit both NF-κB and Ras activation through independent mechanisms, implicating them as tumor suppressors with potentially broad relevance to human cancers. In this study, we have used two mouse models to establish the relevance of the κB-Ras proteins for tumorigenesis. Additionally, we have utilized a pan-cancer bioinformatics analysis to explore the role of the κB-Ras proteins in human cancers. Surprisingly, we find that the genes encoding κB-Ras 1 (",

        "Title": "L-RAPiT: A Cloud-Based Computing Pipeline for the Analysis of Long-Read RNA Sequencing Data.",
        "Abstract": "Long-read sequencing (LRS) has been adopted to meet a wide variety of research needs, ranging from the construction of novel transcriptome annotations to the rapid identification of emerging virus variants. Amongst other advantages, LRS preserves more information about RNA at the transcript level than conventional high-throughput sequencing, including far more accurate and quantitative records of splicing patterns. New studies with LRS datasets are being published at an exponential rate, generating a vast reservoir of information that can be leveraged to address a host of different research questions. However, mining such publicly available data in a tailored fashion is currently not easy, as the available software tools typically require familiarity with the command-line interface, which constitutes a significant obstacle to many researchers. Additionally, different research groups utilize different software packages to perform LRS analysis, which often prevents a direct comparison of published results across different studies. To address these challenges, we have developed the Long-Read Analysis Pipeline for Transcriptomics (L-RAPiT), a user-friendly, free pipeline requiring no dedicated computational resources or bioinformatics expertise. L-RAPiT can be implemented directly through Google Colaboratory, a system based on the open-source Jupyter notebook environment, and allows for the direct analysis of transcriptomic reads from Oxford Nanopore and PacBio LRS machines. This new pipeline enables the rapid, convenient, and standardized analysis of publicly available or newly generated LRS datasets.",

        "Abstract": "Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many loci contributing to genetic variation of complex traits. Immune mediated disorders are complex diseases for which hundreds of risk alleles have been identified by GWAS. However, the intergenic location of most of the signals has make it difficult to decipher their implication in disease pathogenesis. A significant number of immune disease-associated SNPs are located within long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs have gained importance due to their involvement in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes, including immune responses. GWAS SNPs located within lncRNAs can affect their regulatory capacity by modifying their secondary structure, altering their expression levels or regulating the transcription of different isoforms. In this review we discuss the functional implications of immune-related lncRNAs harboring disease associated SNPs on various disease conditions.",

        "Title": "Metformin selectively dampens the acute inflammatory response through an AMPK-dependent mechanism.",
        "Abstract": "Metformin is a first-line drug in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to its antigluconeogenic and insulin-sensitizing properties, metformin has emerged as a potent inhibitor of the chronic inflammatory response of macrophages. In particular, metformin treatment has been shown to reduce expression of interleukin (IL-) 1β during long-term exposure to the pro-inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which decreases the levels of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1-α, and through enhanced expression of IL-10. However, the effect of metformin on the acute inflammatory response, before significant levels of ROS accumulate in the cell, has not been explored. Here, we show that metformin alters the acute inflammatory response through its activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but independently of HIF1-α and IL-10, in primary macrophages and two macrophage-like cell lines. Thus, metformin changes the acute and the chronic inflammatory response through fundamentally distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis reveals that metformin pretreatment affects the levels of a large yet selective subset of inflammatory genes, dampening the response to short-term LPS exposure and affecting a wide range of pathways and biological functions. Taken together, these findings reveal an unexpected complexity in the anti-inflammatory properties of this widely used drug.",

Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is a pleiotropic kinase that acts as a key effector downstream of PI3K in many cell types. In T cells, PDK1 has been shown to be critical for activation of NF-κB and AKT signaling upon TCR ligation and is therefore essential for effector T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. Using Treg cell-specific conditional deletion, we now demonstrate that PDK1 is also essential for Treg cell suppressive activity in vivo. Ablation of ",

        "Abstract": "Origin of drug and radio-refractory clones, cancer stem-like cells, and rapid angiogenesis and metastasis are among the primary concerns that limit the efficacy of anticancer treatments, emphasizing the urgency of developing new therapeutics. Factors like high attrition rates, huge investments, patients' heterogeneity, and diverse molecular subtypes have challenged the rapid development of anticancer drugs. Treatment with repurposing pleiotropic benzimidazole antihelminthics, like mebendazole, albendazole, and flubendazole has recently opened a new window, owing to their easy access, low cost as a generic drug, and long track record of safe use in the human population. This review highlights the outcomes of preclinical and clinical studies of these drugs as a potent anticancer agent(s) conducted in the last two decades. Substantial preclinical studies, as well as limited clinical trials, suggest noteworthy anticancer potency of these pleiotropic benzimidazoles, particularly as potent microtubule disrupting, anti-angiogenic, and anti-metastatic agents, inhibitors of the immune checkpoint, hypoxia-inducible factor, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer stemness, and multidrug resistance protein 1, and inducers of apoptosis and M1 polarization. These anticancer effects are attributed to multiple action points, including intrinsic apoptosis, canonical Wnt/β-catenin, JAK/STAT-3, JNK, MEK/ERK, and hedgehog signaling pathways. The effective anticancer properties of mebendazole, albendazole, and flubendazole either alone or synergistically with frontline drugs, warrant their validation through controlled clinical trials to use them as promising avenues to anticancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Sterile inflammation contributes to many pathological states associated with mitochondrial injury. Mitochondrial injury disrupts calcium homeostasis and results in the release of CpG-rich mitochondrial DNA. The role of CpG-stimulated TLR9 innate immune signalling and sterile inflammation is well studied; however, how calcium dyshomeostasis affects this signalling is unknown. Therefore, we interrogated the relationship beτween intracellular calcium and CpG-induced TLR9 signalling in murine macrophages. We found that CpG-ODN-induced NFκB-dependent IL1α and IL1β expression was significantly attenuated by both calcium chelation and calcineurin inhibition, a finding mediated by inhibition of degradation of the NFκB inhibitory protein IκBβ. In contrast, calcium ionophore exposure increased CpG-induced IκBβ degradation and IL1α and IL1β expression. These results demonstrate that through its effect on IκBβ degradation, increased intracellular Ca",

        "Abstract": "The global biodiversity of domesticated red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) is gradually eroding by replacement with commercial poultry breeds and results loss of valuable genetic and physical traits like resistance to disease, extreme environment, etc. posing a threat to the poultry genetic resources. Very fewer reports exist on Indian poultry diversity, especially native chicken of India. Therefore, species identification and inventorying of the poultry genetic resource is indispensable. Thus, the present study aimed to characterize indigenous chicken from bio-diversity hotspot of Sunderban and Northeast India using DNA sequence based barcoding approach. A total of 15 CO1 (Cytochrome c Oxidase-I) DNA barcode of different indigenous chicken were newly sequenced along with 6 previously published sequences from our laboratory and compared with the available data of distinctive genera of Phasianidae as per the standard protocol and are identified as Gallus gallus. About 98.96% of the Phasianid birds were successfully delimitated into the respective species except for 12 congeneric pairs whose minimum interspecific K2P (Kimura 2-parameter) distance overlaps with the maximum intraspecific distance (3.9%). The least genetic divergence is observed between G. gallus and G. varius (0.013%) and highest between G. gallus and G. lafayettei (0.059%). The NJ tree showed a cohesive clustering of indigenous chicken with G. gallus and distinct with respect to all the different species under study, thereby revealing their taxonomic position except for few G. sonneratti that showed mixed clustering with G. gallus. This may be due to the genetic introgression between the species. Nevertheless, the study for the first time provided the molecular identification tag of indigenous poultry from biodiversity hotspot of East and Northeast India and will remain as a potential guide to recognize inimitable and valuable poultry genetic resources for future needs.",

        "Abstract": "Immune-mediated diseases, such as celiac disease, type 1 diabetes or multiple sclerosis, are a clinically heterogeneous group of diseases that share many key genetic triggers. Although the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the development of immune mediated disorders is not totally understood, high-throughput genomic studies, such as GWAS and Immunochip, performed in the past few years have provided intriguing hints about underlying mechanisms and pathways that lead to disease. More than a hundred gene variants associated with disease susceptibility have been identified through such studies, but the progress toward understanding the underlying mechanisms has been slow. The majority of the identified risk variants are located in non-coding regions of the genome making it difficult to assign a molecular function to the SNPs. However, recent studies have revealed that many of the non-coding regions bearing disease-associated SNPs generate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs have been implicated in several inflammatory diseases, and many of them have been shown to function as regulators of gene expression. Many of the disease associated SNPs located in lncRNAs modify their secondary structure, or influence expression levels, thereby affecting their regulatory function, hence contributing to the development of disease.",

        "Title": "Association of DFNA5, SYK, and NELL1 variants along with HPV infection in oral cancer among the prolonged tobacco-chewers.",
        "Abstract": "Southeast Asia, especially India, is well known for the highest use of smokeless tobacco. These products are known to induce oral squamous cell carcinoma. However, not all long-term tobacco-chewers develop oral squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, germline variants play a crucial role in susceptibility, prognosis, development, and progression of the disease. These prompted us to study the genetic susceptibility to oral squamous cell carcinoma among the long-term tobacco-chewers. Here, we presented a retrospective study on prolonged tobacco-chewers of Northeast India to identify the potential protective or risk-associated germline variants in tobacco-related oral squamous cell carcinoma along with HPV infection. Targeted re-sequencing (n = 60) of 170 genetic regions from 75 genes was carried out in Ion-PGM™ and validation (n = 116) of the observed variants was done using Sequenom iPLEX MassARRAY™ platform followed by polymerase chain reaction-based HPV genotyping and p16-immunohistochemistry study. Subsequently, estimation of population structure, different statistical and in silico approaches were undertaken. We identified one nonsense-mediated mRNA decay transcript variant in the DFNA5 region (rs2237306), associated with Benzo(a)pyrene, as a protective factor (odds ratio = 0.33; p = 0.009) and four harmful (odds ratio > 2.5; p < 0.05) intronic variants, rs182361, rs290974, and rs169724 in SYK and rs1670661 in NELL1 region, involved in genetic susceptibility to tobacco- and HPV-mediated oral oncogenesis. Among the oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, 12.6% (11/87) were HPV positive, out of which 45.5% (5/11) were HPV16-infected, 27.3% (3/11) were HPV18-infected, and 27.3% (3/11) had an infection of both subtypes. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis showed that the interactions among HPV and NELL1 variant rs1670661 with age and gender augmented the risk of both non-tobacco- and tobacco-related oral squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. These suggest that HPV infection may be one of the important risk factors for oral squamous cell carcinoma in this population. Finally, we newly report a DFNA5 variant probably conferring protection via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway against tobacco-related oral squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, the analytical approach used here can be useful in predicting the population-specific significant variants associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma in any heterogeneous population.",

        "Title": "Assessment of DNA repair susceptibility genes identified by whole exome sequencing in head and neck cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Head and neck cancer (HNC), the sixth most common cancer globally, stands second in India. In Northeast (NE) India, it is the sixth most common cause of death in males and seventh in females. Prolonged tobacco and alcohol consumption constitute the major etiological factors for HNC development, which induce DNA damage. Therefore, DNA repair pathway is a crucial system in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing carcinogenesis. The present work was aimed to predict the consequence of significant germline variants of the DNA repair genes in disease predisposition. Whole exome sequencing was performed in Ion Proton™ platform on 15 case-control samples from the HNC-prevalent states of Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Variant annotation was done in Ion Reporter™ as well as wANNOVAR. Subsequent statistical and bioinformatics analysis identified significant exonic and intronic variants associated with HNC. Amongst our observed variants, 78.6% occurred in ExAC, 94% reported in dbSNP and 5.8% & 9.3% variants were present in ClinVar and HGMD, respectively. The total variants were dispersed among 199 genes with DSBR and FA pathway being the most mutated pathways. The allelic association test suggested that the intronic variants in HLTF and RAD52 gene significantly associated (P < 0.05) with the risk (OR > 5), while intronic variants in PARP4, RECQL5, EXO1 and PER1 genes and exonic variant in TDP2 gene showed protection (OR < 1) for HNC. MDR analysis proposed the exonic variants in MSH6, BRCA2, PALB2 and TP53 genes and intronic variant in RECQL5 genetic region working together during certain phase of DNA repair mechanism for HNC causation. In addition, other intronic and 3'UTR variations caused modifications in the transcription factor binding sites and miRNA target sites associated with HNC. Large-scale validation in NE Indian population, in-depth structure prediction and subsequent simulation of our recognized polymorphisms is necessary to identify true causal variants related to HNC.",

        "Abstract": "ECSIT is a mitochondrial complex I (CI)-associated protein that has been shown to regulate the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) following engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We have generated an Ecsit conditional knockout (CKO) mouse strain to study the in vivo role of ECSIT. ECSIT deletion results in profound alteration of macrophage metabolism, leading to a striking shift to reliance on glycolysis, complete disruption of CI activity, and loss of the CI holoenzyme and multiple subassemblies. An increase in constitutive mROS production in ECSIT-deleted macrophages prevents further TLR-induced mROS production. Surprisingly, ECSIT-deleted cells accumulate damaged mitochondria because of defective mitophagy. ECSIT associates with the mitophagy regulator PINK1 and exhibits Parkin-dependent ubiquitination. However, upon ECSIT deletion, we observed increased mitochondrial Parkin without the expected increase in mitophagy. Taken together, these results demonstrate a key role of ECSIT in CI function, mROS production, and mitophagy-dependent mitochondrial quality control.",

        "Abstract": "The conventional method of measuring biomarkers in malignant tissue samples has already given subversive growth in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy selection. However, the regression and heterogeneity associated with tumor tissue biopsy have urged for the development of an alternative approach. Considering the limitations, cell-free DNA has emerged as a surrogate alternative, facilitating preoperative chemoradiotherapy (p < 0.0001) treatment response in rectal cancer and detection of biomarker in lung cancer. This potential of cell-free DNA in several other cancers has yet to be explored based on clinical relevance by optimizing the preanalytical factors. This review has highlighted the crucial parameters from blood collection to cell-free DNA analysis that has a significant impact on the accuracy and reliability of clinical data. The quantity of cell-free DNA is also a limiting factor. Therefore, a proper preanalytical factor for blood collection, its stability, centrifugation speed, and plasma storage condition are to be optimized for developing cancer-specific biomarkers useful for clinical purpose. Liquid biopsy-based origin of cell-free DNA has revolutionized the area of cancer research. Lack of preanalytical and analytical procedures may be considered for identification of novel biomarkers through next-generation sequencing of tumor-originated cell-free DNA in contradiction to tissue biopsy for cancer-specific biomarkers.",

        "Abstract": "DNA methylation plays a decisive role in the regulation and control of gene expression. DNA methylation is a covalent modification, in which a methyl group is attached to the 5th carbon of the cytosine ring of a CpG dinucleotide that is located upstream from the promoter region of a gene. Promoter hypermethylation (gain of DNA methylation) of the p16 gene may cause silencing of gene expression and plays an important role in cancer. Therefore, detection of the methylation status of p16 gene is an important tool in epigenetic studies of various human cancers. The methylation-specific PCR (MSP) is the most commonly used technique for studying DNA methylation. This technique is based on bisulfite modification of DNA, which converts unmethylated cytosine (C) into uracil (U) and leaving methylated cytosine (C",

        "Abstract": "Multiple genetic and environmental factors and their interaction are believed to contribute in the pathogenesis of Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC). We investigate the role of Metabolic Phase I (CYPs) and Phase II (GSTs) gene polymorphisms, gene-gene and gene-environmental interaction in modulating the susceptibility to NPC in Northeast India. To determine the association of metabolic gene polymorphisms and environmental habits, 123 cases and 189 controls blood/swab samples were used for PCR and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Analysis for GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphism was done by multiplex PCR. The T3801C in the 3'- flanking region of CYP1A1 gene was detected by PCR-RFLP method. The Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The GSTM1 null genotype alone (OR = 2.76) was significantly associated with NPC risk (P < 0.0001). The combinations of GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null genotypes also higher, 3.77 fold (P < 0.0001), risk of NPC, while GSTM1 null genotype along with CYP1A1 T3801C TC + CC genotype had 3.22 (P = 0.001) fold risk. The most remarkable risk was seen among individual carrying GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null genotypes and CYP1A1 T3801C TC + CC genotypes (OR = 5.71, P = 0.001). Further; analyses demonstrate an enhanced risk of NPC in smoked meat (OR = 5.56, P < 0.0001) and fermented fish consumers (OR = 5.73, P < 0.0001) carrying GSTM1 null genotype. An elevated risk of NPC was noted in smokers (OR = 12.67, P < 0.0001) and chewers (OR = 5.68, P < 0.0001) with GSTM1 null genotype. However, smokers had the highest risk of NPC among individuals carrying GSTT1 null genotype (OR = 4.46, P = 0.001) or CYP1A1 T3801C TC + CC genotype (OR = 7.13, P < 0.0001). The association of null genotypes and mutations of metabolic neutralizing genes along with the environmental habits (tobacco smokers and chewers, smoke meat, fermented fishes) can be used as a possible biomarker for early detection and preventive measure of NPC.",

        "Abstract": "Both conventional T (Tconv) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells are activated through ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex, leading to the induction of the transcription factor NF-κB. In Tconv cells, NF-κB regulates expression of genes essential for T cell activation, proliferation, and function. However the role of NF-κB in Treg function remains unclear. We conditionally deleted canonical NF-κB members p65 and c-Rel in developing and mature Treg cells and found they have unique but partially redundant roles. c-Rel was critical for thymic Treg development while p65 was essential for mature Treg identity and maintenance of immune tolerance. Transcriptome and NF-κB p65 binding analyses demonstrated a lineage specific, NF-κB-dependent transcriptional program, enabled by enhanced chromatin accessibility. These dual roles of canonical NF-κB in Tconv and Treg cells highlight the functional plasticity of the NF-κB signaling pathway and underscores the need for more selective strategies to therapeutically target NF-κB.",

        "Abstract": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in the inhibition of anti-tumor immune responses. Understanding the mechanisms governing Treg homeostasis may therefore be important for development of effective tumor immunotherapy. We have recently demonstrated a key role for the canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) subunits, p65 and c-Rel, in Treg identity and function. In this report, we show that NF-κB c-Rel ablation specifically impairs the generation and maintenance of the activated Treg (aTreg) subset, which is known to be enriched at sites of tumors. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that melanoma growth is drastically reduced in mice lacking c-Rel, but not p65, in Tregs. Moreover, chemical inhibition of c-Rel function delayed melanoma growth by impairing aTreg-mediated immunosuppression and potentiated the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Our studies therefore establish inhibition of NF-κB c-Rel as a viable therapeutic approach for enhancing checkpoint-targeting immunotherapy protocols.",

Here, we describe a meta-analysis of two independent RNA-seq studies to identify lncRNAs that are differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection. Only three lncRNA genes exhibited altered expression of ≥ 2-fold in HIV-1-infected cells. Of these, the uncharacterized lncRNA LINC00173 was chosen for further study. Both transcript variants of LINC00173 (lnc173 TSV1 and 2) could be detected by qPCR, localized predominantly to the nucleus and were reproducibly up-regulated during infection. Knock-out of the LINC00173 locus did not have detectable effects on HIV-1 replication. Interestingly, however, stimulation of Jurkat T cells with PMA/ionomycin resulted in a decrease of lnc173 expression, and Jurkat cells deficient for lnc173 on average expressed higher levels of specific cytokines than control cells. These data suggest that lnc173 may have a role in the regulation of cytokines in T cells.",

        "Abstract": "The ornamental fishes were exported under the trade names or generic names, thus creating problems in species identification. In this regard, DNA barcoding could effectively elucidate the actual species status. However, the problem arises if the specimen is having taxonomic disputes, falsified by trade/generic names, etc., On the other hand, barcoding the archival museum specimens would be of greater benefit to address such issues as it would create firm, error-free reference database for rapid identification of any species. This can be achieved only by generating short sequences as DNA from chemically preserved are mostly degraded. Here we aimed to identify a short stretch of informative sites within the full-length barcode segment, capable of delineating diverse group of ornamental fish species, commonly traded from NE India. We analyzed 287 full-length barcode sequences from the major fish orders and compared the interspecific K2P distance with nucleotide substitutions patterns and found a strong correlation of interspecies distance with transversions (0.95, p<0.001). We, therefore, proposed a short stretch of 171bp (transversion rich) segment as mini-barcode. The proposed segment was compared with the full-length barcodes and found to delineate the species effectively. Successful PCR amplification and sequencing of the 171bp segment using designed primers for different orders validated it as mini-barcodes for ornamental fishes. Thus, our findings would be helpful in strengthening the global database with the sequence of archived fish species as well as an effective identification tool of the traded ornamental fish species, as a less time consuming, cost effective field-based application.",

        "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of inflammation. To further understand the interaction between inflammatory signaling pathways and lncRNAs, we characterized the function of cardiac and apoptosis-related lncRNA (Carlr), an lncRNA expressed in both mouse and human cells of diverse tissues. Carlr expression is increased following NF-κB signaling in macrophages, with concomitant translocation to, and enrichment of, the transcript in the cytoplasm. Knockdown of Carlr results in impaired expression of NF-κB pathway genes and influences the interaction between macrophages and intestinal cells in an inflammatory environment. In human celiac disease patient samples, increased levels of the Carlr transcript were detected in the cytoplasm, alongside elevated expression of NF-κB pathway genes. These findings suggest that increased Carlr expression and/or cytoplasmic localization is required for efficient NF-κB signaling and is associated with the inflamed tissue state observed in human celiac disease.",

Disruptions to the microbiome have been shown to be associated with severe pathologies of the host, including metabolic disease, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Mood and behavior are also susceptible to alterations in the gut microbiota. A particularly striking example of the symbiotic effects of the microbiome is the immune system, whose cells depend critically on a diverse array of microbial metabolites for normal development and behavior. This includes metabolites that are produced by bacteria from dietary components, metabolites that are produced by the host and biochemically modified by gut bacteria, and metabolites that are synthesized de novo by gut microbes. In this review, we highlight the role of the intestinal microbiome in human metabolic and inflammatory diseases and focus in particular on the molecular mechanisms that govern the gut-immune axis.",

        "Title": "Design of character-based DNA barcode motif for species identification: A computational approach and its validation in fishes.",
        "Abstract": "The DNA barcodes are generally interpreted using distance-based and character-based methods. The former uses clustering of comparable groups, based on the relative genetic distance, while the latter is based on the presence or absence of discrete nucleotide substitutions. The distance-based approach has a limitation in defining a universal species boundary across the taxa as the rate of mtDNA evolution is not constant throughout the taxa. However, character-based approach more accurately defines this using a unique set of nucleotide characters. The character-based analysis of full-length barcode has some inherent limitations, like sequencing of the full-length barcode, use of a sparse-data matrix and lack of a uniform diagnostic position for each group. A short continuous stretch of a fragment can be used to resolve the limitations. Here, we observe that a 154-bp fragment, from the transversion-rich domain of 1367 COI barcode sequences can successfully delimit species in the three most diverse orders of freshwater fishes. This fragment is used to design species-specific barcode motifs for 109 species by the character-based method, which successfully identifies the correct species using a pattern-matching program. The motifs also correctly identify geographically isolated population of the Cypriniformes species. Further, this region is validated as a species-specific mini-barcode for freshwater fishes by successful PCR amplification and sequencing of the motif (154 bp) using the designed primers. We anticipate that use of such motifs will enhance the diagnostic power of DNA barcode, and the mini-barcode approach will greatly benefit the field-based system of rapid species identification.",

        "Title": "Genetic assessment of leech species from yak (Bos grunniens) in the tract of Northeast India.",
        "Abstract": "Yak is an iconic symbol of Tibet and high altitudes of Northeast India. It is highly cherished for milk, meat, and skin. However, yaks suffer drastic change in milk production, weight loss, etc, when infested by parasites. Among them, infestation by leeches is a serious problem in the Himalayan belt of Northeast India. The parasite feeds on blood externally or from body orifices, like nasopharynx, oral, rectum, etc. But there has been limited data about the leech species infesting the yak in that region because of the difficulties in morphological identification due to plasticity of the body, changes in shape, and surface structure and thus, warrants for the molecular characterization of leech. In anticipation, this study would be influential in proper identification of leech species infesting yak track and also helpful in inventorying of leech species in Northeast India. Here, we investigated, through combined approach of molecular markers and morphological parameters for the identification of leech species infesting yak. The DNA sequences of COI barcode fragment, 18S and 28S rDNA, were analyzed for species identification. The generated sequences were subjected to similarity match in global database and analyzed further through Neighbour-Joining, K2P distance based as well as ML approach. Among the three markers, only COI was successful in delineating species whereas the 18S and 28S failed to delineate the species. Our study confirmed the presence of the species from genus Hirudinaria, Haemadipsa, Whitmania, and one species Myxobdella annandalae, which has not been previously reported from this region.",

        "Abstract": "DNA repair pathway is a primary defense system that eliminates wide varieties of DNA damage. Any deficiencies in them are likely to cause the chromosomal instability that leads to cell malfunctioning and tumorigenesis. Genetic polymorphisms in DNA repair genes have demonstrated a significant association with cancer risk. Our study attempts to give a glimpse of the overall scenario of the germline polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes by taking into account of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database as well as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) for evaluating the disease link, particularly in cancer. It has been found that ExAC DNA repair dataset (which consists of 228 DNA repair genes) comprises 30.4% missense, 12.5% dbSNP reported and 3.2% ClinVar significant variants. 27% of all the missense variants has the deleterious SIFT score of 0.00 and 6% variants carrying the most damaging Polyphen-2 score of 1.00, thus affecting the protein structure and function. However, as per HGMD, only a fraction (1.2%) of ExAC DNA repair variants was found to be cancer-related, indicating remaining variants reported in both the databases to be further analyzed. This, in turn, may provide an increased spectrum of the reported cancer linked variants in the DNA repair genes present in ExAC database. Moreover, further in silico functional assay of the identified vital cancer-associated variants, which is essential to get their actual biological significance, may shed some lights in the field of targeted drug development in near future.",

        "Abstract": "LPS is a potent trigger of macrophage-mediated inflammation. However, prolonged exposure to LPS induces a state of tolerance that reprograms the inflammatory response, resulting in reduced inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. Recent evidence suggests that LPS tolerance also increases the expression of a subset of genes that may protect animals from systemic infection while they are in the tolerized state. However, a molecular basis for these selective changes in inflammatory gene expression during LPS tolerance has remained elusive. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that may account for these effects, focusing on changes in LPS signaling, epigenetic markers, and chromatin remodeling that may be responsible for cellular memory and physiologic changes that comprise the LPS tolerance phenomenon.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple genetic and environmental factors have been reported to play key role in the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we investigated interactions of XRCC1 Arg399Gln and XRCC2 Arg188His polymorphisms and environmental factors in modulating susceptibility to NPC in Northeast India. One-hundred NPC patients, 90 first-degree relatives of patients and 120 controls were enrolled in the study. XRCC1 Arg399Gln and XRCC2 Arg188His polymorphisms were determined using PCR-RFLP, and the results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Logistic regression (LR) and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) approaches were applied for statistical analysis. The XRCC1 Gln/Gln genotype showed increased risk (OR=2.76; <0.024) of NPC. However, individuals with both XRCC1 and XRCC2 polymorphic variants had 3.2 fold elevated risk (<0.041). An enhanced risk of NPC was also observed in smoked meat (OR=4.07; P=0.004) and fermented fish consumers (OR=4.34, P=0.001), and tobacco-betel quid chewers (OR=7.00; P=0.0001) carrying XRCC1 polymorphic variants. However, smokers carrying defective XRCC1 gene showed the highest risk (OR = 7.47; <0.0001). On MDR analysis, the best model for NPC risk was the five-factor model combination of XRCC1 variant genotype, fermented fish, smoked meat, smoking and chewing (CVC=10/10; TBA=0.636; <0.0001); whereas in interaction entropy graphs, smoked meat and tobacco chewing showed synergistic interactions with XRCC1. These findings suggest that interaction of genetic and environmental factors might increase susceptibility to NPC in Northeast Indian populations.",

        "Abstract": "Asymmetric cell division (ACD) in a perpendicular orientation promotes cell differentiation and organizes the stratified epithelium. However, the upstream cues regulating ACD have not been identified. Here, we report that phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) plays a critical role in establishing ACD in the epithelium. Production of phosphatidyl inositol triphosphate (PIP3) is localized to the apical side of basal cells. Asymmetric recruitment of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and partitioning defective (PAR) 3 is impaired in PDK1 conditional knockout (CKO) epidermis. PDK1(CKO) keratinocytes do not undergo calcium-induced activation of aPKC or IGF1-induced activation of AKT and fail to differentiate. PDK1(CKO) epidermis shows decreased expression of Notch, a downstream effector of ACD, and restoration of Notch rescues defective expression of differentiation-induced Notch targets in vitro. We therefore propose that PDK1 signaling regulates the basal-to-suprabasal switch in developing epidermis by acting as both an activator and organizer of ACD and the Notch-dependent differentiation program.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have implicated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as regulators of many important biological processes. Here we report on the identification and characterization of a lncRNA, lnc13, that harbors a celiac disease-associated haplotype block and represses expression of certain inflammatory genes under homeostatic conditions. Lnc13 regulates gene expression by binding to hnRNPD, a member of a family of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Upon stimulation, lnc13 levels are reduced, thereby allowing increased expression of the repressed genes. Lnc13 levels are significantly decreased in small intestinal biopsy samples from patients with celiac disease, which suggests that down-regulation of lnc13 may contribute to the inflammation seen in this disease. Furthermore, the lnc13 disease-associated variant binds hnRNPD less efficiently than its wild-type counterpart, thus helping to explain how these single-nucleotide polymorphisms contribute to celiac disease.",

        "Abstract": "More than two third area of our planet is covered by oceans and assessment of marine biodiversity is a challenging task. With the increasing global population, there is a tendency to exploit marine resources for food, energy and other requirements. This puts pressure on the fragile marine environment and necessitates sustainable conservation efforts. Marine species identification using traditional taxonomical methods is often burdened with taxonomic controversies. Here we discuss the comparatively new concept of DNA barcoding and its significance in marine perspective. This molecular technique can be useful in the assessment of cryptic species which is widespread in marine environment and linking the different life cycle stages to the adult which is difficult to accomplish in the marine ecosystem. Other advantages of DNA barcoding include authentication and safety assessment of seafood, wildlife forensics, conservation genetics and detection of invasive alien species (IAS). Global DNA barcoding efforts in the marine habitat include MarBOL, CeDAMar, CMarZ, SHARK-BOL, etc. An overview on DNA barcoding of different marine groups ranging from the microbes to mammals is revealed. In conjugation with newer and faster techniques like high-throughput sequencing, DNA barcoding can serve as an effective modern tool in marine biodiversity assessment and conservation.",

TLR11 has been shown to interact with two known protein PAMPs: Salmonella and E. coli flagellin FliC and Toxoplasma gondii profilin-like protein. Given the highly divergent biology of these pathogens recognized by TLR11, it is unclear whether common mechanisms are used to recognize these distinct protein PAMPs. Here we show that TLR11 interacts with these two PAMPs using different receptor domains. Furthermore, TLR11 binding to flagellin and profilin exhibits differential dependency on pH and receptor ectodomain cleavage.",

        "Abstract": "Methanogens, a key contributor in global carbon cycling, methane emission, and alternative energy production, generate methane gas via anaerobic digestion of organic matter. The methane emission potential depends upon methanogenic diversity and activity. Since they are anaerobes and difficult to isolate and culture, their diversity present in the landfill sites of Delhi and marshlands of Southern Assam, India, was analyzed using molecular techniques like 16S rDNA sequencing, DGGE, and qPCR. The sequencing results indicated the presence of methanogens belonging to the seventh order and also the order Methanomicrobiales in the Ghazipur and Bhalsawa landfill sites of Delhi. Sequences, related to the phyla Crenarchaeota (thermophilic) and Thaumarchaeota (mesophilic), were detected from marshland sites of Southern Assam, India. Jaccard analysis of DGGE gel using Gel2K showed three main clusters depending on the number and similarity of band patterns. The copy number analysis of hydrogenotrophic methanogens using qPCR indicates higher abundance in landfill sites of Delhi as compared to the marshlands of Southern Assam. The knowledge about \"methanogenic archaea composition\" and \"abundance\" in the contrasting ecosystems like \"landfill\" and \"marshland\" may reorient our understanding of the Archaea inhabitants. This study could shed light on the relationship between methane-dynamics and the global warming process.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal diarrheagenic polyparasitic infections are among the major public health concerns in developing countries. Here we examined stool specimens by microscopy, DNA dot blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to evaluate the co-infection of four principal protozoans among amoebic dysentery cases from Northeast Indian population. The multiplex PCR confirmed Entamoeba histolytica (8.1%), Entamoeba dispar (4.8%) and mixed infection of both the parasites (3.4%) in 68 of 356 stool specimens that were positive in microscopy and/or HMe probe based DNA dot blot screening. The prevailing parasite that co-exists with E. histolytica was Giardia duodenalis (34.1%), followed by Enterocytozoon bieneusi (22.0%), Cryptosporidium parvum (14.6%) and Cyclospora cayetanensis (7.3%, P = 0.017). Symptomatic participants (odds ratio (OR) = 4.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06, 15.68; P = 0.041), monsoon season (OR = 7.47; 95% CI = 1.40, 39.84; P = 0.046) and participants with family history of parasitic infection (OR = 4.50; 95% CI = 1.16, 17.51; P = 0.030) have significant association with overall co-infection rate. According to molecular consensus, comprehensive microscopy yielded 3.4% (12/356) false-negative and 7.6% (27/356) false-positive outcome, suggesting an improved broad-spectrum PCR-based diagnostic is required to scale down the poor sensitivity and specificity as well as implementation of integrated control strategy.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is a key signaling molecule downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and is a master regulator of multiple kinases in cells of epithelial and hematopoietic lineages. The physiological role of PDK1 in regulating skin and immune homeostasis is not known. Here we developed a mouse model in which PDK1 is conditionally ablated in activated CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells, and mature keratinocytes through OX40-Cre recombinase expression. The resultant mice (PDK1-CKO) spontaneously developed severe dermatitis, skin fibrosis, and systemic T helper type 2 immunity, succumbing by 11 weeks of age. Through a series of T-cell transfers, bone marrow reconstitutions, and crossing to lymphocyte-deficient backgrounds, we demonstrate that ablation of PDK1 in keratinocytes is the major driver of disease pathogenesis. PDK1-deficient keratinocytes exhibit intrinsic defects in the expression of key structural proteins including cytokeratin-10 and loricrin, resulting in increased keratinocyte turnover, which in turn triggers inflammation, T-cell recruitment, and immune-mediated destruction. Our results reveal PDK1 as a central regulator of keratinocyte homeostasis that prevents skin immune infiltration and inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms in tobacco-metabolizing genes may modulate the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC). In Northeast India, head and neck cancers and tobacco consumption remains most prevalent. The aim of the study was to investigate the combined effect of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) T3801C, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genes polymorphisms and smoking and tobacco-betel quid chewing in the risk of HNC. The study included 420 subjects (180 cases and 240 controls) from Northeast Indian population. Polymorphisms of CYP1A1 T3801C and GST (M1 & T1) were studied by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and multiplex PCR, respectively. Logistic regression (LR) and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) approach were applied for statistical analysis. LR analysis revealed that subjects carrying CYP1A1 TC/CC + GSTM1 null genotypes had 3.52-fold (P < 0.001) increase the risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Smokers carrying CYP1A1 TC/CC + GSTM1 null and CYP1A1 TC/CC + GSTT1 null genotypes showed significant association with HNC risk (odds ratio [OR] = 6.42; P < 0.001 and 3.86; P = 0.005, respectively). Similarly, tobacco-betel quid chewers carrying CYP1A1 TC/CC + GSTM1 null genotypes also had several fold increased risk of HNC (P < 0.001). In MDR analysis, the best model for HNSCC risk was the four-factor model of tobacco-betel quid chewing, smoking, CYP1A1 TC/CC, and GSTM1 null genotypes (testing balance accuracy [TBA] = 0.6292; cross-validation consistency [CVC] = 9/10 and P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that interaction of combined genotypes of carcinogen-metabolizing genes with environmental factors might modulate susceptibility of HNC in Northeast Indian population.",

        "Abstract": "Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease in which activated immune cells and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF are well-known mediators of pathogenesis. The transcription factor NF-κB is a key regulator of TNF production and TNF-induced proinflammatory gene expression, and both the psoriatic transcriptome and genetic susceptibility further implicate NF-κB in psoriasis etiopathology. However, the role of NF-κB in psoriasis remains controversial. We analyzed the function of canonical NF-κB in the epidermis using CRE-mediated deletion of p65 and c-Rel in keratinocytes. In contrast to animals lacking p65 or c-Rel alone, mice lacking both subunits developed severe dermatitis after birth. Consistent with its partial histological similarity to human psoriasis, this condition could be prevented by anti-TNF treatment. Moreover, regulatory T cells in lesional skin played an important role in disease remission. Our results demonstrate that canonical NF-κB in keratinocytes is essential for the maintenance of skin immune homeostasis and is protective against spontaneous dermatitis.",

        "Abstract": "Several studies from developing countries have shown human papillomavirus to be associated with colorectal cancers, but the molecular characteristics of such cancers are poorly known. We studied the various genetic variations like microsatellite instability (MSI), oncogenic mutations and epigenetic deregulations like CpG island methylation in HPV associated and nonassociated colorectal cancer patients from Indian population. HPV DNA was detected by PCR using My09/My11 and Gp5+/Gp6+ consensus primers and typed using HPV16 and HPV18 specific primers. MSI was detected using BAT 25 and BAT 26 markers, and mutation of KRAS, TP53 and BRAF V600E were detected by direct sequencing. Methyl specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to determine promoter methylation of the classical CIMP panel markers (P16, hMLH1, MINT1, MINT2 and MINT31) and other tumour-related genes (DAPK, RASSF1, BRCA1 and GSTP1). HPV DNA was detected in 34/93 (36.5 %) colorectal tumour tissues, HPV 18 being the predominant high-risk type. MSI was detected in 7.5 % cases; KRAS codon 12, 13, BRAF V600E and TP53 mutations were detected in 36.5, 3.2 and 37.6 % of the cases, respectively. CIMP-high was observed in 44.08 % cases. HPV presence was not associated with age, stage or grade of tumours, MSI or mutations in KRAS, TP53 or BRAF genes. Higher methylation frequencies of all genes/loci under study except RASSF1, as well as significantly higher CIMP-high characteristics were observed in HPV positive tumours as compared to negative cases. HPV in association with genetic and epigenetic features might be a potent risk factor for colorectal cancer in Indian population.",

        "Title": "Trend of different molecular markers in the last decades for studying human migrations.",
        "Abstract": "Anatomically modern humans are known to have widely migrated throughout history. Different scientific evidences suggest that the entire human population descended from just several thousand African migrants. About 85,000 years ago, the first wave of human migration was out of Africa, that followed the coasts through the Middle East, into Southern Asia via Sri Lanka, and in due course around Indonesia and into Australia. Another wave of migration between 40,000 and 12,000 years ago brought humans northward into Europe. However, the frozen north limited human expansion in Europe, and created a land bridge, \"Bering land bridge\", connecting Asia with North America about 25,000 years ago. Although fossil data give the most direct information about our past, it has certain anomalies. So, molecular archeologists are now using different molecular markers to trace the \"most recent common ancestor\" and also the migration pattern of modern humans. In this study, we have studied the trend of molecular markers and also the methodologies implemented in the last decades (2003-2014). From our observation, we can say that D-loop region of mtDNA and Y chromosome based markers are predominant. Nevertheless, mtDNA, especially the D-loop region, has some unique features, which makes it a more effective marker for tracing prehistoric footprints of modern human populations. Although, natural selection should also be taken into account in studying mtDNA based human migration. As per technology is concerned, Sanger sequencing is the major technique that is being used in almost all studies. But, the emergence of different cost-effective-and-easy-to-handle NGS platforms has increased its popularity over Sanger sequencing in studying human migration.",

        "Title": "Genetic assessment of ornamental fish species from North East India.",
        "Abstract": "Ornamental fishes are traded with multiple names from various parts around the world, including North East India. Most are collected from the wild, due to lack of species-specific culture or breeding, and therefore, such unmanaged collection of the wild and endemic species could lead to severe threats to biodiversity. Despite many regulatory policies, trade of threatened species, including the IUCN listed species have been largely uncontrolled, due to species identification problems arising from the utilization of multiple trade names. So, the development of species-specific DNA marker is indispensable where DNA Barcoding is proved to be helpful in species identification. Here, we investigated, through DNA Barcoding and morphological assessment, the identification of 128 ornamental fish specimens exported from NE India from different exporters. The generated sequences were subjected to similarity match in BOLD-IDS as well as BLASTN, and analysed using MEGA5.2 for species identification through Neighbour-Joining (NJ) clustering, and K2P distance based approach. The analysis revealed straightforward identification of 84 specimens into 35 species, while 44 specimens were difficult to distinguish based on CO1 barcode alone. However, these cases were resolved through morphology, NJ and distanced based method and found to be belonging to 16 species. Among the 51 identified species, 14 species represented multiple trade names; 17 species belonged to threatened category. Species-level identification through DNA Barcoding along with traditional morphotaxonomy reflects its efficacy in regulating ornamental fish trade and therefore, appeals for their conservation in nature. The use of trade names rather than the zoological name created the passage for trafficking of the threatened species and demands immediate attention for sustaining wildlife conservation.",

        "Abstract": "Rectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease that develops through multiple pathways characterized by genetic and epigenetic alterations. India has a comparatively higher proportion of rectal cancers and early-onset cases. We analyzed genetic (KRAS, TP53 and BRAF mutations, and MSI), epigenetic alterations (CpG island methylation detection of 10 tumor-related genes/loci), the associated clinicopathological features and survival trend in 80 primary rectal cancer patients from India. MSI was detected using BAT 25 and BAT 26 mononucleotide markers and mutation of KRAS, TP53, and BRAF V600E was detected by direct sequencing. Methyl specific polymerase chain reaction was used to determine promoter methylation status of the classic CIMP panel markers (P16, hMLH1, MINT1, MINT2, and MINT31) as well as other tumor specific genes (DAPK, RASSF1, BRCA1, and GSTP1). MSI and BRAF mutations were uncommon but high frequencies of overall KRAS mutations (67.5%); low KRAS codon 12 and a novel KRAS G15S mutation with concomitant RASSF1 methylation in early onset cases were remarkable. Hierarchical clustering as well as principal component analysis identified three distinct subgroups of patients having discrete age at onset, clinicopathological, molecular and survival characteristics: (i) a KRAS associated CIMP-high subgroup; (ii) a significantly younger MSS, CIMP low, TP53 mutant group having differential KRAS mutation patterns, and (iii) a CIMP-negative, TP53 mutated group. The early onset subgroup exhibited the most unfavorable disease characteristics with advanced stage, poorly differentiated tumors and had the poorest survival compared to the other subgroups. Genetic and epigenetic profiling of rectal cancer patients identified distinct subtypes in Indian population.",

        "Abstract": "The transformation of cells generally involves multiple genetic lesions that undermine control of both cell death and proliferation. We now report that κB-Ras proteins act as regulators of NF-κB and Ral pathways, which control inflammation/cell death and proliferation, respectively. Cells lacking κB-Ras therefore not only show increased NF-κB activity, which results in increased expression of inflammatory mediators, but also exhibit elevated Ral activity, which leads to enhanced anchorage-independent proliferation (AIP). κB-Ras deficiency consequently leads to significantly increased tumor growth that can be dampened by inhibiting either Ral or NF-κB pathways, revealing the unique tumor-suppressive potential of κB-Ras proteins. Remarkably, numerous human tumors show reduced levels of κB-Ras, and increasing the level of κB-Ras in these tumor cells impairs their ability to undergo AIP, thereby implicating κB-Ras proteins in human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been recently associated with squamous cell carcinoma of upper aerodigestive tract (SCC of UADT), but its possible role in promoting aberrant methylation in these tumors has largely remained unexplored. Herein, we investigated the association of HPV with aberrant methylation in tumor-related genes/loci consisting of the classical CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) panel markers (p16, MLH1, MINT1, MINT2, and MINT31) and other frequently methylated cancer-related genes (DAPK1, GSTP1, BRCA1, ECAD, and RASSF1) and survival of UDAT cancers. The study includes 219 SCC of UADT patients from different hospitals of Northeast India. Detection of HPV and aberrant promoter methylation was performed by PCR and Methylation Specific PCR respectively. Association study was conducted by Logistic regression analysis and overall survival analysis was done by Kaplan-Meier plot. HPV was detected in 37% of cases, with HPV-18 as the major high-risk sub-type. Although HPV presence did not seem to affect survival in overall UADT cancers, but was associated with a favourable prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Hierarchical clustering revealed three distinct clusters with different methylation profile and HPV presence. Among these, the CIMP-high subgroup exhibited the highest HPV positive cases (66%). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed a strong synergistic association of HPV and tobacco towards modulating promoter hypermethylation in UADT cancer (OR = 27.50 [95% CI = 11.51-88.03] for CIMP-high vs. CIMP-low). The present study proposes a potential role of HPV in impelling aberrant methylation in specific tumor related loci, which might contribute in the initiation and progression of SCC of UADT.",

        "Title": "Utility of indels for species-level identification of a biologically complex plant group: a study with intergenic spacer in Citrus.",
        "Abstract": "The Consortium of Barcode of Life plant working group proposed to use the defined portion of plastid genes rbcL and matK either singly or in combination as the standard DNA barcode for plants. But DNA barcode based identification of biologically complex plant groups are always a challenging task due to the occurrence of natural hybridization. Here, we examined the use of indels polymorphism in trnH-psbA and trnL-trnF sequences for rapid species identification of citrus. DNA from young leaves of selected citrus species were isolated and matK gene (~800 bp) and trnH-psbA spacer (~450 bp) of Chloroplast DNA was amplified for species level identification. The sequences within the group taxa of Citrus were aligned using the ClustalX program. With few obvious misalignments were corrected manually using the similarity criterion. We identified a 54 bp inverted repeat or palindrome sequence (27-80 regions) and 6 multi residues indel coding regions. Large inverted repeats in cpDNA provided authentication at the higher taxonomic levels. These diagnostics indel marker from trnH-psbA were successful in identifying different species (5 out of 7) within the studied Citrus except Citrus limon and Citrus medica. These two closely related species are distinguished through the 6 bp deletion in trnL-trnF. This study demonstrated that the indel polymorphism based approach easily characterizes the Citrus species and the same may be applied in other complex groups. Likewise other indels occurring intergenic spacer of chloroplast regions may be tested for rapid identification of other secondary citrus species.",

        "Title": "Regulation of NF-κB by TNF family cytokines.",
        "Abstract": "The NF-κB family of inducible transcription factors is activated in response to a variety of stimuli. Amongst the best-characterized inducers of NF-κB are members of the TNF family of cytokines. Research on NF-κB and TNF have been tightly intertwined for more than 25 years. Perhaps the most compelling examples of the interconnectedness of NF-κB and the TNF have come from analysis of knock-out mice that are unable to activate NF-κB. Such mice die embryonically, however, deletion of TNF or TNFR1 can rescue the lethality thereby illustrating the important role of NF-κB as the key regulator of transcriptional responses to TNF. The physiological connections between NF-κB and TNF cytokines are numerous and best explored in articles focusing on a single TNF family member. Instead, in this review, we explore general mechanisms of TNF cytokine signaling, with a focus on the upstream signaling events leading to activation of the so-called canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways by TNFR1 and CD40, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Tobacco consumption in various forms is one of the major risk factor for the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Polymorphisms in XRCC1 and XRCC2 genes may alter an individual's susceptibility to tobacco-related cancers. Here, we have investigated the interaction of XRCC1 (Arg399Gln) and XRCC2 (Arg188His) polymorphism and tobacco exposure in the progression of HNSCC in northeast Indian population. The population-based case-control study includes 110 HNSCC patients and 140 controls. The polymorphisms of XRCC1 and XRCC2 were studied by means of PCR-RFLP, and the results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Smokers and tobacco-betel quid chewers were significantly higher in cases (P = 0.045 and 0.033). The variant homozygote AA genotype of XRCC1 Arg399Gln and heterozygote GA genotype of XRCC2 Arg188His has an increased risk toward HNSCC (OR 2.43; P = 0.031 and OR 3.29; P < 0.01, respectively). The interaction between tobacco-betel quid chewing and variant genotypes of XRCC1 and XRCC2 resulted in several fold increase the risk of HNSCC, when compared to non-chewers. Heavy smokers carrying XRCC1 AA and XRCC2 GA genotypes had a significantly higher risk of HNSCC compared to never smokers (P = 0.017 and 0.003, respectively). Upon gene-gene interaction analysis, individuals carrying both XRCC1 GA (Arg/Gln) and XRCC2 GA (Arg/His) genotypes had the highest risk of HNSCC (P = 0.001).Our finding suggests that interaction of tobacco and polymorphisms of XRCC1 and XRCC2 increases the risk of HNSCC. Furthermore, cross talk between these two DNA repair genes might modulate susceptibility toward HNSCC.",

        "Abstract": "A20 has been suggested to limit NF-κB activation by removing regulatory ubiquitin chains from ubiquitinated substrates. A20 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that removes K63-linked ubiquitin chains from adaptor proteins, such as RIP1, and then conjugates them to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains to trigger proteasomal degradation. To determine the role of the deubiquitinase function of A20 in downregulating NF-κB signaling, we have generated a knock-in mouse that lacks the deubiquitinase function of A20 (A20-OTU mice). These mice are normal and have no signs of inflammation, have normal proportions of B, T, dendritic, and myeloid cells, respond normally to LPS and TNF, and undergo normal NF-κB activation. Our results thus indicate that the deubiquitinase activity of A20 is dispensable for normal NF-κB signaling.",

Widely accepted biochemical panels for HNSCC detection is not available yet. We tried to find out the effectiveness of the serum-based biochemical markers for their prognostic significance in HNSCC. We collected fresh blood samples of 80 HNSCC patients and 100 healthy subjects. Samples were analyzed for absolute levels of arginase (ARG), ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), catalase (CAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), amylase (AMY) activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Receiver-operator characteristic curves and Fagan's nomograms were generated. Out of six parameters studied, four (OAT, CAT, LDH, and AMY) did not show biologically significant differences to be used as biomarkers. Significant elevation in serum ARG and CRP levels were observed in HNSCC. The individual estimation of ARG and CRP showed lower specificity, but their combination improved the specificity level to 95%. Our results suggest that serum ARG and CRP together can efficiently diagnose HNSCC.",

        "Abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare cancer worldwide, but in India, NPC is uncommon in its subcontinent except in the north-eastern part of the country. NPC is thought to be caused by the combined effects of environmental carcinogens, genetic susceptibility and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This is the first study that aimed to examine the selected risk factors, mostly dietary, viral environmental, metabolic gene polymorphisms, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number variation and their risk, in subjects who are highly prone to NPC in the ethnic groups of Northeast India, which has included cases, first-degree relatives and controls. The cases and controls were selected from three ethnic groups (Manipuri, Naga and Mizo) of Northeast India with high prevalence of NPC. This case-control family study includes 64 NPC patients, 88 first-degree relatives and 100 controls having no history of cancer. PCR-based detection was done for EBV-latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) gene and glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1)-glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1) polymorphism. A comparative ΔCt method was used for the determination of mtDNA content. An increased risk of 2.00-6.06-folds to NPC was observed with those who intake smoked meat and fish, salted fish and fermented fish; betel nut chewers; tobacco smokers; alcohol drinkers; and those who have kitchen inside the living room, glutathione S-transferase null genotype and EBV infection. The risk of NPC increased in cases with decreased mtDNA copy number (P trend = 0.007). A significant difference between GST null genotypes and EBV infection with mtDNA content was found in the cases (P < 0.0001). The understandings of environment-genetic risk factors and their role in the etiology of NPC are helpful as preventive measures and screening.",

        "Abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) is a highly inducible cytokine receptor that engages multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Fn14 expression is regulated by several cytokines and growth factors, and Fn14 is transiently up-regulated after injury. In contrast, in states of chronic inflammatory disease and in some solid tumors, Fn14 is persistently up-regulated. However, the post-translational regulation of Fn14 expression has not been directly investigated. Thus, we examined Fn14 proteostasis in the presence and absence of the Fn14 ligand TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK). Similar to other TNF receptor superfamily members, we found that TWEAK induces Fn14 internalization and degradation. Surprisingly, we also observed rapid, TWEAK-independent, constitutive Fn14 internalization and turnover. Fn14 levels are maintained in cell culture by ongoing synthesis and trafficking of the receptor, leading to subsequent down-regulation by lysosomal degradation. Unexpectedly, the extracellular domain of Fn14 is necessary and sufficient for constitutive turnover. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which constitutive down-regulation of Fn14 facilitates dynamic regulation of Fn14 protein levels and prevents spontaneous or inappropriate receptor signaling.",

        "Abstract": "The NF-κB family of transcription factors plays a central role in the inducible expression of inflammatory genes during the immune response, and the proper regulation of these genes is a critical factor in the maintenance of immune homeostasis. The chromatin environment at stimulus-responsive NF-κB sites is a major determinant in transcription factor binding, and dynamic alteration of the chromatin state to facilitate transcription factor binding is a key regulatory mechanism. NF-κB is in turn able to influence the chromatin state through a variety of mechanisms, including the recruitment of chromatin modifying co-activator complexes such as p300, the competitive eviction of negative chromatin modifications, and the recruitment of components of the general transcriptional machinery. Frequently, the selective interaction with these co-activators is dependent on specific post-translational modification of NF-κB subunits. Finally, the mechanisms of inducible NF-κB activity in different immune cell types seem to be largely conserved. The diversity of cell-specific NF-κB-mediated transcriptional programs is established at the chromatin level during cell differentiation by lineage-defining transcription factors. These factors generate and maintain a cell-specific chromatin landscape that is accessible to NF-κB, thus restricting the inducible transcriptional response to a cell-appropriate output.",

        "Abstract": "Efficacy of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) DNA barcode in higher taxon assignment is still under debate in spite of several attempts, using the conventional DNA barcoding methods, to assign higher taxa. Here we try to understand whether nucleotide and amino acid sequence in COI gene carry sufficient information to assign species to their higher taxonomic rank, using 160 species of Indian freshwater fishes. Our results reveal that with increase in the taxonomic rank, sequence conservation decreases for both nucleotides and amino acids. Order level exhibits lowest conservation with 50% of the nucleotides and amino acids being conserved. Among the variable sites, 30-50% were found to carry high information content within an order, while it was 70-80% within a family and 80-99% within a genus. High information content shows sites with almost conserved sequence but varying at one or two locations, which can be due to variations at species or population level. Thus, the potential of COI gene in higher taxon assignment is revealed with validation of ample inherent signals latent in the gene.",

        "Abstract": "Freshwater fishes in India are poorly known and plagued by many unresolved cryptic species complexes that masks some latent and endemic species. Limitations in traditional taxonomy have resulted in this crypticism. Hence, molecular approaches like DNA barcoding, are needed to diagnose these latent species. We have analyzed 1383 barcode sequences of 175 Indian freshwater fish species available in the databases, of which 172 sequences of 70 species were generated. The congeneric and conspecific genetic divergences were calculated using Kimura's 2 parameter distance model followed by the construction of a Neighbor Joining tree using the MEGA 5.1. DNA barcoding principle at its first hand approach, led to the straightforward identification of 82% of the studied species with 2.9% (S.E=0.2) divergence between the nearest congeners. However, after validating some cases of synonymy and mislabeled sequences, 5% more species were found to be valid. Sequences submitted to the database under different names were found to represent single species. On the other hand, some sequences of the species like Barilius barna, Barilius bendelisis and Labeo bata were submitted to the database under a single name but were found to represent either some unexplored species or latent species. Overall, 87% of the available Indian freshwater fish barcodes were diagnosed as true species in parity with the existing checklist and can act as reference barcode for the particular taxa. For the remaining 13% (21 species) the correct species name was difficult to assign as they depicted some erroneous identification and cryptic species complex. Thus, these barcodes will need further assay and inclusion of barcodes of more specimens from same and sister species.",

        "Abstract": "Recovery of DNA barcode sequences is often challenging from the archived specimens. However, short fragments of DNA may be recovered, which would significantly improve many unresolved taxonomic conflicts. Here, we designed a mini-barcode for catfishes comprising several species and many cryptic taxa. We analysed a data set of 3048 publicly available COI barcode sequences representing 547 worldwide catfish species and performed 152 628 interspecies comparisons. A significantly more positively correlated interspecies distance was detected with transversion (0.78, P < 0.001) than with transition (0.70, P < 0.001). This suggested that transversions were better diagnostics for species identification. In the aligned data set, two transversion-rich fragments (53 bp and 119 bp) were identified. Transition/transversion bias value was 1.04 in 53-bp fragment, 1.23 in 119-bp fragment and 1.50 in full-length barcode. The interspecies distance with full-length barcode was 0.212 ± 0.037, while that with 53-bp and 119-bp fragments was 0.325 ± 0.039 and 0.218 ± 0.045, respectively. Survey of 53-bp fragment showed a possibility of only 1144 barcodes, while that of 119-bp fragment showed >4 million barcodes. Thus, the 119-bp fragment is a viable mini-barcode for catfishes comprising >3000 extant species. Experiment with 82 archived catfishes showed successful recovery of this mini-barcode using the designed primer. The mini-barcode sequences showed species-specific similarity in the range of 98-100% with the global database. Therefore, survey of a transversion-rich fragment within the full-length barcode would be an ideal approach of mini-barcode design for biodiversity assessment.",

The phylogenetic relationship of Manipuri pony with the other breeds is unknown. The diversity in the mitochondrial (mt) DNA D-loop region is employed as an important tool to understand the origin and genetic diversification of domestic horses and to examine genetic relationships among breeds around the world. This study was carried out to understand the maternal lineages of Manipuri pony using the 247 bp region of the mtDNA D-loop. The dataset comprised of eleven numbers of self developed sequences of Manipuri pony, 59 and 35 number of retrieved sequences of Indian horse breeds and other worldwide breeds respectively. A total of 35 haplotypes was identified with a high level of genetic diversity in the Indian breeds. A total of seven major mtDNA haplogroups (A-G) was identified in the Indian horse breeds that indicated the abundance of mtDNA diversity and multiple origins of maternal lineages in them. The majority of the studied sequences of Indian breeds (33.3 %) were grouped into haplogroup D and least (3.9 %) in haplogroup E. The Manipuri breed showed the least FST distance (0.03866) with the most diverged Indian breeds and with Thoroughbred horse among the worldwide. This study indicated a close association between Manipuri pony and Thoroughbred.",

        "Abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) develops as a result of complex epigenetic, genetic and environmental interactions. Epigenetic changes like, promoter hypermethylation of multiple tumour suppressor genes are frequent events in cancer, and certain habit-related carcinogens are thought to be capable of inducing aberrant methylation. However, the effects of environmental carcinogens depend upon the level of metabolism by carcinogen metabolizing enzymes. As such key interactions between habits related factors and carcinogen metabolizing gene polymorphisms towards modulating promoter methylation of genes are likely. However, this remains largely unexplored in ESCC. Here, we studied the interaction of various habits related factors and polymorphism of GSTM1/GSTT1 genes towards inducing promoter hypermethylation of multiple tumour suppressor genes.",

NF-κB signaling is involved in both immune cell development and function, and it is critical in modulation of the immune response through the transcriptional regulation of cytokine and chemokine expression. An area of great interest in T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity is the ability of naive CD4(+) T cells generated in the thymus to differentiate into various subsets including T-helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, Th9, follicular helper T (Tfh), Th22, and regulatory T (Treg) cells, upon encountering different pathogens and microenvironments. In this review, we discuss the role of NF-κB pathway in the development and functional divergence of the different helper T-cell subsets as well as in regulatory T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) plays an important role in integrating the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and CD28 signals to achieve efficient NF-κB activation. PDK1 is also an important regulator of T cell development, mediating pre-TCR induced proliferation signals. However, the role of PDK1 in B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling and B cell development remains largely unknown. In this study we provide genetic evidence supporting the role of PDK1 in B cell survival. We found PDK1 is required for BCR mediated survival in resting B cells, likely through regulation of Foxo activation. PDK1-dependent signaling to NF-κB is not crucial to resting B cell viability. However, PDK1 is necessary for triggering NF-κB during B cell activation and is required for activated B cell survival. Together these studies demonstrate that PDK1 is essential for BCR-induced signal transduction to Foxo and NF-κB and is indispensable for both resting and activated B cell survival.",

The complete mitochondrial genome was sequenced using PGM™ from 10 patients matched blood and tumour tissue. Overall, 26 somatic mutations were found of which nine mutations in d-loop and 17 mutations in the coding region. The mutations at nucleotide positions 16294, 16325 and 16463 in d-loop and 4136, 13542 and 13869 in coding region are probably an indication to be a hot spot mutation in oral cancer.

        "Abstract": "Around 1.35 million people of worldwide suffer from breast cancer each year, whereas in India, 1 in every 17 women develops the disease. Mutations of the Breast Cancer 1 (BRCA1) gene account for the majority of breast/ ovarian cancer families. The purpose of study was to provide a prevalence of BRCA1 germline mutations in the North-East Indian population. In relation to the personal and family history with the breast cancer, we found mutations in 6.25% and 12.5% respectively. Three mutations, 185DelAG, 1014DelGT and 3889DelAG, were observed in our North-East Indian patients in exons 2 and 11, resulting in truncation of the BRCA1 protein by forming stop codons individually at amino acid positions 39, 303 and 1265. Our results point to a necessity for an extensive mutation screening study of high risk breast cancer cases in our North-East Indian population, which will provide better decisive medical and surgical preventive options.",

        "Abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent inducer of inflammation. However, in a phenomenon known as LPS tolerance, prolonged exposure to LPS reprograms the host response to subsequent LPS reexposure. Proinflammatory cytokine production is suppressed, while production of antimicrobial genes is increased. In vivo models suggest that LPS tolerance dramatically reduces susceptibility to septic shock, while keeping the capacity for clearance of certain pathogens intact. These observations imply that artificial induction of tolerance may be an attractive means to intervene in the progression of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms that govern the tolerogenic response remain poorly understood, hindering efforts to evaluate LPS tolerance induction as a therapeutic approach. Recent advances indicate that chromatin modifications and microRNA mediators may be particularly important in the tolerogenic response. In this review, we discuss possible mechanisms to account for the phenomenon of LPS tolerance, with particular emphasis on the role of newly identified mediators.",

Tobacco consumption in various forms is one of the major risk factors for the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma which makes the mitochondrial DNA susceptible to damage by reactive oxygen species.

        "Abstract": "Toll-like receptor 11 (TLR11) recognizes T. gondii profilin (TgPRF) and is required for interleukin-12 production and induction of immune responses that limit cyst burden in Toxoplasma gondii-infected mice. However, TLR11 only modestly affects survival of T. gondii-challenged mice. We report that TLR12, a previously uncharacterized TLR, also recognized TgPRF. TLR12 was sufficient for recognition of TgPRF by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), whereas TLR11 and TLR12 were both required in macrophages and conventional DCs. In contrast to TLR11, TLR12-deficient mice succumb rapidly to T. gondii infection. TLR12-dependent induction of IL-12 and IFN-α in pDCs led to production of IFN-γ by NK cells. Consistent with this observation, the partial resistance of Tlr11(-/-) mice is lost upon pDC or NK cell depletion. Thus, TLR12 is critical for the innate immune response to T. gondii, and this TLR may promote host resistance by triggering pDC and NK cell function.",

We now report that flagellin from Salmonella spp. is recognized in mouse intestine by Toll-like receptor 11 (TLR11). Absence of TLR11 renders mice more susceptible to infection by S. Typhimurium, with increased dissemination of the bacteria and enhanced lethality. Unlike S. Typhimurium, S. Typhi, a human obligatory pathogen that causes typhoid fever, is normally unable to infect mice. TLR11 is expressed in mice, but not in humans, and remarkably, we find that tlr11(-/-) mice are efficiently infected with orally administered S. Typhi. We also find that tlr11(-/-) mice can be immunized against S. Typhi. Therefore, tlr11(-/-) mice represent a small-animal model for the study of the immune response to S. Typhi and for the development of vaccines against this important human pathogen.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to sense and adjust to the environment is crucial to life. For multicellular organisms, the ability to respond to external changes is essential not only for survival but also for normal development and physiology. Although signaling events can directly modify cellular function, typically signaling acts to alter transcriptional responses to generate both transient and sustained changes. Rapid, but transient, changes in gene expression are mediated by inducible transcription factors such as NF-κB. For the past 25 years, NF-κB has served as a paradigm for inducible transcription factors and has provided numerous insights into how signaling events influence gene expression and physiology. Since its discovery as a regulator of expression of the κ light chain gene in B cells, research on NF-κB continues to yield new insights into fundamental cellular processes. Advances in understanding the mechanisms that regulate NF-κB have been accompanied by progress in elucidating the biological significance of this transcription factor in various physiological processes. NF-κB likely plays the most prominent role in the development and function of the immune system and, not surprisingly, when dysregulated, contributes to the pathophysiology of inflammatory disease. As our appreciation of the fundamental role of inflammation in disease pathogenesis has increased, so too has the importance of NF-κB as a key regulatory molecule gained progressively greater significance. However, despite the tremendous progress that has been made in understanding the regulation of NF-κB, there is much that remains to be understood. In this review, we highlight both the progress that has been made and the fundamental questions that remain unanswered after 25 years of study.",

Recent research has demonstrated that mitochondria participate in a broad range of innate immune pathways, functioning as signalling platforms and contributing to effector responses. In addition to regulating antiviral signalling, mounting evidence suggests that mitochondria facilitate antibacterial immunity by generating reactive oxygen species and contribute to innate immune activation following cellular damage and stress. Therefore, in addition to their well-appreciated roles in cellular metabolism and programmed cell death, mitochondria appear to function as centrally positioned hubs in the innate immune system. Here, we review the emerging knowledge about the roles of mitochondria in innate immunity.",

        "Title": "TLR signalling augments macrophage bactericidal activity through mitochondrial ROS.",
        "Abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential components of the innate immune response against intracellular bacteria and it is thought that professional phagocytes generate ROS primarily via the phagosomal NADPH oxidase machinery. However, recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial ROS (mROS) also contribute to mouse macrophage bactericidal activity, although the mechanisms linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria for mROS generation remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that engagement of a subset of Toll-like receptors (TLR1, TLR2 and TLR4) results in the recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes and augments mROS production. This response involves translocation of a TLR signalling adaptor, tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), to mitochondria, where it engages the protein ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signalling intermediate in Toll pathways), which is implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly. Interaction with TRAF6 leads to ECSIT ubiquitination and enrichment at the mitochondrial periphery, resulting in increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS generation. ECSIT- and TRAF6-depleted macrophages have decreased levels of TLR-induced ROS and are significantly impaired in their ability to kill intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reducing macrophage mROS levels by expressing catalase in mitochondria results in defective bacterial killing, confirming the role of mROS in bactericidal activity. These results reveal a novel pathway linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria, implicate mROS as an important component of antibacterial responses and further establish mitochondria as hubs for innate immune signalling.",

Deletion of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1) in T cells via Cd4-Cre induced chronic inflammation of the intestine despite the importance of PDK1 in T cell activation. Analysis of colonic intraepithelial lymphocytes of PDK1-deficient mice revealed markedly increased CD8α(+) T cell receptor (TCR)γδ(+) T cells, including an interleukin-17 (IL-17)-expressing population. TCRγδ(+) T cells were responsible for the inflammatory colitis as shown by the fact that deletion of Tcrd abolished spontaneous colitis in the PDK1-deficient mice. This dysregulation of intestinal TCRγδ(+) T cells was attributable to a reduction in the number and functional capacity of PDK1-deficient T regulatory (Treg) cells. Adoptive transfer of wild-type Treg cells abrogated the spontaneous activation and proliferation of intestinal TCRγδ(+) T cells observed in PDK1-deficient mice and prevented the development of colitis. Therefore, suppression of intestinal TCRγδ(+) T cells by Treg cells maintains enteric immune tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "The activation of pro-inflammatory gene programs by nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is primarily regulated through cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-kappaB by the inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) family of proteins. IkappaBbeta, a major isoform of IkappaB, can sequester NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm, although its biological role remains unclear. Although cells lacking IkappaBbeta have been reported, in vivo studies have been limited and suggested redundancy between IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta. Like IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta is also inducibly degraded; however, upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), it is degraded slowly and re-synthesized as a hypophosphorylated form that can be detected in the nucleus. The crystal structure of IkappaBbeta bound to p65 suggested this complex might bind DNA. In vitro, hypophosphorylated IkappaBbeta can bind DNA with p65 and c-Rel, and the DNA-bound NF-kappaB:IkappaBbeta complexes are resistant to IkappaBalpha, suggesting hypophosphorylated, nuclear IkappaBbeta may prolong the expression of certain genes. Here we report that in vivo IkappaBbeta serves both to inhibit and facilitate the inflammatory response. IkappaBbeta degradation releases NF-kappaB dimers which upregulate pro-inflammatory target genes such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Surprisingly, absence of IkappaBbeta results in a dramatic reduction of TNF-alpha in response to LPS even though activation of NF-kappaB is normal. The inhibition of TNF-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) expression correlates with the absence of nuclear, hypophosphorylated-IkappaBbeta bound to p65:c-Rel heterodimers at a specific kappaB site on the TNF-alpha promoter. Therefore IkappaBbeta acts through p65:c-Rel dimers to maintain prolonged expression of TNF-alpha. As a result, IkappaBbeta(-/-) mice are resistant to LPS-induced septic shock and collagen-induced arthritis. Blocking IkappaBbeta might be a promising new strategy for selectively inhibiting the chronic phase of TNF-alpha production during the inflammatory response.",

        "Abstract": "NF-kappaB is well established as a key component of the inflammatory response. However, the precise mechanisms through which NF-kappaB activation contributes to inflammatory disease states remain poorly defined. To test the role of NF-kappaB in inflammation, we created a knock-in mouse that expresses a constitutively active form of NF-kappaB p65 dimers. These mice are born at normal Mendelian ratios, but display a progressive, systemic hyperinflammatory condition that results in severe runting and, typically, death 8-20 d after birth. Examination of homozygous knock-in mice demonstrates significant increases in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Remarkably, crossing this strain with mice lacking TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) leads to a complete rescue of the hyperinflammatory phenotype. However, upon aging, these rescued mice begin to display chronic keratitis accompanied by increased corneal expression of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and MMP-9, similar to that seen in human keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) or \"dry eyes.\" Therefore, our results show that, while constitutively active NF-kappaB can trigger systemic inflammation, it does so indirectly, through increased TNF production. However, certain inflammatory disease states, such as keratitis or KCS, a condition that is seen in Sjogren's syndrome, are dependent on NF-kappaB, but are independent of TNFR1 signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) consists of a family of transcription factors that play critical roles in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Inducible NF-kappaB activation depends on phosphorylation-induced proteosomal degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB proteins (IkappaBs), which retain inactive NF-kappaB dimers in the cytosol in unstimulated cells. The majority of the diverse signaling pathways that lead to NF-kappaB activation converge on the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, which is responsible for IkappaB phosphorylation and is essential for signal transduction to NF-kappaB. Additional regulation of NF-kappaB activity is achieved through various post-translational modifications of the core components of the NF-kappaB signaling pathways. In addition to cytosolic modifications of IKK and IkappaB proteins, as well as other pathway-specific mediators, the transcription factors are themselves extensively modified. Tremendous progress has been made over the last two decades in unraveling the elaborate regulatory networks that control the NF-kappaB response. This has made the NF-kappaB pathway a paradigm for understanding general principles of signal transduction and gene regulation.",

Here, we found that enhancing nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity via a constitutive active inhibitor of kappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) transgene in T cells led to increased number of Foxp3(+) cells in the thymus and can rescue Foxp3 expression in thymocytes deficient in other pleiotropic signaling molecules. Enhancing the signal strength of the NF-kappaB pathway also induced Foxp3 expression in otherwise conventionally selected T cells. NF-kappaB directly promoted the transcription of Foxp3, and upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, c-Rel, a NF-kappaB family member, bound to Foxp3 enhancer region, which is specifically demethylated in natural Treg cells. Hence, NF-kappaB signaling pathway is a key regulator of Foxp3 expression during natural Treg cell development.",

        "Abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Brucella species cause chronic infections that can result in undulant fever, arthritis, and osteomyelitis in humans. Remarkably, Brucella sp. genomes encode a protein, named TcpB, that bears significant homology with mammalian Toll/IL-1 receptor domains and whose expression causes degradation of the phosphorylated, signal competent form of the adapter MyD88-adapter-like (MAL). This effect of TcpB is mediated through its box 1 region and has no effect on other TLR adapter proteins such as MyD88 or TIR-domain containing adapter protein-inducing IFNbeta. TcpB also does not affect a mutant, signal-incompetent form of MAL that cannot be phosphorylated. Interestingly, the presence of TcpB leads to enhanced polyubiquitination of MAL, which is likely responsible for its accelerated degradation. A Brucella abortus mutant lacking TcpB fails to reduce levels of MAL in infected macrophages. Therefore, TcpB represents a unique pathogen-derived molecule that suppresses host innate-immune responses by specifically targeting an individual adapter molecule in the TLR signaling pathway for degradation.",

We show here that phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is essential for integrating the TCR and CD28 signals. After we deleted PDK1 from T cells, TCR-CD28 signals were unable to induce activation of NF-kappaB or phosphorylation of protein kinase C-theta, although T cell survival and pathways dependent on the kinases p38 and Jnk or the transcription factor NFAT were unaffected. CD28 facilitated NF-kappaB activation by regulating recruitment and phosphorylation of PDK1, which are necessary for efficient binding of PDK1 to protein kinase C-theta and the adaptor CARMA1 and thus for NF-kappaB induction.",

        "Title": "Differential role of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in selection and survival of CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity leads to a reduction in numbers of CD8(+) single-positive (SP) thymocytes, suggesting a selective role for NF-kappaB in these cells. To further explore the role of NF-kappaB in SP thymocytes, we utilized transgenic models that allowed either inhibition or activation of NF-kappaB. We showed that activation of NF-kappaB played an important role in the selection of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted CD8(+) T cells. Surprisingly, NF-kappaB was not activated in positively selected CD4(+) thymocytes, and inhibition of NF-kappaB did not perturb positive or negative selection of CD4(+) cells. However, enforced activation of NF-kappaB via a constitutively active inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) kinase transgene led to a nearly complete deletion of CD4 cells by pushing positively selecting CD4(+) cells into negative selection. These studies therefore revealed a surprising difference of NF-kappaB activation in CD4(+) and CD8(+) thymocytes and suggested that NF-kappaB contributes to the establishment of thresholds of signaling that determine positive or negative selection of thymocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Research on the biological function of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), a key mediator of inducible transcription in the immune system, has traditionally focused on its role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses. These studies have largely concentrated on the mechanisms of signalling that lead to NF-kappaB activation and on the positive role of NF-kappaB in both physiological immunity and pathological inflammation. More recently, there has been growing interest in the mechanisms that directly regulate the NF-kappaB transcriptional programmes. As a result, several new NF-kappaB regulatory components have been identified and some of the known components have been assigned new roles. In this Review, we discuss these new insights into the regulation of NF-kappaB.",

        "Abstract": "Cells from a \"knock-in\" mouse expressing a NF-kappaB p65 mutant bearing an alanine instead of serine at position 276 (S276A) display a significant reduction of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, even though the mutant p65 forms appropriate complexes that translocate normally to the nucleus and bind to DNA. Surprisingly, however, instead of the expected embryonic lethality from hepatocyte apoptosis seen in the absence of NF-kappaB activity, the S276A knock-in embryos die at different embryonic days due to variegated developmental abnormalities. We now demonstrate that this variegated phenotype is due to epigenetic repression resulting from the recruitment of histone deacetylases by the nonphosphorylatable form of NF-kappaB into the vicinity of genes positioned fortuitously near NF-kappaB-binding sites. Therefore, unphosphorylated nuclear NF-kappaB can affect expression of genes not normally regulated by NF-kappaB through epigenetic mechanisms.",

        "Title": "Phosphorylation of serine 68 in the IkappaB kinase (IKK)-binding domain of NEMO interferes with the structure of the IKK complex and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity.",
        "Abstract": "The IkappaB-Kinase (IKK) complex is a multisubunit protein complex crucial for signal-induced phosphorylation of the IkappaB proteins and thus controls the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Besides the two kinases IKKalpha and IKKbeta, the IKK complex contains NEMO/IKKgamma, an additional subunit with regulatory and adaptor functions. NEMO not only confers structural stability to the IKK complex but also participates in the activation process of the IKK complex by linking the IKK subunits to upstream activators. In this study we analyze the IKKbeta-mediated phosphorylation of the IKK-binding domain of NEMO. In vitro, IKKbeta phosphorylates three serine residues in the domain of NEMO at positions 43, 68, and 85. However, mutational analysis revealed that only the phosphorylation of serine 68 in the center of the IKK-binding domain plays an essential role for the formation and the function of the IKK complex. Thus, Ser(68) phosphorylation attenuates the amino-terminal dimerization of NEMO as well as the IKKbeta-NEMO interaction. In contrast, the NEMO-IKKalpha interaction was only mildly affected by the phosphorylation of Ser(68). However, functional analysis revealed that Ser(68) phosphorylation primarily affects the activity of IKKalpha. Furthermore, in complementation experiments of NEMO-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, a S68A-NEMO mutant enhanced, whereas a S68E mutant decreased, TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity, thus emphasizing the inhibitory role of the Ser(68) phosphorylation on the signal-induced NF-kappaB activity. Finally, we provide evidence that the protein phosphatase PP2A is involved in the regulation of the Ser(68)-based mechanism. In summary, we provide evidence for a signal-induced phosphorylation-dependent alteration of the IKK complex emphasizing the dynamic nature of this multisubunit kinase complex.",

        "Abstract": "Signal transduction events leading to the survival, differentiation, or apoptosis of cells of the innate or adaptive immune system must be properly coordinated to ensure the normal mounting and termination of immune responses. One of the key transcription factors in immune responses is nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), which has been the focus of intense investigation over the past two decades. With the identification of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex and ongoing progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms connecting T cell and B cell receptor proximal signals to the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, a cohesive model of antigen receptor (AgR)-dependent signaling to NF-kappaB activation is beginning to emerge. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of research into the mechanisms that regulate AgR-mediated NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, with particular focus on the events leading to activation of the IKK complex.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that peptides corresponding to a six-amino-acid NEMO-binding domain from the C terminus of IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) and IKKbeta can disrupt the IKK complex and block NF-kappaB activation. We have now mapped and characterized the corresponding amino-terminal IKK-binding domain (IBD) of NEMO. Peptides corresponding to the IBD were efficiently recruited to the IKK complex but displayed only a weak inhibitory potential on cytokine-induced NF-kappaB activity. This is most likely due to the formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate- and urea-resistant NEMO dimers through a dimerization domain at the amino terminus of NEMO that overlaps with the region responsible for binding to IKKs. Mutational analysis revealed different alpha-helical subdomains within an amino-terminal coiled-coil region are important for NEMO dimerization and IKKbeta binding. Furthermore, NEMO dimerization is required for the tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, even when interaction with the IKKs is unaffected. Hence, our data provide novel insights into the role of the amino terminus of NEMO for the architecture of the IKK complex and its activation.",

        "Abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane proteins that detect invading pathogens by binding conserved, microbially derived molecules and that induce signaling cascades for proinflammatory gene expression. A critical component of the innate immune system, TLRs utilize leucine-rich-repeat motifs for ligand binding and a shared cytoplasmic domain to recruit the adaptors MyD88, TRIF, TIRAP, and/or TRAM for downstream signaling. Despite significant domain conservation, TLRs induce gene programs that lead not only to the robust production of general proinflammatory mediators but also to the production of unique effectors, which provide pathogen-tailored immune responses. Here we review the mechanisms by which TLRs recognize pathogens and induce distinct signaling cascades.",

        "Abstract": "Charged MVB protein 5 (CHMP5) is a coiled coil protein homologous to the yeast Vps60/Mos10 gene and other ESCRT-III complex members, although its precise function in either yeast or mammalian cells is unknown. We deleted the CHMP5 gene in mice, resulting in a phenotype of early embryonic lethality, reflecting defective late endosome function and dysregulation of signal transduction. Chmp5-/- cells exhibit enlarged late endosomal compartments that contain abundant internal vesicles expressing proteins that are characteristic of late endosomes and lysosomes. This is in contrast to ESCRT-III mutants in yeast, which are defective in multivesicular body (MVB) formation. The degradative capacity of Chmp5-/- cells was reduced, and undigested proteins from multiple pathways accumulated in enlarged MVBs that failed to traffic their cargo to lysosomes. Therefore, CHMP5 regulates late endosome function downstream of MVB formation, and the loss of CHMP5 enhances signal transduction by inhibiting lysosomal degradation of activated receptors.",

        "Title": "Role of nuclear factor-kappaB in the immune system and bone.",
        "Abstract": "Bone metabolism is regulated by hormonal or local factors in the bone microenvironment, and recent studies have revealed that bone homeostasis is also influenced by immune system. The term 'osteoimmunology' has been proposed to explain the cross-talk between bone and the immune system. A critical element in this cross-talk is the inducible transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which regulates gene expression during inflammatory and immune responses. However, NF-kappaB-signaling pathways are also important for bone homeostasis, in particular for osteoclast differentiation. By bridging inflammation and bone homeostasis, NF-kappaB also contributes to the onset and progression of arthritis. Several natural compounds, synthetic drugs, and gene-transfer technologies that lead to inhibition of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB activation pathway can prevent arthritis in animal models. In this review, we discuss the signaling pathway that leads to NF-kappaB activation and the role of NF-kappaB on osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that inhibition of NF-kappaB might provide novel therapeutic approach for inhibiting bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "Title": "TAK1, but not TAB1 or TAB2, plays an essential role in multiple signaling pathways in vivo.",
        "Abstract": "TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the MAPKKK family, is thought to be a key modulator of the inducible transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1 and, therefore, plays a crucial role in regulating the genes that mediate inflammation. Although in vitro biochemical studies have revealed the existence of a TAK1 complex, which includes TAK1 and the adapter proteins TAB1 and TAB2, it remains unclear which members of this complex are essential for signaling. To analyze the function of TAK1 in vivo, we have deleted the Tak1 gene in mice, with the resulting phenotype being early embryonic lethality. Using embryonic fibroblasts lacking TAK1, TAB1, or TAB2, we have found that TNFR1, IL-1R, TLR3, and TLR4-mediated NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation are severely impaired in Tak1(m/m) cells, but they are normal in Tab1(-/-) and Tab2(-/-) cells. In addition, Tak1(m/m) cells are highly sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis. TAK1 mediates IKK activation in TNF-alpha and IL-1 signaling pathways, where it functions downstream of RIP1-TRAF2 and MyD88-IRAK1-TRAF6, respectively. However, TAK1 is not required for NF-kappaB activation through the alternative pathway following LT-beta signaling. In the TGF-beta signaling pathway, TAK1 deletion leads to impaired NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation without impacting Smad2 activation or TGF-beta-induced gene expression. Therefore, our studies suggests that TAK1 acts as an upstream activating kinase for IKKbeta and JNK, but not IKKalpha, revealing an unexpectedly specific role of TAK1 in inflammatory signaling pathways.",

        "Abstract": "The regulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) during B-cell development was examined using cells isolated from the bone marrow of transgenic mice expressing a kappaB luciferase reporter gene. The results indicate that the highest level of NF-kappaB activity is present in cells expressing the pre-B-cell receptor. Furthermore, cross-linking of Igbeta on CD43(+) pre-B cells is able to activate NF-kappaB in recombination-activating gene 1-deficient mice, preceding their further differentiation into CD43(-) pre-B cells. Expression of a dominant negative form of IkappaBalpha using a transgenic approach or by retroviral infection leads to a reduction in the number of CD43(+) pre-B cells. These data therefore indicate that activation of NF-kappaB in CD43(+) pre-B cells, as a result of signaling by the pre-B-cell receptor, facilitates the continued development of large, CD43(+) pre-B cells into small CD43(-) pre-B cells.",

        "Abstract": "Many signaling pathways regulate the activity of effector transcription factors by controlling their subcellular localization. Until recently, the cytoplasmic retention of inactive transcription factors was mainly attributed to binding partners that mask the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of target proteins. Inactive transcription factors were thought to be exclusively cytoplasmic until their activation, after which the NLSs were unmasked to allow nuclear translocation. There is now a growing body of evidence, however, that challenges this simple model. This review discusses recent reports that suggest that inducible transcription factors can constantly shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and that their apparent cytoplasmic retention can be achieved by binding partners that mask the NLSs, tether the transcription factor to cytoplasmic structures, or mark the transcription factor for proteasomal degradation. We also discuss the possibility that this more complex model of cytoplasmic retention might be applicable to a broader range of transcription factors and their associated signaling pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB after engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) is important for T cell proliferation and activation during the adaptive immune response. Recent reports have elucidated a signaling pathway that involves the protein kinase C (PKC), the scaffold protein CARD11 (also called CARMA-1), the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein Bcl10, and the paracaspase (protease related to caspases) MALT1 as critical intermediates linking the TCR to the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. However, the events proximal to the TCR that initiate the activation of this signaling pathway remain poorly defined. We demonstrate that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) has an essential role in this pathway by regulating the activation of PKC and through signal-dependent recruiting of both PKC and CARD11 to lipid rafts. PDK1-associated PKC recruits the IKK complex, whereas PDK1-associated CARD11 recruits the Bcl10-MALT1 complex, thereby allowing activation of the IKK complex through Bcl10-MALT1-dependent ubiquitination of the IKK complex subunit known as NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modifier). Hence, PDK1 plays a critical role by nucleating the TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation pathway in T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Activation of NF-kappaB requires two highly related kinases named IKKalpha and IKKbeta that share identity in the nature and positioning of their structural domains. Despite their similarity, the kinases are functionally divergent, and we therefore sought to identify any structural features specific for IKKalpha or IKKbeta. We performed bioinformatics analysis, and we identified a region resembling a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) that exists only in IKKbeta and that we named the UBL-like domain (ULD). Deletion of the ULD rendered IKKbeta catalytically inactive and unable to induce NF-kappaB activity, and overexpression of only the ULD dose-dependently inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity. The ULD could not be functionally replaced within IKKbeta by ubiquitin or the corresponding region of IKKalpha, whereas deletion of the equivalent section of IKKalpha did not affect its catalytic activity against IkappaBalpha or its activation by NF-kappaB-inducing kinase. We identified five residues conserved among the larger family of UBL-containing proteins and IKKbeta, and alanine scanning revealed that the leucine at position 353 (Leu(353)) is absolutely critical for IKKbeta-induced NF-kappaB activation. Most intriguingly, the L353A mutant was catalytically active but, unlike wild-type IKKbeta, formed a stable complex with the NF-kappaB p65 subunit. Our findings therefore establish the ULD as a critical functional domain specific for IKKbeta that might play a role in dissociating IKKbeta from p65.",

        "Abstract": "It has been shown previously that the transcription factor NF-kappaB and its inhibitor IkappaBalpha shuttle constitutively between cytosol and nucleus. Moreover, we have recently demonstrated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase NIK, a component of the NF-kappaB pathway, which is essential for lymph node development and B-cell function. Here we show that nuclear NIK also occurs in nucleoli and that this localization is mediated by a stretch of basic amino acids in the N-terminal part of the protein (R(143)-K-K-R-K-K-K(149)). This motif is necessary and sufficient for nucleolar localization of NIK, as judged by nuclear localization of mutant versions of the full-length protein and the fact that coupling of these seven amino acids to GFP also leads to accumulation in nucleoli. Using fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) approaches, we demonstrate a dynamic distribution between nucleoli and nucleoplasm and a high mobility of NIK in both compartments. Together with the nuclear export signal in the C-terminal portion of NIK that we have also characterized in detail, the nuclear/nucleolar targeting signals of NIK mediate dynamic circulation of the protein between the cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic and nucleolar compartments. We demonstrate that nuclear NIK is capable of activating NF-kappaB and that this effect is diminished by nucleolar localization. Thus, subcellular distribution of NIK to different compartments might be a means of regulating the function of this kinase.",

Gene targeting studies have shown that the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) has a crucial role in osteoclast differentiation, and blocking NF-kappa B is a potential strategy for preventing inflammatory bone resorption. We tested this approach using a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of the I kappa B-kinase complex, a crucial component of signal transduction pathways to NF-kappa B. The peptide inhibited RANKL-stimulated NF-kappa B activation and osteoclastogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, this peptide significantly reduced the severity of collagen-induced arthritis in mice by reducing levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta, abrogating joint swelling and reducing destruction of bone and cartilage. Therefore, selective inhibition of NF-kappa B activation offers an effective therapeutic approach for inhibiting chronic inflammatory diseases involving bone resorption.",

Cells expressing TLR11 fail to respond to known TLR ligands but instead respond specifically to uropathogenic bacteria.

        "Abstract": "The application of anti-inflammatory therapies began thousands of years ago with the use of readily available natural resources. It is only recently, however, that the cellular and molecular mechanisms of inflammation have been appreciated sufficiently to design anti-inflammatory strategies with limited side effects. For example, salicylates and glucocorticoids, two widely used anti-inflammatory drug classes, are now known to inhibit the activation of NF-kappa B, a transcription factor that regulates the inducible expression of a wide range of proinflammatory mediators. New generations of NF-kappa B-targeting anti-inflammatory agents that are specific, efficacious, and cost-effective may therefore complement or replace current therapies. In this review, we describe various classes of NF-kappa B inhibitors and discuss important unresolved issues regarding their use.",

        "Abstract": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) are members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) superfamily that play critical roles during mouse embryogenesis. Signaling by Bmp receptors is mediated mainly by Smad proteins. In this study, we show that a targeted null mutation of Ecsit, encoding a signaling intermediate of the Toll pathway, leads to reduced cell proliferation, altered epiblast patterning, impairment of mesoderm formation, and embryonic lethality at embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5), phenotypes that mimic the Bmp receptor type1a (Bmpr1a) null mutant. In addition, specific Bmp target gene expression is abolished in the absence of Ecsit. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that Ecsit associates constitutively with Smad4 and associates with Smad1 in a Bmp-inducible manner. Together with Smad1 and Smad4, Ecsit binds to the promoter of specific Bmp target genes. Finally, knock-down of Ecsit with Ecsit-specific short hairpin RNA inhibits both Bmp and Toll signaling. Therefore, these results show that Ecsit functions as an essential component in two important signal transduction pathways and establishes a novel role for Ecsit as a cofactor for Smad proteins in the Bmp signaling pathway.",

        "Title": "Differential phosphorylation of the signal-responsive domain of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta by I kappa B kinases.",
        "Abstract": "NF-kappa B activity is regulated by its association with the inhibitory I kappa B proteins, among which I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta are the most abundant. I kappa B proteins are widely expressed in different cells and tissues and bind to similar combinations of NF-kappa B proteins. The degradation of I kappa B proteins allows nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B and hence plays a critical role in NF-kappa B activation. Previous studies have demonstrated that, although both I kappa B proteins are phosphorylated by the same I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex, and their ubiquitination and degradation following phosphorylation are carried out by the same ubiquitination/degradation machinery, their kinetics of degradation are quite different. To better understand the underlying mechanism of the differences in degradation kinetics, we have carried out a systematic, comparative analysis of the ability of the IKK catalytic subunits to phosphorylate I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta. We found that, whereas IKK alpha is a weak kinase for the N-terminal serines of both I kappa B isoforms, IKK beta is an efficient kinase for those residues in I kappa B alpha. However, IKK beta phosphorylates the N-terminal serines of I kappa B beta far less efficiently, thereby providing an explanation for the slower rate of degradation observed for I kappa B beta. Mutational analysis indicated that the regions around the two N-terminal serines collectively influence the relative phosphorylation efficiency, and no individual residue is critical. These findings provide the first systematic analysis of the ability of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta to serve as substrates for IKKs and help provide a possible explanation for the differential degradation kinetics of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta.",

Both IkappaBs bind to the same NF-kappaB dimers and are widely expressed in different cells and tissues. To better understand how these two IkappaB isoforms differ biologically, we have characterized the expression of IkappaBbeta in testis, a tissue in which IkappaBalpha is only minimally expressed. We have found that IkappaBbeta expression is localized within the haploid spermatid stages of spermatogenesis and follows the expression of nuclear NF-kappaB. IkappaBbeta expression in haploid spermatids is likely regulated by Sox family proteins, members of which are also expressed within spermatids. We have shown that both SRY and Sox-5 can bind to multiple Sox binding sites found within the IkappaBbeta promoter and can enhance transcription of a reporter gene in transient transfection assays. We also demonstrate that IkappaBbeta mRNA is strongly expressed in developing male gonads. These results therefore suggest that IkappaBbeta may be a novel target for transcription factors of the HMG-box SRY/Sox family and imply a potential role for NF-kappaB/IkappaBbeta in spermatogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Proinflammatory activation of NF-kappaB requires an upstream kinase complex (IkappaB-kinase; IKK) composed of two catalytic subunits (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and a noncatalytic regulatory component named NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator). NEMO interacts with a COOH-terminal sequence within both IKKs termed the NEMO-binding domain (NBD), and a cell-permeable NBD peptide blocks NEMO/IKKbeta interactions and inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB. We report here that a peptide encompassing the NBD not only blocked association of both IKKs with NEMO but also disrupted preformed NEMO/IKK complexes in vitro. Furthermore, peptide blocking and alanine-scanning mutation studies revealed differences between the NBDs of IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and mutational analysis of the IKKbeta NBD identified the physical properties required at each position to maintain association with NEMO. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of NEMO-binding by IKKbeta through deletion of the NBD renders it catalytically active and that potential phosphorylation within the IKKbeta NBD may serve as a signal to down-regulate IKK activity. Our findings therefore provide critical insight into the physical properties of the NBD that will be valuable for the design of drugs aimed at disrupting the IKK complex and also reveal potential regulatory mechanisms controlling the function of the IKK complex.",

        "Abstract": "Homodimers of the NF-kappa B p50 subunit are transcriptionally repressive in cells, whereas they can promote transcription in vitro, suggesting that their endogenous effects are mediated by association with other factors. We now demonstrate that transcriptionally inactive nuclear NF-kappaB in resting cells consists of homodimers of either p65 or p50 complexed with the histone deacetylase HDAC-1. Only the p50-HDAC-1 complexes bind to DNA and suppress NF-kappa B-dependent gene expression in unstimulated cells. Appropriate stimulation causes nuclear localization of NF-kappa B complexes containing phosphorylated p65 that associates with CBP and displaces the p50-HDAC-1 complexes. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation of p65 determines whether it associates with either CBP or HDAC-1, ensuring that only p65 entering the nucleus from cytoplasmic NF-kappa B:Ikappa B complexes can activate transcription.",

        "Abstract": "Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated recognition of pathogens represents one of the most important mechanisms of innate immunity and disease resistance. The adaptor protein Tollip was identified initially as an intermediate in interleukin (IL)-1 signaling. Here we report that Tollip also associates directly with TLR2 and TLR4 and plays an inhibitory role in TLR-mediated cell activation. Inhibition by Tollip is mediated through its ability to potently suppress the activity of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) after TLR activation. In addition, we show for the first time that Tollip is a bona fide substrate for IRAK and is phosphorylated by IRAK upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or IL-1. Negative regulation of TLR signaling by Tollip may therefore serve to limit the production of proinflammatory mediators during inflammation and infection.",
