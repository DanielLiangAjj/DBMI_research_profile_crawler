        "Abstract": "Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) uses images of frozen hydrated biological specimens to produce macromolecular structures, opening up previously inaccessible levels of biological organization to high-resolution structural analysis. CryoEM has the potential for broad impact in biomedical research, including basic cell, molecular, and structural biology, and increasingly in drug discovery and vaccine development. Recent advances have led to the expansion of molecular and cellular structure determination at an exponential rate. National and regional centers have emerged to support this growth by increasing the accessibility of cryoEM throughout the biomedical research community. Through cooperation and synergy, these centers form a network of resources that accelerate the adoption of best practices for access and training and establish sustainable workflows to build future research capacity.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in instrumentation and software for cryoEM have increased the applicability and utility of this method. High levels of automation and faster data acquisition rates require hard decisions to be made regarding data retention. Here we investigate the efficacy of data compression applied to aligned summed movie files. Surprisingly, these images can be compressed using a standard lossy method that reduces file storage by 90-95% and yet can still be processed to provide sub-2 Å reconstructed maps. We do not advocate this as an archival method, but it may provide a useful means for retaining images as an historical record, especially at large facilities.",

Here we describe the genetic modification and structural characterization of the Leviviridae PP7 capsid protein as a platform for the presentation of functional polypeptides. This particle was shown to tolerate the display of sequences from 1 kDa (a cell penetrating peptide) to 14 kDa (the Fc-binding double Z-domain) on its exterior surface as C-terminal genetic fusions to the coat protein. In addition, a dimeric construct allowed the presentation of exogenous loops between capsid monomers and the simultaneous presentation of two different peptides at different positions on the icosahedral structure. The PP7 particle is thereby significantly more tolerant of these types of polypeptide additions than Qβ and MS2, the other Leviviridae-derived VLPs in common use.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in instrumentation and automation have made cryo-EM a popular method for producing near-atomic resolution structures of a variety of proteins and complexes. Sample preparation is still a limiting factor in collecting high quality data. Thickness of the vitreous ice in which the particles are embedded is one of the many variables that need to be optimized for collection of the highest quality data. Here we present two methods, using either an energy filter or scattering outside the objective aperture, to measure ice thickness for potentially every image collected. Unlike geometrical or tomographic methods, these can be implemented directly in the single particle collection workflow without interrupting or significantly slowing down data collection. We describe the methods as implemented into the Leginon/Appion data collection workflow, along with some examples from test cases. Routine monitoring of ice thickness should prove helpful for optimizing sample preparation, data collection, and data processing.",

        "Abstract": "We have developed a self-blotting TEM grid for use with a novel instrument for vitrifying samples for cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). Nanowires are grown on the copper surface of the grid using a simple chemical reaction and the opposite smooth side is used to adhere to a holey sample substrate support, for example carbon or gold. When small volumes of sample are applied to the nanowire grids the wires effectively act as blotting paper to rapidly wick away the liquid, leaving behind a thin film. In this technical note, we present a detailed description of how we make these grids using a variety of substrates fenestrated with either lacey or regularly spaced holes. We explain how we characterize the quality of the grids and we describe their behavior under a variety of conditions.",

The system uses a liquid handling robot to place up to 96 individual samples onto a single standard TEM grid at separate locations. The grid is then transferred into the TEM and automated software is used to acquire multiscale images of each sample. The images are then analyzed to extract metrics on the size, shape, and morphology of the nanoparticles. The system has been used to characterize plasmonically active nanomaterials.",

        "Abstract": "NOSs are homodimeric multidomain enzymes responsible for producing NO. In mammals, NO acts as an intercellular messenger in a variety of signaling reactions, as well as a cytotoxin in the innate immune response. Mammals possess three NOS isoforms--inducible, endothelial, and neuronal NOS--that are composed of an N-terminal oxidase domain and a C-terminal reductase domain. Calmodulin (CaM) activates NO synthesis by binding to the helical region connecting these two domains. Although crystal structures of isolated domains have been reported, no structure is available for full-length NOS. We used high-throughput single-particle EM to obtain the structures and higher-order domain organization of all three NOS holoenzymes. The structures of inducible, endothelial, and neuronal NOS with and without CaM bound are similar, consisting of a dimerized oxidase domain flanked by two separated reductase domains. NOS isoforms adopt many conformations enabled by three flexible linkers. These conformations represent snapshots of the continuous electron transfer pathway from the reductase domain to the oxidase domain, which reveal that only a single reductase domain participates in electron transfer at a time, and that CaM activates NOS by constraining rotational motions and by directly binding to the oxidase domain. Direct visualization of these large conformational changes induced during electron transfer provides significant insight into the molecular underpinnings governing NO formation.",

        "Abstract": "Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is the primary nitric oxide (NO) receptor in mammals and a central component of the NO-signaling pathway. The NO-signaling pathways mediate diverse physiological processes, including vasodilation, neurotransmission, and myocardial functions. sGC is a heterodimer assembled from two homologous subunits, each comprised of four domains. Although crystal structures of isolated domains have been reported, no structure is available for full-length sGC. We used single-particle electron microscopy to obtain the structure of the complete sGC heterodimer and determine its higher-order domain architecture. Overall, the protein is formed of two rigid modules: the catalytic dimer and the clustered Per/Art/Sim and heme-NO/O2-binding domains, connected by a parallel coiled coil at two hinge points. The quaternary assembly demonstrates a very high degree of flexibility. We captured hundreds of individual conformational snapshots of free sGC, NO-bound sGC, and guanosine-5'-[(α,β)-methylene]triphosphate-bound sGC. The molecular architecture and pronounced flexibility observed provides a significant step forward in understanding the mechanism of NO signaling.",

We demonstrate the method using the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) VLPs in GARDASIL®. CryoTEM, coupled to automated data collection and analysis, was used to acquire images of the particles in their hydrated state, determine their morphological characteristics, and confirm the integrity of the particles when absorbed to aluminum adjuvant. In addition, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the VLPs, both alone and when interacting with neutralizing antibodies. Two modes of binding of two different neutralizing antibodies were apparent; for HPV type 11 saturated with H11.B2, 72 potential Fab binding sites were observed at the center of each capsomer, whereas for HPV 16 interacting with H16.V5, it appears that 60 pentamers (each neighboring 6 other pentamers) bind five Fabs per pentamer, for the total of 300 potential Fab binding sites per VLP.",

        "Abstract": "Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy is now well established as a technique for the structural characterization of large macromolecules and macromolecular complexes. The raw data is very noisy and consists of two-dimensional projections, from which the 3D biological object must be reconstructed. The 3D object depends upon knowledge of proper angular orientations assigned to the 2D projection images. Numerous algorithms have been developed for determining relative angular orientations between 2D images, but the transition from 2D to 3D remains challenging and can result in erroneous and conflicting results. Here we describe a general, automated procedure, called OptiMod, for reconstructing and optimizing 3D models using common-lines methodologies. OptiMod approximates orientation angles and reconstructs independent maps from 2D class averages. It then iterates the procedure, while considering each map as a raw solution that needs to be compared with other possible outcomes. We incorporate procedures for 3D alignment, clustering, and refinement to optimize each map, as well as standard scoring metrics to facilitate the selection of the optimal model. We also show that small angle tilt-pair data can be included as one of the scoring metrics to improve the selection of the optimal initial model, and also to provide a validation check. The overall approach is demonstrated using two experimental cryo-EM data sets--the 80S ribosome that represents a relatively straightforward case for ab initio reconstruction, and the Tf-TfR complex that represents a challenging case in that it has previously been shown to provide multiple equally plausible solutions to the initial model problem.",

        "Abstract": "Electron microscopy (EM) is an important tool for determining the composition, arrangement and structure of biological macromolecules. When studying structurally heterogeneous samples using EM, classification is a critical step toward achieving higher resolution and identifying biologically significant conformations. We have developed an interactive, web-based tool, called Maskiton, for creating custom masks and performing 2D classifications on aligned single-particle EM images. The Maskiton interface makes it considerably easier and faster to explore the significance of heterogeneity in single-particle datasets. Maskiton features include: resumable uploads to facilitate transfer of large datasets to the server, custom mask creation in the browser, continual progress updates, and interactive viewing of classification results. To demonstrate the value of this tool, we provide examples of its use on several experimental datasets and include analyses of the independent terminus mobility within the Ltn1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, the in vitro assembly of 30S ribosomal subunits, and classification complexity reduction within Immunoglobulin M. This work also serves as a proof-of-concept for the development of future cross-platform, interactive user interfaces for electron microscopy data processing.",

        "Abstract": "Single-particle electron microscopy (EM) is a powerful tool for studying the structures of large biological molecules. However, the achievable resolution does not always allow for direct recognition of individual protein domains. Labels that can be visualized by EM have been developed for protein termini, but tagging internal domains remains a challenge. We describe a robust strategy for determining the position of internal sites within EM maps, termed domain localization by RCT sampling (DOLORS). DOLORS uses monovalent streptavidin added posttranslationally to tagged sites in the target protein. Internal labels generally display less conformational flexibility than terminal labels, providing more precise positional information. Automated methods are used to rapidly generate assemblies of unique 3D models allowing the attachment sites of labeled domains to be accurately identified and thus provide an overall architectural map of the molecule.",

        "Abstract": "Influenza virus ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) are central to the viral life cycle and in adaptation to new host species. RNPs are composed of the viral genome, viral polymerase, and many copies of the viral nucleoprotein. In vitro cell expression of all RNP protein components with four of the eight influenza virus gene segments enabled structural determination of native influenza virus RNPs by means of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The cryo-EM structure reveals the architecture and organization of the native RNP, defining the attributes of its largely helical structure and how polymerase interacts with nucleoprotein and the viral genome. Observations of branched-RNP structures in negative-stain electron microscopy and their putative identification as replication intermediates suggest a mechanism for viral replication by a second polymerase on the RNP template.",

        "Title": "Spotiton: a prototype for an integrated inkjet dispense and vitrification system for cryo-TEM.",
        "Abstract": "Over the last three decades, Cryo-TEM has developed into a powerful technique for high-resolution imaging of biological macromolecules in their native vitrified state. However, the method for vitrifying specimens onto EM grids is essentially unchanged - application of ∼3 μL sample to a grid, followed by blotting and rapid plunge freezing into liquid ethane. Several trials are often required to obtain suitable thin (few hundred nanometers or less) vitrified layers amenable for cryo-TEM imaging, which results in waste of precious sample and resources. While commercially available instruments provide some level of automation to control the vitrification process in an effort to increase quality and reproducibility, obtaining satisfactory vitrified specimens remains a bottleneck in the Cryo-TEM pipeline. We describe here a completely novel method for EM specimen preparation based on small volume (picoliter to nanoliter) dispensing using inkjet technology. A first prototype system (Spotiton v0.5) demonstrates feasibility of this new approach for specimen vitrification. A piezo-electric inkjet dispenser is integrated with optical real-time cameras (100 Hz frame rate) to analyze picoliter to nanoliter droplet profiles in-flight and spreading dynamics on the grid, and thus provides a method to optimize timing of the process. Using TEM imaging and biochemical assays we demonstrate that the piezo-electric inkjet mechanism does not disrupt the structural or functional integrity of macromolecules. These preliminary studies provide insight into the factors and components that will need further development to enable a robust and repeatable technique for specimen vitrification using this novel approach.",

Images were acquired on a Tecnai F20 at 200keV and a nominal magnification of 29,000×. This camera has a significantly improved signal to noise ratio and modulation transfer function (MTF) at 200keV compared to a standard CCD camera installed on the same microscope. Control of the DDD has been integrated into Leginon, an automated data collection system. Using GroEL as a test specimen, we obtained images of ∼30K particles with the CCD and the DDD from the same specimen sample using essentially identical imaging conditions. Comparison of the maps reconstructed from the CCD images and the DDD images demonstrates the improved performance of the DDD. We also obtained a 3D reconstruction from ∼70K GroEL particles acquired using the DDD; the quality of the density map demonstrates the potential of this new recording device for cryoEM data acquisition.",

        "Abstract": "Here we evaluate a new grid substrate developed by ProtoChips Inc. (Raleigh, NC) for cryo-transmission electron microscopy. The new grids are fabricated from doped silicon carbide using processes adapted from the semiconductor industry. A major motivating purpose in the development of these grids was to increase the low-temperature conductivity of the substrate, a characteristic that is thought to affect the appearance of beam-induced movement (BIM) in transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of biological specimens. BIM degrades the quality of data and is especially severe when frozen biological specimens are tilted in the microscope. Our results show that this new substrate does indeed have a significant impact on reducing the appearance and severity of beam-induced movement in TEM images of tilted cryo-preserved samples. Furthermore, while we have not been able to ascertain the exact causes underlying the BIM phenomenon, we have evidence that the rigidity and flatness of these grids may play a major role in its reduction. This improvement in the reliability of imaging at tilt has a significant impact on using data collection methods such as random conical tilt or orthogonal tilt reconstruction with cryo-preserved samples. Reduction in BIM also has the potential for improving the resolution of three-dimensional cryo-reconstructions in general.",

There are a variety of strategies that deal with this issue, but not all of them are readily accessible and straightforward to use. We have developed a \"toolbox\" of ab initio reconstruction techniques that provide several options for calculating 3-D volumes in an easily managed and tightly controlled work-flow that adheres to standard conventions and formats. This toolbox is designed to streamline the reconstruction process by removing the necessity for bookkeeping, while facilitating transparent data transfer between different software packages. It currently includes procedures for calculating ab initio reconstructions via random or orthogonal tilt geometry, tomograms, and common lines, all of which have been tested using the 50S ribosomal subunit. Our goal is that the accessibility of multiple independent reconstruction algorithms via this toolbox will improve the ease with which models can be generated, and provide a means of evaluating the confidence and reliability of the final reconstructed map.",

        "Abstract": "Dicer is a specialized ribonuclease that initiates RNA interference (RNAi) by cleaving double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small RNA fragments about 22 nucleotides long. Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of human Dicer bound to the protein TRBP at approximately 20 A resolution determined by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) and single-particle analysis. Our analysis reveals that the Dicer-TRBP complex is an L-shaped molecule with a long edge of 150 A and a 100 A extension on one end. A surface trench runs the length of the long edge of the molecule, defining a putative dsRNA-binding site. Docking the crystal structure of Giardia Dicer, which represents the nuclease core of human Dicer, into the EM map suggests two possible overall molecular architectures for human Dicer. These results offer insights into the structure of Dicer proteins found in multicellular organisms and provide a conceptual framework for understanding the initiation of RNAi.",

        "Abstract": "It is becoming routine for cryoEM single particle reconstructions to result in 3D electron density maps with resolutions of approximately 10A, but maps with resolutions of 5A or better are still celebrated events. The electron microscope has a resolving power to better than 2A, and thus should not be a limiting factor; instead the practical limitations in resolution most likely arise from a combination of specimen preparation methods, data collection parameters, and data analysis procedures. With the aid of a highly automated system for acquiring images, coupled to a relational database to keep track of all processing parameters, we have taken a systematic approach to optimizing parameters affecting the resolution of single particle reconstructions. Using GroEL as a test-bed, we performed a series of 3D reconstructions where we systematically varied the number of particles used in computing the map, the accelerating voltage of the microscope, and the electron dose used to acquire the images. We also investigated methods for excluding unacceptable or \"bad\" particles from contributing to the final 3D map. Using relatively standard instrumentation (Tecnai F20, 4K x 4K CCD, side entry cold stage) and a completely automated approach, these approaches resulted in a map with a nominal resolution of 5.4A (FSC(0.5)) in which secondary structure is clearly discernable and the handedness of some of the alpha-helices in the GroEL structure can be determined.",

Methods compatible with fully automated screening have been developed for the process of crystal production by dialysis and for producing negatively stained grids of the resulting trials. Further automation via robotic handling of the EM grids, and semi-automated transmission electron microscopic imaging and evaluation of the trial grids is also possible. We, and others, have developed working prototypes for several of these tools and tested and evaluated them in a simple screen of 24 crystallization conditions. While further development of these tools is certainly required for a turn-key system, the goal of fully automated screening appears to be within reach.",

        "Abstract": "Two issues that often impact the cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) specimen preparation process are agglomeration of particles near hole edges in holey carbon films and variations in vitreous ice thickness. In many cases, the source of these issues was identified to be the residues and topography often seen in commercially available films. To study and minimize their impact during specimen preparation, an improved holey carbon film has been developed. Rather than using a consumable template based on soft materials that must be removed prior to grid assembly, a method was developed that uses a hard template and a water-soluble release layer to replicate the template pattern into the carbon films. The advantages of this method are the improved purity and flatness of the carbon films, and these attributes are shown to have a dramatic improvement on the distribution of single particles embedded in vitreous ice suspended across the holes. Improving particle distribution is an enabling factor toward increasing the throughput of data collection for cryoEM.",

In this article, we demonstrate the potential of the Leginon system for high-throughput data acquisition by describing an experiment in which we acquired images of more than 280,000 particles of GroEL in a single 25 h session at the microscope. We also demonstrate the potential for an automated pipeline for molecular microscopy by showing that these particles can be subjected to completely automated procedures to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3D) density map to a resolution better than 8 A. In generating the 3D maps, we used a variety of metadata associated with the data acquisition and processing steps to sort and select the particles. These metadata provide a number of insights into factors that affect the quality of the acquired images and the resulting reconstructions. In particular, we show that the resolution of the reconstructed 3D density maps improves with decreasing ice thickness. These data provide a basis for assessing the capabilities of high-throughput macromolecular microscopy.",

        "Abstract": "We present a completely automated algorithm for estimating the parameters of the contrast transfer function (CTF) of a transmission electron microscope. The primary contribution of this paper is the determination of the astigmatism prior to the estimation of the CTF parameters. The CTF parameter estimation is then reduced to a 1D problem using elliptical averaging. We have also implemented an automated method to calculate lower and upper cutoff frequencies to eliminate regions of the power spectrum which perturb the estimation of the CTF parameters. The algorithm comprises three optimization subproblems, two of which are proven to be convex. Results of the CTF estimation method are presented for images of carbon support films as well as for images of single particles embedded in ice and suspended over holes in the support film. A MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, called ACE, is freely available.",

The system, when integrated with automated data collection software, has the potential to carry out large scale multi-grid experiments, as required, for example, by 2D protein crystallization screening trials. We present a detailed description of the system that utilizes a 6 axis articulate robotic arm to load microscope grids into a specimen holder and then load the holder into the microscope. Grids are stored in trays with a capacity of 96 that are based on the format of a standard 96-well microtiter plate. The system has been integrated with an FEI Tecnai microscope and does not require any modification to the microscope and only minor modifications to the specimen holder. Preliminary results regarding cycle time, failure rates, positioning accuracy and a 96 grid screening experiment are presented.",

        "Abstract": "Manual selection of single particles in images acquired using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) will become a significant bottleneck when datasets of a hundred thousand or even a million particles are required for structure determination at near atomic resolution. Algorithm development of fully automated particle selection is thus an important research objective in the cryoEM field. A number of research groups are making promising new advances in this area. Evaluation of algorithms using a standard set of cryoEM images is an essential aspect of this algorithm development. With this goal in mind, a particle selection \"bakeoff\" was included in the program of the Multidisciplinary Workshop on Automatic Particle Selection for cryoEM. Twelve groups participated by submitting the results of testing their own algorithms on a common dataset. The dataset consisted of 82 defocus pairs of high-magnification micrographs, containing keyhole limpet hemocyanin particles, acquired using cryoEM. The results of the bakeoff are presented in this paper along with a summary of the discussion from the workshop. It was agreed that establishing benchmark particles and using bakeoffs to evaluate algorithms are useful in promoting algorithm development for fully automated particle selection, and that the infrastructure set up to support the bakeoff should be maintained and extended to include larger and more varied datasets, and more criteria for future evaluations.",

        "Abstract": "Although the methodology of molecular microscopy has enormous potential, it is time consuming and labor intensive. The techniques required to produce a three-dimensional (3D) electron density map of a macromolecular structure normally require manual operation of an electron microscope by a skilled operator and manual supervision of the sometimes complex software needed for analysis and calculation of 3D maps. Systems to automate the process of data acquisition from an electron microscope are being developing and these systems are being integrated with specimen handling operations and post acquisition data processing. Here, the current performance of our existing systems and the future challenges involved in substantially improving both the sustained throughput and the yield of automated data collection and analysis are reported.",

Investigation of fast, accurate approaches for automatic particle detection has become one of the current challenges in the cryoEM community. At the same time, the investigation is hampered by the fact that few benchmark particles or image datasets exist in the community. The unavailability of such data makes it difficult to evaluate newly developed algorithms and to leverage expertise from other disciplines. The paper presents our recent contribution to this effort. It also describes our newly developed computational framework for particle detection, through the application of edge detection and a sequence of ordered Hough transforms. Experimental results using keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as a model particle are very promising. In addition, it introduces a newly established web site, designed to support the investigation of automatic particle detection by providing an annotated image dataset of KLH available to the general scientific community.",
