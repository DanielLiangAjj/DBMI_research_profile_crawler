        "Abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is frequent in older adults and associated with left atrial (LA) dysfunction. LA strain (LAε) and LA strain rate (LASR) may detect subclinical LA disease. We investigated whether reduced LAε and LASR predict new-onset AF in older adults without history of AF or stroke. LAε and LASR were assessed by speckle-tracking echocardiography in 824 participants from the community-based Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study. Positive longitudinal LAε and LASR during ventricular systole, LASR during early ventricular diastole, and LASR during LA contraction were measured. Cause-specific hazards regression model evaluated the association of LAε and LASR with incident AF, adjusting for pertinent covariates. The mean age was 71.1 ± 9.2 years (313 men, 511 women). During a mean follow-up of 10.9 years, new-onset AF occurred in 105 participants (12.7%). Lower LAε and LASR at baseline were observed in patients with new-onset AF (all p <0.01). In multivariable analysis, positive longitudinal LAε (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per SD decrease 2.05, confidence interval [CI] 1.24 to 3.36) and LASR during LA contraction (HR per SD increase 2.24, CI 1.37 to 3.65) remained associated with new-onset AF, independently of LA volumes and left ventricular function. Along with positive longitudinal LAε, reduced LASR during ventricular systole predicted AF in participants with LA volume below the median value (HR 2.54, CI 1.10 to 6.09), whereas reduced LASR during LA contraction predicted AF in participants with larger LA (HR 2.35, CI 1.31 to 4.23). In conclusion, reduced positive longitudinal LAε and LASR predict new-onset AF in older adults regardless of LA size and may improve AF risk stratification.",

The relationship between subclinical LV dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias in the general population is not established. Methods and Results Participants in the SAFARIS (Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation and Risk of Ischemic Stroke) study with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (n=503; mean age 77 years, 63% women) underwent 14-day electrocardiographic monitoring and 2-dimensional echocardiography. Frequent PVCs were defined as PVCs >500 per 24 hours and NSVT as ≥4 consecutive ventricular ectopic beats. Reduced LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was used as an indicator of subclinical LV dysfunction. Seventy-six participants (15.1%) had PVCs >500/d, 117 (23.3%) had NSVT episodes. LV GLS was significantly reduced in both frequent PVCs and NSVT groups (",

        "Abstract": "To study the effect of exposure mixture on the continuous health outcomes, one can use the linear model with a weighted sum of multiple standardized exposure variables as an index predictor and its coefficient for the overall effect. The unknown weights typically range between zero and one, indicating contributions of individual exposures to the overall effect. Because the weight parameters present only when the parameter for overall effect is non-zero, testing hypotheses on the overall effect can be challenging, especially when the number of exposure variables is above two. This paper presents a working model based approach to estimate the parameter for overall effect and to test specific hypotheses, including two tests for detecting the overall effect and one test for detecting unequal weights when the overall effect is evident. The statistics are computationally easy and one can apply existing statistical software to perform the analysis. A simulation study shows that the proposed estimators for the parameters of interest may have better finite sample performance than some other estimators.",

        "Title": "Length of Stay and Health Care Utilization Among Pediatric Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Recipients.",
        "Abstract": "Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) has become a critical component in the treatment of pediatric malignancies, allowing for high-dose chemotherapy to be given safely and with greater efficacy in a subset of children at high risk for relapse. Risk factors associated with hospital length of stay (LOS) in adults undergoing autoHCT have been studied extensively; however, there is a paucity of studies describing risk factors associated with LOS and health care cost in children undergoing autoHCT. This study sought to identify factors influencing LOS and cost in pediatric autoHCT. We assessed LOS from autologous stem cell infusion from day 0 (D0) in 100 autoHCT admissions in 73 patients with malignant disease between 2007 and 2019. We evaluated demographic, pre-transplantation, post-transplantation, and socioeconomic variables to identify potential risk factors associated with LOS and cost. AutoHCT cost data were provided by the Pediatric Health Information System database. Indications for autoHCT included neuroblastoma (35.6%), brain tumor (27.4%), and relapsed lymphoma (24.7%). The median patient age was 4.88 years (range, 0.72 to 22 years), with 71% age <12 years, and the cohort was 63% male, 77% white, and 41% Hispanic. The median LOS from D0 was 19 days (range, 13 to 100 days). On multivariable analysis, age >12 years compared with 2 to 12 years (estimate, -8.9 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], -15.1 to -2.8; P = .004) and complete remission/very good partial response disease status (estimate, -5.0 days; 95% CI, -9.6 to -0.4 days; P = .031) were associated with a significantly decreased median LOS, whereas Hispanic ethnicity (estimate, +6.8 days; 95% CI, 1.1 to 12.6 days; P = .019), >5 days of fever (estimate, +7.3 days; 95% CI, 1.4 to 13.2 days; P = .015), and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) LOS (estimate, +14.9 days; 95% CI, 1.8 to 28.0 days; P = .025) were associated with a significant increase in median LOS. The median cost per transplantation admission was $96,850 (range, $39,833 to $587,321). Multivariable analysis showed that age >12 years (estimate, -$6,776; 95% CI, -$71,787 to -$11,402; P = .007) or <2 years (estimate, -$32,426; 95% CI, -$53,507 to -$11,345; P = .003), and complete remission/very good partial response disease status (estimate, -$20,266; 95% CI, -$40,211 to -$322; P = .046) were associated with significantly decreased median cost, whereas >5 days of fever (estimate, +$58,886; 95% CI, $30,667 to $87,105; P < .001) and PICU admission (estimate, +$102,458; 95% CI, $23,843 to $181,076; P = .011) were associated with significantly increased median cost. In summary, fever and PICU stay were found to be risk factors for increased LOS and cost. Age <12 years and Hispanic ethnicity were risk factors for increased LOS, whereas age <2 years and >12 years and female sex were associated with decreased cost. Further investigation to determine specific factors influencing LOS and cost is warranted to identify potentially modifiable risks within these patient populations.",

        "Abstract": "In active acromegaly, the lipolytic and insulin antagonistic effects of growth hormone (GH) excess alter adipose tissue (AT) deposition, reduce body fat, and increase insulin resistance. This pattern reverses with surgical therapy. Pegvisomant treats acromegaly by blocking GH receptor (GHR) signal transduction and lowering insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels. The long-term effects of GHR antagonist treatment of acromegaly on body composition have not been studied.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying which patients are at high risk for transplant-related mortality, prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), is crucial both to guide decision making with patients and families and to inform the alloHCT approach. There is a paucity of data evaluating the utility of the HCT comorbidity index (HCT-CI) in pediatric patients. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 188 patients who underwent alloHCT between January 2008 and October 2016 and assessed pretransplant comorbidities defined and weighted by the HCT-CI. The primary endpoint of our study was overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess survival estimates at 1-year post-transplant and did not differ based on HCT-CI scores: 78.7% (SE 6.69%) for HCT-CI = 0, 74.7% (SE 6.33%) for HCT-CI = 1 to 2, and 77.3% (SE 4.17%) for HCT-CI ≥3. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis did not show HCT-CI having an effect on OS: hazard ratio (HR) of 0.633 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.297 to 1.347) for HCT-CI scores 1 to 2 and HR of 0.935 (95% CI, 0.456 to 1.918) for HCT-CI scores ≥3 compared to scores of 0. The most frequent comorbidities observed were hepatic disease (mild in 29%, severe in 23%) and pulmonary disease (moderate in 15% and severe in 29%). However, only 55% were able to complete pulmonary function testing. Hepatic disease was based on transaminitis in 48% and by bilirubin alone in 26% of patients; 46% of patients with hepatic dysfunction had an underlying hemoglobinopathy and hyperbilirubinemia related to ongoing hemolysis. This study evaluates HCT-CI comorbidities in greater detail than has been performed previously in children undergoing alloHCT. We identify challenges with the HCT-CI in the pediatric population and highlight the comorbidities that may benefit from adjustments to their definition to create an improved risk assessment tool for children.",

        "Abstract": "Complications following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) continue to be a significant challenge that often result in significant morbidity/mortality and increased healthcare utilization and cost. In this study, we analyzed the impact of post-alloHCT complications on healthcare utilization and cost during first year post-transplant. We analyzed data on 240 pediatric patients. Complications analyzed included kidney injury, liver injury, lung injury, viral infections, bacterial infections, fungal infections, and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Patients were divided into three groups based on the number of complications (0-1, 2-3, and >3). Cost was estimated from charges recorded in the Pediatric Health Information System database and hospital accounting records. Patients with >3 complications had higher healthcare utilization and cost, primarily driven by inpatient hospitalization and intensive care unit admissions. Multivariable analysis of risk factors identified bacteremia ($90,166, SE = 26,636, p < 0.001), lung injury ($108,529, SE = 28,196, p < 0.001), liver injury ($90,805, SE = 28,660, p = 0.002), and grade II-IV aGVHD ($137,866, SE = 28,472, p < 0.001) as associated with significantly increased cost. Our study highlights the significant impact complications have on the overall cost of alloHCT. The identification that complications associated with high morbidity (aGVHD, pulmonary disease) are also associated with the highest financial burden emphasizes the need for future research in these areas to expand management options and improve outcomes for our patients.",

        "Abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has the capacity to cure numerous malignant and nonmalignant disorders. A dreaded complication is graft failure (GF), as it puts patients at high risk of infection and disease relapse. There are few contemporary data on the risks, outcomes, and economic burden of GF in pediatric patients. In this study, we address this gap by focusing on 14 years of transplant at our single center, for which data are compared in 2 time periods: 2005 to 2010 (n = 146) and 2011 to 2018 (n = 144). In the 290 patients studied, the median age was 9.33 years, and 50.3% had malignant versus nonmalignant disease. Cell source included bone marrow (51%), cord blood (19.7%), unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs; 12.1%), and CD34-selected PBSCs (17.2%). Twenty-one percent of patients had reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), and 54.8% of transplants were fully HLA matched. Most patients received serotherapy with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (39.3%) or alemtuzumab (42.8%). The incidence of neutropenic and non-neutropenic GF (NGF and NNGF) was 6.6% and 3.8%, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated alemtuzumab (odds ratio [OR], 6.256, P < .001) was the main variable associated with a higher rate of GF in both time periods, whereas RIC (OR, 11.8, P < .001) and cell source (CD34-selected PBSCs; OR, 4.22, P = .04) showed period-specific effects. Specifically, from time periods 1 to 2, cord blood transplants were discontinued at our center, with a concomitant increase in CD34-selected grafts and a shift from more episodes of NGF to NNGF. Overall survival was 69% in the entire HCT cohort and 50% among patients with GF. Survival among GF patients improved from time periods 1 to 2 (20% versus 80%, P = .001), potentially due to a higher incidence of NNGF and increased ability to perform stem cell boosts from the same donor once cord blood transplants were phased out. Inpatient length of stay was consistently higher for patients with GF. Similar trends were seen for inpatient costs, although improvements were seen in our entire HCT population over time. In summary, GF remains a significant challenge in pediatric HCT and poses an economic burden on the health care system.",

In this retrospective single center cohort study of 240 pediatric patients, we analyzed cost, healthcare utilization and patient outcomes for the first year post-alloHCT. Costs were estimated from charges recorded in the Pediatric Health Information System database and the hospital's accounting system. The overall incidence of grade I-IV aGVHD was 40.4%. The incidence of grade I, grade II, and grade III-IV aGVHD was 6.6%, 16.2%, and 17.5%, respectively. The overall incidence of steroid refractory (SR)-aGVHD was 10.8%. The median number of days of hospitalization in the first year post-alloHCT was significantly higher for patients with aGVHD vs. no aGVHD: 113 days (range: 35-354 days) vs. 63 days (range: 25-298 days), p < 0.001. Patients with SR-aGVHD had increased hospitalization compared with the patients with steroid responsive aGVHD (152.8 ± 66.6days vs. 111.3 ± 59.3 days, p = 0.004), with associated increased alloHCT cost of ~$200,000. On multivariable analysis of risk factor for alloHCT cost, aGVHD, was associated with significantly higher cost ($141,094 [SE = 31247], p < 0.001). In summary, aGVHD and SR-aGVHD is associated with prolonged hospitalization and higher cost and inferior survival among children. Better aGVHD prevention strategies are desperately needed.

        "Abstract": "The literature on the impact of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-related hospitalization in pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) recipients is limited. The aim of this study was to determine utilization and outcomes of CMV-related hospitalization in alloHCT recipients using a single-center clinical database. This was a retrospective study of 240 children aged 3 months to 21 years (median age, 9.5 years) who underwent alloHCT between 2005 and 2016. The impacts of CMV-related length of stay (LOS) and total healthcare costs were quantified. Factors associated with prolonged CMV viremia (>25 days' duration) were also examined. In at-risk patients with CMV infection, the incidence of CMV viremia was 38% (59 of 155), the median time to onset was 33 days (range, 0 to 292 days), and the median time to resolution was 25 days (range, 3 to 48 days; n = 53). CMV infection was associated with a 23.3-day increase in LOS (P = .004) and added hospital costs of $45,443 (P = .162) compared with patients without CMV infection. In multivariable analysis, receipt of alemtuzumab (P = .027) was associated with CMV viremia of >25 days' duration. Our data show that CMV viremia is associated with prolonged LOS and higher hospital costs and indicate the need for improved and cost-effective CMV prevention strategies. Further studies of patient outcomes and costs in pediatric alloHCT recipients is needed.",

        "Title": "Health care utilization and cost among pediatric patients receiving unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.",
        "Abstract": "The costs associated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) are high. Differences in costs and healthcare utilization among potential donor sources for alloHCT are not well characterized in pediatric recipients of alloHCT. One potential reason for these high costs could be the donor source of hematopoietic cells. In this retrospective study, inpatient costs, outpatient costs, and markers of healthcare utilization associated with unrelated donor alloHCT for malignant and non-malignant disease were analyzed for 131 pediatric patients during the first year post-transplant, for whom the donor sources were 38% umbilical cord blood (UCB), 14% unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC), 26% bone marrow (BM), and 22% PBSC with CD-34 selection. The median cost per day survived (through day +365) was lowest for patients receiving PBSC with CD-34 selection $926 (322-5316) as compared to UCB $1918 (491-107,93), unmanipulated PBSC $1516 (630-27,516), and BM $1205 (506-11,181) (p = 0.010). For non-malignant alloHCT, UCB had the highest costs per day survived $1530 (491-793) and PBSC with CD-34 selection had the lowest at $482 (322-3092) (p < 0.001). In a multivariable model for costs per day survived, high-risk disease (p = 0.009) and graft failure (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher cost and alloHCT between 2010 and 2015 as compared to 2005 and 2009 (p = 0.017) was significantly associated with lower cost per day survived. This study illustrates important differences in cost and healthcare utilization among the different donor sources used for unrelated alloHCT.",

        "Title": "Relationship between body mass and ambulatory blood pressure: comparison with office blood pressure measurement and effect of treatment.",
        "Abstract": "Epidemiologic studies assessing the relationship between blood pressure (BP), body mass, and cardiovascular events have primarily been based on office BP measurements, and few data are available in the elderly. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and BP values obtained by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) as compared to office BP measurements, and the effect of anti-hypertensive treatment on the relationship. The study population consisted of 813 subjects participating in the cardiovascular abnormalities and brain lesions (CABL) study who underwent 24-h ABPM. Office BP (mean of two measurements) was found to be associated with increasing BMI, for both SBP (p ≤ 0.05) and DBP (p ≤ 0.001). In contrast, there was no association seen of increasing BMI with ABPM parameters in the overall cohort, even after adjusting for age and gender. However, among subjects not on anti-hypertensive treatment, office SBP and DBP measurements were significantly correlated with increasing BMI (p ≤ 0.01) as were daytime SBP and 24-h SBP, although with a smaller spread across BMI subgroups compared with office readings. In treated hypertensives, there was only a trend toward increasing office DBP and increasing DBP variability with higher BMI. Our results suggest that body mass may have a less significant influence on BP values in the elderly when ABPM rather than office measurements are considered, particularly in patients receiving anti-hypertensive treatment.",

        "Title": "Timing and Utility of Relapse Surveillance after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Children with Leukemia.",
        "Abstract": "The utility and optimal timing of routine bone marrow (BM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surveillance after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in children with leukemia have not been previously studied. To examine the current practice concerning relapse surveillance in this population, we conducted a national survey of pediatric bone marrow transplant physicians. Sixty-two of 152 potential participants (41%) completed the survey. For acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, 41 physicians (66%) reported performing routine BM analysis in all such patients, 15 (24%) in some patients and 6 (10%) in no patients. Data were similar for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Among those who do such screening in the ALL population, 11 physicians (24%) reported performing 1 BM analysis in the first year, 11 (24%) performed 2, 6 (13%) performed 3, 12 (27%) performed 4, and 5 (12%) performed 5 to 10. Data were similar for AML. The most common time point for screening in both diseases was day 100, followed closely by day 365. With respect to central nervous system (CNS) screening in ALL, 11 physicians (18%) screened all patients, 28 (45%) screened no patients, and 23 (37%) screened only patients with prior CNS disease. Use of intrathecal chemotherapy in these patients also varied, with 7 (12%) doing so in all patients, 17 (29%) only in previously CNS-positive patients, and 35 (59%) in no patients. To assess the utility of surveillance procedures, we performed a retrospective review of 108 childhood leukemia patients after alloHCT at our center. Forty-one relapses (38%) occurred with a median time to relapse of 171 days. Five (12%) occurred after day 365. Of the 36 relapses within the first year, 20 (56%) were identified by clinical suspicion, whereas 16 (44%) were identified by routine screening procedures. The percentages of patients in whom routine screening detected relapse at days 100, 180, 270, and 365, respectively, was 6.7%, 11.1%, 11.9%, and 0%. That is, by day 365, no patient (of 38) who had routine BM surveillance had evidence of relapse on analysis of the BM. Our survey confirms a lack of standardization regarding routine BM and CSF relapse surveillance after alloHCT in children with leukemia. We have demonstrated that while day 365 post-alloHCT is a very commonly utilized time point for routine screening, the yield of such screening at this time is very low, such that the performance of these procedures may not be justified at that time. Prospective collaboration among pediatric alloHCT centers may help to provide more robust evidence-based guidelines designed to maximize utility and minimize risk.",

        "Abstract": "Infectious complications, particularly viral infections, remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Only a handful of studies in children have analyzed the risks for and impact of viremia on alloHCT-related outcomes. We conducted a retrospective study of 140 pediatric patients undergoing alloHCT to investigate the incidence of and risk factors for cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus (ADV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia and viral disease after alloHCT. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of viremia on days of hospitalization and develop an algorithm for routine monitoring of viremia. Patients were monitored before alloHCT and then weekly for 180 days after alloHCT. Patients were considered to have viremia if CMV were > 600 copies/mL, EBV were > 1000 copies/mL, or ADV were > 1000 copies/mL on 2 consecutive PCRs. The overall incidences of viremia and viral disease in all patients from day 0 to +180 after alloHCT were 41.4% (n = 58) and 17% (n = 24), respectively. The overall survival for patients with viremia and viral disease was significantly lower compared with those without viremia (58% versus 74.2%, P = .03) and viral disease (48.2% versus 71.2%, P = .024). We identified that pretransplantation CMV risk status, pre-alloHCT viremia, and use of alemtuzumab were associated with the risk of post-alloHCT viremia. The average hospitalization days in patients with CMV risk (P = .011), viremia (P = .024), and viral disease (P = .002) were significantly higher. The algorithm developed from our data can potentially reduce viral PCR testing by 50% and is being studied prospectively at our center. Improved preventative treatment strategies for children at risk of viremia after alloHCT are needed.",

        "Abstract": "In pediatric and adolescent patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, treatment-related toxicities remain a clinical challenge. A paucity of data investigates the risks for and survival impact of treatment-related toxicities in this population. Here the authors assess the relative toxicity of myeloablative, reduced-toxicity, and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens; identify patient-related predictors of post-transplant toxicities; and investigate the impact of early post-transplant toxicities on transplant-related mortality (TRM). In this retrospective study, 164 patients (aged 1 to 22 years) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation after busulfan-based conditioning for malignant and nonmalignant diseases between 2000 and 2014. The number of grades III to IV toxicities between days 0 and +30 was calculated for each patient. TRM was calculated to 2 years. Median patient age was 9 years, and median number of toxicities was 3 (range, 0 to 17). The 100-person day incidence of post-transplant toxicities in myeloablative conditioning was not different from the incidence in reduced-toxicity conditioning (13.88 versus 13.59, P = .812). Reduced intensity was less toxic than both myeloablative and reduced toxicity (13.75 versus 8.41, P < .001). Age ≥ 12 years (.276 with SE = .138, P = .045) and unrelated donor transplant (.318 with SE = 0.113, P = .005) were risk factors for ≥3 toxicities. Having ≥3 toxicities or a performance score < 90 conferred higher risk of TRM (P = .021). In pediatric and adolescent patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation, reduced-toxicity conditioning was not significantly less toxic than myeloablative conditioning. Additionally, the number of post-transplant toxicities correlated with the risk of mortality. Further investigations to confirm our findings are warranted.",

        "Abstract": "Tacrolimus (FK506) is a calcineurin inhibitor and is an essential component of many immunosuppressive regimens. The oral bioavailability of tacrolimus may be affected by many factors, including patient age and gender, as well as by drug-drug interactions or genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolism. The dosing recommendations for pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) recipients have been derived from tacrolimus use in adult solid-organ transplantation patients. Data describing the impact of conversion of i.v. tacrolimus to oral on the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) are limited in children after alloHCT. In this study, we describe the incidence of grades II to IV aGVHD after conversion from i.v. tacrolimus to oral tacrolimus and study the clinical factors associated with delayed achievement of therapeutic blood levels. In this retrospective analysis, 68 pediatric patients (median age, 6.7 years; range, .25 to 22 years), underwent alloHCT for malignant and nonmalignant diseases and received tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for aGVHD prophylaxis. Among all patients, the median number of days to achieve therapeutic tacrolimus trough concentration (10 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) was 7 days (range, 0 to 37 days). Twenty-two patients developed grades II to IV aGVHD and the cumulative incidence of grades II to IV aGVHD in all patients was 32.4% (standard error, .06). On multivariate analysis ethnicity (white versus others: odds ratio [OR], -4.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.091 to 18.91; P = .038) and ≥ 10 days of subtherapeutic tacrolimus levels in first 30 days on i.v. (OR, -3.8; 95% CI, 1.276 to 11.43; P = .017) were significantly associated with delay in achieving therapeutic tacrolimus trough concentration. The impact of race/ethnicity on therapeutic tacrolimus trough concentration in pediatric alloHCT recipients should be further studied prospectively so that individualized dosing plans can be developed.",

        "Abstract": "Planned and unplanned subgroup analyses of large clinical trials are frequently performed and the results are sometimes difficult to interpret. The source of a nominal significant finding may come from a true signal, variation of the clinical trial outcome or the observed data structure. Quantitative assessment is critical to the interpretation of the totality of the clinical data. In this article we provide a general framework to manage subgroup analyses and to interpret the findings through a set of supplement analyses to planned main (primary and secondary) analyses, as an alternative to the commonly used multiple comparison framework. The proposed approach collectively and coherently utilizes several quantitative methods and enhances the credibility and interpretability of subgroup analyses. A case study is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method.",

        "Abstract": "HHV-6 is an evolving pathogen in the field of AlloHCT. However, the impact of HHV-6 on AlloHCT outcomes remains to be elucidated. We studied the incidence and clinical impact of HHV-6 viremia in children following AlloHCT. One hundred consecutive children were monitored weekly by plasma PCR for the first 180 days following AlloHCT for HHV-6, CMV, EBV, and ADV. HHV-6 viremia was defined as plasma PCR >1000 viral copies/mL. The median age was nine yr. Following AlloHCT, 19% (95% CI 11.3-26.7%) of patients had HHV-6 viremia, with the highest incidence of reactivation (14/19, 73%) occurring during day +15-day +98. The proportion of platelet engraftment by day +180 was lower in patients with HHV-6 viremia (58%) than in those without HHV-6 viremia (82%), p = 0.028. Delay in neutrophil and platelet engraftment was not associated with HHV-6 viremia in multivariate analysis. Similarly, HHV-6 viremia was not associated with TRM in multivariate analysis (p = 0.15). In summary, HHV-6 viremia is prevalent in pediatric AlloHCT recipients. Based on our study results, we recommend that HHV-6 PCR should only be performed on clinical suspicion.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past 20years, the field of pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation has made ground-breaking strides in the successful treatment of patients with both malignant and non-malignant diseases. As the field advances, so does the need for high-quality studies including randomized controlled trials, aimed at answering clinically important questions about optimizing care and outcomes of children undergoing alloHCT. In an effort to actively address emerging clinical questions, three main cooperative groups in the U.S. have joined forces to develop and implement multiple clinical trials for pediatric alloHCT patients. These groups include the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network, the Children's Oncology Group and the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium. Though the field of stem cell transplantation continues to advance, conducting clinical trials in the pediatric population is a unique challenge and as a result, optimal outcomes have yet to be reached in this population. Because of the limited number of pediatric transplant patients at each institution in the U.S., trials aimed at answering important clinical questions still struggle to accrue acceptable numbers of patients in an appropriate amount of time and thus gathering statistically useful data has posed a challenge for the field. In an effort to mitigate some of the challenges associated with obtaining statistically and clinically meaningful information about pediatric alloHCT, the implementation of new cooperative group trials is active and ongoing.",

We show that the NPMLE is asymptotically normal and achieves asymptotic nonparametric efficiency. We also provide a uniformly consistent estimator of the corresponding asymptotic covariance function based on an information operator. The finite-sample performance of the proposed NPMLE is examined with simulation studies, which show that the NPMLE has smaller mean squared error than the existing estimators and its corresponding pointwise confidence intervals have reasonable coverages. A real example is also presented.",

        "Abstract": "Limited data exist regarding health care utilization (HCU) in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for sickle cell disease. Financial data from 2002 to 2011 were analyzed for 26 alloHCT patients and 48 control subjects (referred but without alloHCT). HCU of alloHCT was determined over 3 time periods: pre-alloHCT, during alloHCT (day 0 to day +365), and post-alloHCT. The median total cost per patient during the alloHCT year was $413,000 inpatient and $18,000 outpatient. Post-alloHCT HCU decreased when compared with pre-alloHCT and control subjects. The median cost of post-alloHCT outpatient visits per patient was significantly less when compared with pre-alloHCT (P = .044). The median cost of post-alloHCT inpatient visits per patient approached significance when compared with those pre-alloHCT (P = .079). Sixteen post-alloHCT patients, 19 control subjects, and 14 unaffected siblings were surveyed using Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and EuroQOL questionnaires; however, the questionnaire scores across all 3 patient groups were not statistically significant (P = .2638). When adjusted for health-related quality of life, the analysis suggested alloHCT has a positive impact on health-related quality of life over control subjects. These pilot data support our hypothesis that alloHCT in children with sickle cell disease reduces HCU compared with control subjects without alloHCT.",

        "Abstract": "Only a few studies in children have evaluated the efficacy of prophylactic regimens using tacrolimus on acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). As a result, optimal tacrolimus levels in children after matched sibling donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) are not well defined. We measured the association between subtherapeutic levels (<10 ng/mL) during weeks 1 to 4 after alloHCT and the cumulative incidence of grades II to IV aGVHD in children. Additionally, we identified optimal lower cutoff levels for tacrolimus. Sixty patients (median age, 8 years) received tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil between March 2003 and September 2012. Twenty-three had a malignant disease and 37 nonmalignant disorders. The stem cell source included peripheral blood stem cells (n = 12) and bone marrow or cord blood (n = 48). Conditioning regimen varied. Specifically, 38.3% received a myeloablative regimen, 36.7% receiving a reduced-toxicity regimen, and 25% receiving a reduced-intensity regimen. Tacrolimus was initiated at .03 mg/kg/day via continuous i.v. infusion or .12 mg/kg/day orally. The dose was adjusted to maintain daily steady state concentrations within a range of 10 to 20 ng/mL. The overall incidence of grades II to IV aGVHD was 33.3%. On multivariate analysis, a mean tacrolimus level < 10 ng/mL during week 3 (P = .042; 95% confidence interval, 1.051 to 14.28) was significantly associated with increased incidence of grades II to IV aGVHD. Using weekly receiver operator curves, the optimal lower cutoff for tacrolimus levels was 10 to 11.2 ng/mL. Further prospective studies are warranted to study the incidence of aGVHD comparing the conventional tacrolimus levels of 5 to 15 versus 10 to 15 ng/mL.",

        "Abstract": "In biomedical research and practice, continuous biomarkers are often used for diagnosis and prognosis, with a cut-point being established on the measurement to aid binary classification. When survival time is examined for the purposes of disease prognostication and is found to be related to the baseline measure of a biomarker, employing a single cut-point on the biomarker may not be very informative. Using survival time-dependent sensitivity and specificity, we extend a concordance probability-based objective function to select survival time-related cut-points. To estimate the objective function with censored survival data, we adopt a non-parametric procedure for time-dependent receiver operational characteristics curves, which uses nearest neighbor estimation techniques. In a simulation study, the proposed method, when used to select a cut-point to optimally predict survival at a given time within a specified range, yields satisfactory results. We apply the procedure to estimate survival time-dependent cut-point on the prognostic biomarker of serum bilirubin among patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.",

        "Abstract": "Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) portends increased morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. In those with advanced heart failure, heart transplantation (HT) is the only causative therapy to increase survival. However, little is known about the impact of symptomatic PVD on survival of HT recipients in large multicenter cohorts. The aim of this study was to investigate an association between recipient symptomatic PVD and survival after HT. We analyzed 20,297 patients from the United Network of Organ Sharing data set. Survival analysis using a control cohort established by propensity matching was performed. There was an increased prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in 711 patients with symptomatic PVD compared with 19,586 patients without PVD. Patients with pretransplant symptomatic PVD had increased post-transplant mortality compared with those without PVD (1-, 5- and 10-year survival rate 91.5% vs 94.9%, 74.8% vs 82.6%, 48.6% vs 54.7%, respectively, log-rank p<0.001). On multivariate analysis based on the propensity matching, factors associated with a lower survival rate were presence of PVD (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidential interval 1.02 to 1.42, p=0.030), and female gender (hazard ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.47, p=0.034). In conclusion, patients with symptomatic PVD have a lower survival rate after HT. Symptomatic PVD should be considered an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in patients undergoing HT evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "An important issue in statistical inference for semiparametric models is how to provide reliable and consistent variance estimation. Brown and Wang (2005. Standard errors and covariance matrices for smoothed rank estimators. Biometrika 92: , 732-746) proposed a variance estimation procedure based on an induced smoothing for non-smooth estimating functions. Herein a Monte Carlo version is developed that does not require any explicit form for the estimating function itself, as long as numerical evaluation can be carried out. A general convergence theory is established, showing that any one-step iteration leads to a consistent variance estimator and continuation of the iterations converges at an exponential rate. The method is demonstrated through the Buckley-James estimator and the weighted log-rank estimators for censored linear regression, and rank estimation for multiple event times data.",

        "Abstract": "Although heavy alcohol consumption is associated with hypertension, the impact of lighter consumption on blood pressure (BP) is controversial. The protective effect of light alcohol consumption on cardiovascular disease described in previous studies could be, in part, mediated by effects of alcohol on BP. However, only a few studies investigating the association between alcohol and BP included elderly subjects, despite their higher risk of hypertension sequelae. Accordingly, we evaluated the relationship between alcohol consumption and 24-hour ambulatory BP in a community-based elderly cohort.",

        "Title": "Relation between long sleep and left ventricular mass (from a multiethnic elderly cohort).",
        "Abstract": "Short-sleep and long-sleep duration are associated with prevalent hypertension, poor cardiovascular health, and mortality. The relation of sleep hours with increased left ventricular (LV) mass, a strong correlate of elevated blood pressure (BP) values, is not established. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis among the participants of the population-based Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study. LV mass was estimated by transthoracic echocardiography. Sleep duration was assessed by reported hours of sleep on a diary kept during 24-hour BP monitoring. Multivariate linear regression models were constructed to assess the relation between sleep hours and LV mass index (LV mass divided by body surface area). Analysis of sleep hour categories (short and long sleep) was performed. Among 756 participants (mean age 71 ± 9 years, 60% women, and 71% Hispanics), the mean sleep duration was 8.6 ± 1.8 hours, and LV mass index was 103 ± 26 g/m². A J-shaped relation between sleep hours squared and LV mass index was observed adjusting for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors. Categorical analysis showed an association between long-sleep duration (>11 hours) and LV mass index (β = 7.4; p = 0.013). Long sleepers had higher diurnal systolic BP (p = 0.012) and nocturnal systolic BP (p <0.001) compared with the reference group. A great part of the variance between sleep duration and LV mass was explained by 24-hour systolic BP (β = 0.45; p <0.0001). In conclusion, self-reported long-sleep duration was associated with increased LV mass. Higher systolic BP, especially nocturnal, may account for part of the observed association.",

        "Title": "Risk factors associated with liver injury and impact of liver injury on transplantation-related mortality in pediatric recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",
        "Abstract": "In adults, hepatic complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are associated with significant morbidity and transplantation-related mortality (TRM). However, there is a paucity of parallel data on the incidence of, and risk factors for, liver injury (LI) and the impact of LI on TRM in pediatric allo-HSCT recipients. We compared total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alanine aminotransferase values before allo-HSCT and at 1 month, day +100, and 12 months after allo-HSCT in 248 patients who received either a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen (n = 109) or a reduced-toxicity/reduced-intensity conditioning (RTC/RIC) regimen (n = 139). LI was defined as grade ≥ 2 hyperbilirubinemia according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 3.0/4.0 (total bilirubin, >1.95 mg/dL, 1.5 times above the upper limit of normal for our laboratory). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for LI and TRM. The incidence of LI at 1 month after allo-HSCT was 14.1%. The median bilirubin level was 3.5 mg/dL (range, 1.97 to 32.2 mg/dL). Only LI as defined by total bilirubin level, but not by direct bilirubin or alanine aminotransferase level, was found to be a significant predictor for TRM. The 1-year TRM was 60.7% (95% confidence interval, 42.6% to 78.7%) in patients with LI at 1 month after allo-HSCT, compared with 14.6% (95% confidence interval, 9.9% to 19.4%) (P < .0001) in patients those who did not have liver injury. Multivariate analysis identified age (P = .03), total body irradiation (P = .007), bacterial bloodstream infection (BBSI) (P = .001), and invasive fungal infection (IFI) (P = .002) as significant risk factors for developing LI at 1 month. On multivariate analysis for risk factors for TRM, only LI at 1 month after allo-HSCT (P < .0001), primary graft failure (P = .001), BBSI (P = .003), and systemic viral infection (P = .04) were identified as significant risk factors for TRM. LI before allo-HSCT conditioning was not associated with higher TRM. Although the incidence of LI in pediatric allo-HSCT recipients is low, LI is associated with very high TRM. BBSI and IFI are the primary risk factors for LI.",

        "Abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) with myeloablative conditioning is associated with a 10%-40% risk of day +100 transplantation-related mortality (TRM). We evaluated the feasibility and safety of reduced-toxicity conditioning and allo-HSCT in 100 consecutive children and adolescent recipients (mean age, 9.2 ± 6.8 years). The mean duration of follow-up was 1278 ± 1042 days. Fifty patients had malignant disease. The median time to neutrophil recovery was 18 days, and the median time to platelet recovery was 43 days. Median donor chimerism in engrafted patients was 98% on day +100 and 98% on day +365. The cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.1%-27.9%), and that of chronic GVHD was 13.5% (95% CI, 6.6%-20.4%). TRM was 3% (95% CI, 0%-6.4%) by day +100 and 13.6% (95% CI, 6.7%-20.5%) for the entire study period. The incidence of primary graft failure (PGF) was 16% overall, 31.4% after umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT), and 0% after allo-HSCT with matched unrelated or matched sibling donors (P < .0001). The incidence of PGF in UCBT recipients was 46.7% (14 of 30) in chemotherapy-naive recipients, versus 9.5% (2 of 21) in non-chemotherapy-naive recipients (P = .019). Five-year event-free survival was 59.5% ± 5%, and 5-year overall survival was 72.9% ± 5%. Only PGF and poor-risk disease status were significantly associated with decreased overall survival (P = .03). Reduced-toxicity conditioning allo-HSCT in pediatric recipients is associated with low TRM; however, chemotherapy-naive UCBT recipients have a significantly higher incidence of PGF.",

        "Title": "Higher ambulatory blood pressure is associated with aortic valve calcification in the elderly: a population-based study.",
        "Abstract": "Aortic valve calcification (AVC) without outflow obstruction (stenosis) is common in the elderly and increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although high blood pressure (BP) measured at the doctor's office is known to be associated with AVC, little is known about the association between 24-hour ambulatory BP (ABP) and AVC. Our objective was to clarify the association between ABP variables and AVC. The study population consisted of 737 patients (mean age, 71±9 years) participating in the Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study who underwent 24-hour ABP monitoring. Each aortic valve leaflet was graded on a scale of 0 (normal) to 3 (severe calcification). A total valve score (values 0-9) was calculated as the sum of all leaflet scores. Advanced AVC (score ≥4) was present in 77 subjects (10.4%). All of the systolic ABP variables (except systolic BP nocturnal decline) and mean asleep diastolic BP were positively associated with advanced calcification, whereas normal dipping status and diastolic BP nocturnal decline were negatively associated. Multiple regression analysis indicated that mean awake diastolic BP (odds ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.01-1.71]) and asleep diastolic BP (odds ratio, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.04-1.72]) remained independently associated with advanced calcification after adjustment for age, sex, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, serum creatinine, and any degree of aortic insufficiency. Diastolic ABP is independently associated with advanced calcification. This finding may have important implications in gaining further insight into the mechanism of AVC.",

        "Abstract": "This paper uses a non-parametric test, based on consistently estimated discrimination accuracy defined as concordance probability between quantitative predictor and outcome, to compare paired biomarkers in predicting a health outcome, possibly subject to random censoring. Comparing with the Wilcoxon test for paired predictors based on Harrell's C-index, we found that the proposed test is better in presence of random censoring, although the two unbiased tests are equivalent for outcome either uncensored or censored by a constant. A simulation study also demonstrates that the bias in estimated difference in concordance probability, due to ignoring random censoring, results in overestimated power, especially when random censoring is heavy. The method was applied in two studies, where the biomarkers measured from the same study subjects are correlated. The first study on 299 school children in Bangladesh found the associations that higher blood arsenic and manganese were related to lower intellectual test scores, while the differences between the biomarkers in predicting the intellectual test scores were not statistically significant. The second study on 418 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis found that the baseline serum bilirubin had greater discrimination accuracy than the baseline serum albumin in predicting survival time.",

        "Abstract": "Increased arterial stiffness and wave reflection have been reported in heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) and in asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, a precursor of HFNEF. It is unclear whether women, who have higher frequency of HFNEF, are more vulnerable than men to the deleterious effects of arterial stiffness on LV diastolic function. We investigated, in a large community-based cohort, whether sex differences exist in the relationship among arterial stiffness, wave reflection, and LV diastolic function. Arterial stiffness and wave reflection were assessed in 983 participants from the Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study using applanation tonometry. The central pulse pressure/stroke volume index, total arterial compliance, pulse pressure amplification, and augmentation index were used as parameters of arterial stiffness and wave reflection. LV diastolic function was evaluated by 2-dimensional echocardiography and tissue-Doppler imaging. Arterial stiffness and wave reflection were greater in women compared with men, independent of body size and heart rate (all P<0.01), and showed inverse relationships with parameters of diastolic function in both sexes. Further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors attenuated these relationships; however, a higher central pulse pressure/stroke volume index predicted LV diastolic dysfunction in women (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence intervals, 1.03 to 2.30) and men (odds ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.39), independent of other risk factors. In conclusion, in our community-based cohort study, higher arterial stiffness was associated with worse LV diastolic function in men and women. Women's higher arterial stiffness, independent of body size, may contribute to their greater susceptibility to develop HFNEF.",

        "Abstract": "Atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic arch is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke. Although high blood pressure (BP) measured at the doctor's office is known to be associated with aortic atherosclerosis, little is known on the association between 24-h ambulatory BP and aortic arch plaque presence and severity. Our objective was to clarify the association between ambulatory BP variables and aortic arch atherosclerosis in a community-based cohort.",

        "Abstract": "Adenovirus infection is a significant complication in paediatric AlloSCT recipients with a mortality rate for disseminated adenovirus that may exceed 80%. We sought to determine the incidence, risk factors, and associated outcomes of adenovirus infection in 123 consecutive paediatric AlloSCT recipients. Adenovirus was diagnosed by antigen detection or viral culture, and was defined by isolation of virus with presence of correlating clinical symptoms. The probability of developing adenovirus infection was 12.3% (CI(95) 6.0-18.6). There were no statistically significant differences in probability of adenovirus infection in univariate analysis of risk factors including donor source, use of ATG/Alemtuzumab, ≥ Grade II GVHD, among others (age, diagnosis, conditioning regimen). Probability of overall survival for patients that experienced adenovirus infection was 15.4% vs. 50% for those without adenovirus (P = 0.0286). In multivariate analysis, the most important risk factor for an increased risk of death was adenovirus infection [HR 3.15 (CI(95) 1.6-6.18) P = 0.0009]. In this series of paediatric AlloSCT recipients, the development of adenovirus infection was the leading multivariate predictor of treatment-related mortality. Enhanced surveillance with adenovirus PCR and identification of the risk factors associated with poor outcomes from adenovirus infection may identify patients that may benefit from pre-emptive therapeutic interventions including adenovirus-specific cellular immunotherapies.",

        "Abstract": "High salt intake may affect left ventricular mass (LVM). We hypothesized that urinary sodium (UNa) and sodium/potassium ratio (UNa/K) are associated with LVM in a predominantly normotensive cohort of young adults. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study is a multicenter cohort of black and white men and women aged 30±3.6 years at the time of baseline echocardiographic examination (1990-1991). 2D guided M-mode LVM indexed to body size (grams per meter(2.7)) was calculated, and UNa and potassium excretion assessed (average of three 24-hour urinary samples, n=1042). Linear and logistic regression analysis was used. Participants were 57% women and 55% black. Only 4% were hypertensive. UNa, urinary potassium, and UNa/K ratios were (mean±SD) 175.6±131.0, 56.4±46.3, and 3.4±1.4 mmol/24 h, respectively. Participants in the highest versus the lowest UNa excretion quartile had the greatest LVM (37.5 versus 34.0 g/m(2.7); P<0.001). Adjusted for age, sex, education, and race, LVM averaged 0.945 g/m(2.7) higher per SD of UNa/K (P=0.001). The relationship between UNa/K and LVM persisted among 399 participants with repeat echocardiographic measures 5 years later. In logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, education, and race, each SD higher baseline UNa/K was associated with 23% and 38% greater chances of being in the highest quartile of LVM at baseline (odds ratio: 1.23; P=0.005) and 5 years later (odds ratio: 1.38; P=0.02). A higher sodium/potassium excretion ratio is significantly related to cardiac structure, even among healthy young adults.",

        "Abstract": "Pediatric allogeneic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) patients are at substantial risk of developing kidney injury (KI), and KI contributes to transplant-related morbidity and mortality. We compared the estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-AlloSCT in 170 patients following reduced toxicity conditioning (RTC) versus myeloablative conditioning (MAC) to baseline. eCrCl was calculated using the Schwartz equation. Patients with ≥ 50% drop in eCrCl from the baseline were considered to have KI. Patients received tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. The logistic regression model was used for assessing risk factors for KI. Seventy-six patients (median age = 10.6 years) received RTC AlloSCT; 94 patients (median age = 8.5 years) received MAC AlloSCT. The incidence of KI at 1 month post-AlloSCT was significantly higher in MAC versus RTC AlloSCT (43/94 [45.7%] versus 13/76 [17.1%] P < .0001). There was no statistical difference in KI at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-AlloSCT between the 2 conditioning groups. On multivariate analysis, only MAC was a significant risk factor for KI (odds radio [OR] 3.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-7.42, P = .002). In multivariate analysis for risk factors affecting overall survival (OS), the following were statistically significant: MAC versus RTC (hazard ratio [HR] 2.66, P = .0008), average versus poor-risk disease status (HR 2.09, P = .004), matched sibling donor (MSD) and matched unrelated donor (MUD) versus umbilical cord blood (UCB) (HR 2.31, P = .013), no KI versus KI (HR 2.00, P = .005). In children, MAC is associated with significant risk of KI in the first month after transplant, and KI in the first month post-AlloSCT is associated with a significantly decreased OS.",

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease and stroke. The association between CIMT and aortic arch plaques has been studied in patients with strokes, but not in the general population. The aim of this study was to investigate this association in an elderly asymptomatic cohort and to assess the possibility of using CIMT to predict the presence or absence of large aortic arch plaques.",

        "Title": "An age-dependent pharmacokinetic study of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in combination with tacrolimus for GVHD prophylaxis in pediatric allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients.",
        "Abstract": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) still remains a major limiting factor following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) in pediatric recipients. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an uncompetitive selective inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, is a new immunosuppressant agent without major mucosal, hepatic, or renal toxicity compared to other prophylactic aGVHD immunosuppressant drugs. Although there has been an extensive pharmacokinetic (PK) experience with MMF administration following solid organ transplantation in children, there is a paucity of PK data following its use in pediatric AlloSCT recipients. We investigated the safety and PK of MMF as GVHD prophylaxis following intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) administration (900 mg/m(2) every 6 hours) in conjunction with tacrolimus, after myeloablative (MA) and nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning and AlloSCT in 3 distinct age groups of pediatric AlloSCT recipients (0-6 years, 6-12 years, and 12-16 years). Mycophenolic acid (MPA) in plasma samples was measured either by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) as we have previously described. Plasma samples were obtained at baseline and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after i.v. dosing on days +1, +7, +14, and at 2 time points between day +45 and +100 after p.o. administration post AlloSCT. MPA PK analysis included AUC (0-6 hours), C(max), T(max), C(ss), V(ss), C trough (C(0)), CL, and T((1/2).) Thirty-eight patients, with a median age of 8 years (0.33-16 years), 20/18 M:F ratio, 21/17 malignant/nonmalignant disease, 17/21 MA: NMA conditioning, 16 of 22 related/unrelated allografts. Median time to myeloid and platelet engraftment was 18 and 31 days, respectively. Mean donor chimerism on day +60 and +100 was 83% and 90%, respectively. Probability of developing aGVHD grade II-IV and extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 54% and 34%, respectively. There was significant intra- and interpatient MMF PK variability. There was a significant increase in i.v. MPA area under the curve (AUC)(0-6 hour) and C(max) (P < .0003) and a significant decrease in CL(ss) (P < .002) and V(ss) (P < .001) on day +14 versus day +7. Children <12 years of age had a significant increase in i.v. MPA T(max) (P = .01), V(ss) (P = .028), and CL(ss) (P < .001) compared to the older age group. There was a trend in increased i.v. MPA CL(ss) following MA versus NMA conditioning (P < .054); i.v. and p.o. MMF administration (900 mg/m(2) every 6 hours) in combination with tacrolimus was well tolerated in pediatric AlloSCT recipients. There was a significant increase in MPA exposure on day +14 versus day +7, suggesting improved enterohepatic recirculation at day +14 post-AlloSCT. Children <12 years of age appear to have a significantly different MPA PK profile compared to older children and adolescents and may require more frequent dosing.",

        "Abstract": "It is still controversial whether type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with increased left ventricular (LV) mass independent of body size. We tested the hypothesis that T2DM is independently associated with LV mass in a multiethnic cohort. In the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) cohort sample, a total of 1,932 subjects (67.9+/-9.6 years, 769 men and 1,163 women, 443 with DM and 1,489 without DM) were studied by transthoracic echocardiography, and LV mass was calculated. LV hypertrophy was defined as the upper quartile of LV mass. Multivariable models were used to assess the association of T2DM with LV mass after adjusting for age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, education, history of coronary artery disease, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. LV mass (189+/-60 vs 174+/-59 g, p<0.0001), BMI, and systolic blood pressure were higher in the DM group than in the non-DM group, whereas age and gender distributions were similar between groups. In multivariable analysis, T2DM was independently associated with increased LV mass (p=0.03). Presence of T2DM was associated with increased risk of LV hypertrophy (adjusted odds ratio 1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.88, p=0.004). Although no interactions were observed between T2DM and BMI on LV hypertrophy (p=0.6), there was a significant interaction between T2DM and waist circumference on LV hypertrophy (p=0.01). In conclusion, T2DM was independently associated with increased LV hypertrophy independent of various covariates in this multiethnic sample. Presence of T2DM increased the risk of LV hypertrophy by about 1.5-fold, and it possibly interacted with central obesity.",

        "Abstract": "It is still controversial whether fasting blood glucose (FBG) is associated with the risk of vascular outcomes among nondiabetic subjects. We sought to determine whether FBG is associated with vascular outcomes and whether this association differs among various racial or ethnic groups. In the Northern Manhattan Study, a total of 2,372 subjects (mean age 68.8 +/- 10.7 years, 36% men) without a history of diabetes mellitus, stroke, or myocardial infarction (MI) were followed for an average of 7.5 years for ischemic stroke, MI, and combined vascular events defined as either ischemic stroke, MI, or vascular death. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of FBG-associated risk for vascular outcomes after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, hypertension, current smoking, previous coronary artery disease, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alcohol intake, and physical activity. The incidences of MI, ischemic stroke, and combined vascular events were 5.5, 6.3, and 20.0 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Each SD increase of FBG (27 mg/dl) was associated with statistically significantly increased risks of combined vascular events (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.31) and MI (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.44), but the effect was weaker, evident for ischemic stroke (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.34). FBG was significantly associated with incident ischemic stroke among African-American subjects (hazard ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.74) and incident MI among Hispanic subjects (hazard ratio 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.55). In conclusion, FBG was an independent predictor for vascular outcomes among individuals without history of diabetes from this multiethnic cohort. The effects were more apparent for MI than for ischemic stroke; however, FBG was a strong predictor of ischemic stroke among African-American subjects.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a non-parametric approach for the selection of items in a scale for screening, with the score defined as the sum of item response indicators. Without specifying parametric models for binary classification probabilities, the proposed item selection method evaluates the change in classification accuracy due to adding or deleting one item for a scale with k items. It first removes least useful items from the scale and then uses a forward stepwise selection procedure to the remaining items to identify a subset of items for a reduced scale. The reduced scale usually retains or improves classification accuracy compared to the full scale. The variation in items selected can be assessed with bootstrap samples. In a simulation study, the proposed procedure shows a fairly good finite sample performance. The method is illustrated with a data set on patients with and without high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease who were administered a 40-item test of olfactory function.",

        "Abstract": "Longitudinal health-related quality of life data arise naturally from studies of progressive and neurodegenerative diseases. In such studies, patients' mental and physical conditions are measured over their follow-up periods and the resulting data are often complicated by subject-specific measurement times and possible terminal events associated with outcome variables. Motivated by the \"Predictor's Cohort\" study on patients with advanced Alzheimer disease, we propose in this paper a semiparametric modeling approach to longitudinal health-related quality of life data. It builds upon and extends some recent developments for longitudinal data with irregular observation times. The new approach handles possibly dependent terminal events. It allows one to examine time-dependent covariate effects on the evolution of outcome variable and to assess nonparametrically change of outcome measurement that is due to factors not incorporated in the covariates. The usual large-sample properties for parameter estimation are established. In particular, it is shown that relevant parameter estimators are asymptotically normal and the asymptotic variances can be estimated consistently by the simple plug-in method. A general procedure for testing a specific parametric form in the nonparametric component is also developed. Simulation studies show that the proposed approach performs well for practical settings. The method is applied to the motivating example.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a non-parametric approach for comparing diagnostic accuracies in multi-reader receiver operating characteristic (ROC) studies. The approach constructs a test from each reader by extending the conventional non-parametric method and then combines all the individual test statistics to draw an overall conclusion on the relative accuracies of different diagnostic tests. The method can handle both continuous and ordinal data. Compared to the existing non-parametric methods, the method is robust and effectively deals with the possible heterogeneity among readers. It can also be applied to the analysis of correlated ROC studies. The method is applied to a real example and its finite sample performance is examined through simulation studies.",

        "Title": "Feasibility and validity of a modified finger-nose-finger test.",
        "Abstract": "In essential tremor (ET) research, it is important to obtain standardized, objective data on tremor severity. Often, it is not possible to carry out in-person or videotaped neurological examinations. In place of these, handwriting samples can be collected, but they do not capture all of the variance in tremor severity. Although additional tests of tremor severity (finger-nose-finger [FNF] test) might be of use, these would need to be modified to allow ET patients to mail their results to the study investigator for rating. We modified the standard FNF test (sFNF) by asking subjects to hold a pen during this activity and mark a paper target. The purpose of this report was to determine whether the modified FNF (mFNF) test was feasible and valid. Of 70 subjects, 65 (92.9%) were able to complete the mFNF, demonstrating that it was feasible. The scores of the mFNF correlated highly with those of the sFNF (r = 0.56-0.85; all P < 0.001), indicating the mFNF is a valid measure of tremor severity. In addition, using the regression equation, sFNF = 0.174(mFNF) + 0.743, a sFNF score can be derived easily from the mFNF score. The mFNF may be used to collect valuable data on tremor severity in pathological, genetic, and epidemiological field studies of ET, in which in-person or videotaped neurological examinations are not possible.",

        "Abstract": "Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is the most common regimen-related toxicity accompanying stem cell transplantation (SCT). Severe VOD complicated by multisystem organ failure (MOF) remains almost uniformly fatal. Preliminary experience with defibrotide (DF), a single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotide with fibrinolytic, antithrombotic, and anti-ischemic properties, in the treatment for severe VOD has suggested safety and activity. Eighty-eight patients who developed severe VOD after SCT were treated with DF under a defined treatment plan. At diagnosis, median bilirubin was 76.95 microM (4.5 mg/dL), median weight gain was 7%, ascites was present in 84%, and abnormal hepatic portal venous flow was present in 35%. At DF initiation, median bilirubin had increased to 215.46 microM (12.6 mg/dL), and MOF was present in 97%. DF was administered intravenously in doses ranging from 5 to 60 mg/kg per day for a median of 15 days. No severe hemorrhage or other serious toxicity related to DF was reported. Complete resolution of VOD was seen in 36%, with 35% survival at day +100. Predictors of survival included younger age, autologous SCT, and abnormal portal flow, whereas busulfan-based conditioning and encephalopathy predicted worse outcome. Decreases in mean creatinine and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1(PAI-1) levels during DF therapy predicted better survival. The complete response rate, survival to day +100, and absence of significant DF-associated toxicity in this largest patient cohort reported to date confirm the results of earlier studies. Certain features associated with successful outcome may correlate with DF-related treatment effects, and prospective evaluation of DF therapy for severe VOD should allow better definition of predictors of response or failure.",
