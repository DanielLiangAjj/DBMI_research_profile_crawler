        "Abstract": "LCAT (lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase) catalyzes the conversion of unesterified, or free cholesterol, to cholesteryl ester, which moves from the surface of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) into the neutral lipid core. As this iterative process continues, nascent lipid-poor HDL is converted to a series of larger, spherical cholesteryl ester-enriched HDL particles that can be cleared by the liver in a process that has been termed reverse cholesterol transport.",

        "Abstract": "The production and secretion of VLDLs (very-low-density lipoproteins) by hepatocytes has a direct impact on liver fat content, as well as the concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides in the circulation and thus affects both liver and cardiovascular health, respectively. Importantly, insulin resistance, excess caloric intake, and lack of physical activity are associated with overproduction of VLDL, hepatic steatosis, and increased plasma levels of atherogenic lipoproteins. Cholesterol and triglycerides in remnant particles generated by VLDL lipolysis are risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and have garnered increasing attention over the last few decades. Presently, however, increased risk of atherosclerosis is not the only concern when considering today's cardiometabolic patients, as they often also experience hepatic steatosis, a prevalent disorder that can progress to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. This duality of metabolic risk highlights the importance of understanding the molecular regulation of the biogenesis of VLDL, the lipoprotein that transports triglycerides and cholesterol out of the liver. Fortunately, there has been a resurgence of interest in the intracellular assembly, trafficking, degradation, and secretion of VLDL by hepatocytes, which has led to many exciting new molecular insights that are the topic of this review. Increasing our understanding of the biology of this pathway will aid to the identification of novel therapeutic targets to improve both the cardiovascular and the hepatic health of cardiometabolic patients. This review focuses, for the first time, on this duality.",

        "Abstract": "In 2014, exome-wide studies identified a glutamine176lysine (p.E167K) substitution in a protein of unknown function named transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2). The p.E167K variant was associated with increased hepatic fat content and reduced levels of plasma TG and LDL cholesterol. Over the next several years, additional studies defined the role of TM6SF2, which resides in the ER and the ER-Golgi interface, in the lipidation of nascent VLDL to generate mature, more TG-rich VLDL. Consistent results from cells and rodents indicated that the secretion of TG was reduced in the p.E167K variant or when hepatic TM6SF2 was deleted. However, data for secretion of APOB was inconsistent, either reduced or increased secretion was observed. A recent study of people homozygous for the variant demonstrated reduced in vivo secretion of large, TG-rich VLDL1 into plasma; both TG and APOB secretion were reduced. Here we present new results demonstrating increased secretion of VLDL APOB with no change in TG secretion in p.E167K homozygous individuals from the Lancaster Amish community compared to their wild-type siblings. Our in vivo kinetic tracer results are supported by in vitro experiments in HepG2 and McA cells with knock-down or Crispr-deletions of TM6SF2, respectively. We offer a model to potentially explain all of the prior data and our new results.",

        "Abstract": "Statins are the cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, even under optimal statin therapy, a significant residual ASCVD risk remains. Therefore, there has been an unmet clinical need for novel lipid-lowering agents that can target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other atherogenic particles. During the past decade, several drugs have been developed for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Inclisiran, a small interfering RNA that targets proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), shows comparable effects to that of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies. Bempedoic acid, an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor, is a valuable treatment option for the patients with statin intolerance. Pemafibrate, the first selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator, showed a favorable benefit-risk balance in phase 2 trial, but the large clinical phase 3 trial (PROMINENT) was recently stopped for futility based on a late interim analysis. High dose icosapent ethyl, a modified eicosapentaenoic acid preparation, shows cardiovascular benefits. Evinacumab, an angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) monoclonal antibody, reduces plasma LDL-C levels in patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia. Novel antisense oligonucleotides targeting apolipoprotein C3 (apoC3), ANGPTL3, and lipoprotein(a) have significantly attenuated the levels of their target molecules with beneficial effects on associated dyslipidemias. Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) is considered as a potential treatment to exploit the athero-protective effects of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), but solid clinical evidence is necessary. In this review, we discuss the mode of action and clinical outcomes of these novel lipid-lowering agents beyond statins.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate assessment of LDL-C levels is important, as they are often used for treatment recommendations. For many years, plasma LDL-C levels were calculated using the Friedewald equation, but there are limitations to this method compared with direct measurement via beta-quantification (BQ). Here, we assessed differences between the Friedewald, Martin-Hopkins, and NIH equation 2 methods of calculating LDL-C and the \"gold standard\" BQ method using pooled phase 3 data with alirocumab. All randomized patients were included irrespective of the treatment arm (n = 6,122). We compared pairs of LDL-C values (n = 17,077) determined by each equation and BQ. We found that BQ-derived LDL-C values ranged from 1 to 397 mg/dl (mean 90.68 mg/dl). There were strong correlations between Friedewald-calculated, Martin-Hopkins-calculated, and NIH equation 2-calculated LDL-C with BQ-determined LDL-C values (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.985, 0.981, and 0.985, respectively). Importantly, for BQ-derived LDL-C values ≥70 mg/dl, only 3.2%, 1.4%, and 1.8% of Friedewald-calculated, Martin-Hopkins-calculated, and NIH equation 2-calculated values were <70 mg/dl, respectively. When triglyceride (TG) levels were <150 mg/dl, differences between calculated and BQ-derived LDL-C values were minimal, regardless of the LDL-C level (<40, <55, or <70 mg/dl). However, when TG levels were >150 mg/dl, NIH equation 2 provided greater accuracy than Friedewald or Martin-Hopkins. When TGs were >250 mg/dl, inaccuracies were seen with all three methods, although NIH equation 2 remained the most accurate. In conclusion, LDL-C calculated by any of the three methods can guide treatment decisions for most patients, including those treated with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors.",

        "Abstract": "High levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], an apoB100-containing lipoprotein, are an independent and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases through mechanisms associated with increased atherogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Lp(a) is predominantly a monogenic cardiovascular risk determinant, with ≈70% to ≥90% of interindividual heterogeneity in levels being genetically determined. The 2 major protein components of Lp(a) particles are apoB100 and apolipoprotein(a). Lp(a) remains a risk factor for cardiovascular disease development even in the setting of effective reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoB100. Despite its demonstrated contribution to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease burden, we presently lack standardization and harmonization of assays, universal guidelines for diagnosing and providing risk assessment, and targeted treatments to lower Lp(a). There is a clinical need to understand the genetic and biological basis for variation in Lp(a) levels and its relationship to disease in different ancestry groups. This scientific statement capitalizes on the expertise of a diverse basic science and clinical workgroup to highlight the history, biology, pathophysiology, and emerging clinical evidence in the Lp(a) field. Herein, we address key knowledge gaps and future directions required to mitigate the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk attributable to elevated Lp(a) levels.",

        "Title": "Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants: metabolic insights, role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emerging therapeutic strategies-a consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society.",
        "Abstract": "Recent advances in human genetics, together with a large body of epidemiologic, preclinical, and clinical trial results, provide strong support for a causal association between triglycerides (TG), TG-rich lipoproteins (TRL), and TRL remnants, and increased risk of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and aortic valve stenosis. These data also indicate that TRL and their remnants may contribute significantly to residual cardiovascular risk in patients on optimized low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering therapy. This statement critically appraises current understanding of the structure, function, and metabolism of TRL, and their pathophysiological role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Key points are (i) a working definition of normo- and hypertriglyceridaemic states and their relation to risk of ASCVD, (ii) a conceptual framework for the generation of remnants due to dysregulation of TRL production, lipolysis, and remodelling, as well as clearance of remnant lipoproteins from the circulation, (iii) the pleiotropic proatherogenic actions of TRL and remnants at the arterial wall, (iv) challenges in defining, quantitating, and assessing the atherogenic properties of remnant particles, and (v) exploration of the relative atherogenicity of TRL and remnants compared to LDL. Assessment of these issues provides a foundation for evaluating approaches to effectively reduce levels of TRL and remnants by targeting either production, lipolysis, or hepatic clearance, or a combination of these mechanisms. This consensus statement updates current understanding in an integrated manner, thereby providing a platform for new therapeutic paradigms targeting TRL and their remnants, with the aim of reducing the risk of ASCVD.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes is now a pandemic disease. Moreover, a large number of people with prediabetes are at risk for developing frank diabetes worldwide. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Even with statin treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, patients with diabetes have a high residual CVD risk. Factors mediating the residual risk are incompletely characterized. An attractive hypothesis is that remnant lipoprotein particles (RLPs), derived by lipolysis from VLDL and chylomicrons, contribute to this residual risk. RLPs constitute a heterogeneous population of lipoprotein particles, varying markedly in size and composition. Although a universally accepted definition is lacking, for the purpose of this review we define RLPs as postlipolytic partially triglyceride-depleted particles derived from chylomicrons and VLDL that are relatively enriched in cholesteryl esters and apolipoprotein (apo)E. RLPs derived from chylomicrons contain apoB48, while those derived from VLDL contain apoB100. Clarity as to the role of RLPs in CVD risk is hampered by lack of a widely accepted definition and a paucity of adequate methods for their accurate and precise quantification. New specific methods for RLP quantification would greatly improve our understanding of their biology and role in promoting atherosclerosis in diabetes and other disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Hypertriglyceridaemia is a common clinical problem. Epidemiologic and genetic studies have established that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and their remnants as important contributors to ASCVD while severe hypertriglyceridaemia raises risk of pancreatitis. While low-density lipoprotein is the primary treatment target for lipid lowering therapy, secondary targets that reflect the contribution of TRL such as apoB and non-HDL-C are recommended in the current guidelines. Reduction of severely elevated triglycerides is important to avert or reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Here we discuss interventions for hypertriglyceridaemia, including diet and lifestyle, established treatments such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acid preparations and emerging therapies, including various biological agents.",

        "Abstract": "Genome sequencing and gene-based therapies appear poised to advance the management of rare lipoprotein disorders and associated dyslipidaemias. However, in practice, underdiagnosis and undertreatment of these disorders are common, in large part due to interindividual variability in the genetic causes and phenotypic presentation of these conditions. To address these challenges, the European Atherosclerosis Society formed a task force to provide practical clinical guidance focusing on patients with extreme concentrations (either low or high) of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The task force also recognises the scarcity of quality information regarding the prevalence and outcomes of these conditions. Collaborative registries are needed to improve health policy for the care of patients with rare dyslipidaemias.",

        "Abstract": "In this issue of the JCI, Kanter et al. make a strong case for implicating apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) as a central player in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that is commonly seen in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Kanter and colleagues suggest that insulin deficiency elevates plasma APOC3 as well as atherogenic triglyceride-rich (TG-rich) lipoproteins (TRLs). Using two mouse models of T1DM, the authors investigated APOC3-mediated inhibition of both TG hydrolysis by lipoprotein lipase and hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins. They suggest that poorly catabolized lipoproteins, enriched in both APOC3 and APOE content, are particularly atherogenic. Notably, treating both mouse models with an APOC3 antisense oligonucleotide lowered both plasma APOC3 and TRLs, and prevented atherosclerosis. These impactful mouse studies were supported by the initial finding that APOC3 predicted coronary artery disease events in participants of the prospective Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study with normal TG levels.",

        "Abstract": "Background In statin trials, men and women derived similar relative risk reductions in cardiovascular events per 39 mg/ dL low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL -C) reduction. We explored whether lower LDL -C levels and greater LDL -C percentage reductions than those achieved with statins are associated with reduced major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) rates in women as well as men. Methods and Results Data pooled from 10 phase 3 ODYSSEY randomized trials (n=4983) comparing alirocumab with control (placebo/ezetimibe) were assessed for association between 39 mg/dL lower on-treatment LDL -C and percentage LDL -C change from baseline, and MACE risk by sex, using multivariable Cox regression. Mean baseline LDL -C was 135 mg/dL (women) and 121 mg/dL (men). Average on-treatment LDL -C levels with alirocumab, ezetimibe, and placebo were 71, 114, and 134 mg/dL, respectively, in women (n=1882) and 52, 93, and 122 mg/dL, respectively, in men (n=3090). Overall, 36.5% and 58.7% of women and men, respectively, achieved on-treatment LDL -C <50 mg/dL. Each 39 mg/dL lower LDL -C was associated with a 33% and 22% lower risk of MACE in women ( P=0.0209) and men ( P=0.0307), respectively, with no significant between-sex difference ( P for heterogeneity=0.4597). Results were similar when analyzed per 50% LDL -C reduction, 24% ( P=0.1094) and 29% ( P=0.0125) lower MACE risk in women and men, respectively ( P for heterogeneity=0.7499). Alirocumab was generally well tolerated in both sexes. Conclusions The present analysis reinforces the notion that both sexes derive a similar cardiovascular benefit from LDL -C lowering. Although women had slightly higher on-treatment LDL -C than men, both sexes showed a similar lower MACE risk with lower LDL -C.",

However, it is unclear whether the degree of PPL independently predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) given the scarcity of longitudinal data with standardised measures of postprandial change.

Although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 inhibitors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism. In particular, it is not known whether inhibition of PCSK9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) metabolism. Inhibition of PCSK9 also results in reductions of plasma lipoprotein (a) levels. The regulation of plasma Lp(a) levels, including the role of LDL receptors in the clearance of Lp(a), is poorly defined, and no mechanistic studies of the Lp(a) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date.",

        "Abstract": "A continuous relationship between reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) has been observed in statin and ezetimibe outcomes trials down to achieved levels of 54 mg/dL. However, it is uncertain whether this relationship extends to LDL-C levels <50 mg/dL. We assessed the relationship between additional LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B100 reductions and MACE among patients within the ODYSSEY trials that compared alirocumab with controls (placebo/ezetimibe), mainly as add-on therapy to maximally tolerated statin.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibition of VLDL secretion reduces plasma levels of atherogenic apolipoprotein B (apoB) lipoproteins but can also cause hepatic steatosis. Approaches targeting apoB synthesis, which lies upstream of VLDL secretion, have potential to effectively reduce dyslipidemia but can also lead to hepatic accumulation of unsecreted triglycerides (TG). Here, we found that treating mice with apoB antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for 6 weeks decreased VLDL secretion and plasma cholesterol without causing steatosis. The absence of steatosis was linked to an increase in ER stress in the first 3 weeks of ASO treatment, followed by development of ER autophagy at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. The latter resulted in increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation that was inhibited by both chloroquine and 3-methyl adenine, consistent with trafficking of ER TG through the autophagic pathway before oxidation. These findings support the concept that inhibition of apoB synthesis traps lipids that have been transferred to the ER by microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP), inducing ER stress. ER stress then triggers ER autophagy and subsequent lysosomal lipolysis of TG, followed by mitochondrial oxidation of released FA, leading to prevention of steatosis. The identification of this pathway indicates that inhibition of VLDL secretion remains a viable target for therapies aiming to reduce circulating levels of atherogenic apoB lipoproteins.",

        "Abstract": "Dyslipidemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is usually characterized by hypertriglyceridemia. Here we studied postprandial lipemia in children and young adults to determine whether an increasing degree of CKD results in a proportional increase in triglyceride and chylomicron concentration. Secondary goals were to determine whether subnephrotic proteinuria, apolipoprotein (apo)C-III and insulin resistance modify the CKD effect. Eighteen fasting participants (mean age of 15 years, mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 50 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) underwent a postprandial challenge with a high fat milkshake. Triglycerides, apoB-48, insulin, and other markers were measured before and 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours afterward. Response was assessed by the incremental area under the curve of triglycerides and of apoB-48. The primary hypothesis was tested by correlation to estimated GFR. Significantly, for every 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2) lower estimated GFR, the incremental area under the curve of triglycerides was 17% greater while that of apoB-48 was 16% greater. Univariate analyses also showed that the incremental area under the curve of triglycerides and apoB-48 were significantly associated with subnephrotic proteinuria, apoC-III, and insulin resistance. In multivariate analysis, CKD and insulin resistance were independently associated with increased area under the curve and were each linked to increased levels of apoC-III. Thus, postprandial triglyceride and chylomicron plasma excursions are increased in direct proportion to the degree of CKD. Independent effects are associated with subclinical insulin resistance and increased apoC-III is linked to both CKD and insulin resistance.",

The mechanisms responsible for these treatment-related increases in apolipoproteins and plasma CETP are unknown.

        "Abstract": "Mipomersen is a 20mer antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that inhibits apolipoprotein B (apoB) synthesis; its low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering effects should therefore result from reduced secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). We enrolled 17 healthy volunteers who received placebo injections weekly for 3 weeks followed by mipomersen weekly for 7 to 9 weeks. Stable isotopes were used after each treatment to determine fractional catabolic rates and production rates of apoB in VLDL, IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein), and LDL, and of triglycerides in VLDL. Mipomersen significantly reduced apoB in VLDL, IDL, and LDL, which was associated with increases in fractional catabolic rates of VLDL and LDL apoB and reductions in production rates of IDL and LDL apoB. Unexpectedly, the production rates of VLDL apoB and VLDL triglycerides were unaffected. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of apoB expression in human liver cells demonstrated preservation of apoB secretion across a range of apoB synthesis. Titrated ASO knockdown of apoB mRNA in chow-fed mice preserved both apoB and triglyceride secretion. In contrast, titrated ASO knockdown of apoB mRNA in high-fat-fed mice resulted in stepwise reductions in both apoB and triglyceride secretion. Mipomersen lowered all apoB lipoproteins without reducing the production rate of either VLDL apoB or triglyceride. Our human data are consistent with long-standing models of posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation of apoB secretion and are supported by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Targeting apoB synthesis may lower levels of apoB lipoproteins without necessarily reducing VLDL secretion, thereby lowering the risk of steatosis associated with this therapeutic strategy.",

        "Abstract": "Pharmacological reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol using statin drugs is foundational therapy to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Here, we consider the place of nonstatin therapies that also reduce LDL cholesterol in prevention of CVD. Among conventional nonstatins, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials showed that bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and fibrates given as monotherapy each reduce CVD end points. From trials in which patients' LDL cholesterol was already well controlled on a statin, adding ezetimibe incrementally reduced CVD end points, whereas adding a fibrate or niacin showed no incremental benefit. Among emerging nonstatins, monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 added to a statin and given for ≤78 weeks showed preliminary evidence of reductions in CVD outcomes. Although these promising early findings contributed to the recent approval of these agents in Europe and in North America, much larger and longer duration outcomes studies are ongoing for definitive proof of CVD benefits. Other nonstatin agents recently approved in the United States include lomitapide and mipomersen, which both act via distinctive LDL receptor independent mechanisms to substantially reduce LDL cholesterol in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. We also address some unanswered questions, including measuring alternative biochemical variables to LDL cholesterol, evidence for treating children with monitoring of subclinical atherosclerosis, and potential risks of extremely low LDL cholesterol. As evidence for benefit in CVD prevention accumulates, we anticipate that clinical practice will shift toward more assertive LDL-lowering treatment, using both statins and nonstatins initiated earlier in appropriately selected patients.",

        "Abstract": "Autophagy is an essential cellular pathway by which protein aggregates, long-lived proteins, or defective organelles are sequestered in double membrane vesicles and then degraded upon fusion of those vesicles with lysosomes. Although autophagy plays a critical role in maintaining intracellular homeostasis and keeping the cell in a healthy state, this key pathway can become dysregulated in various cardiometabolic disorders, such as; obesity, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and insulin resistance. In these conditions, autophagy may actually worsen the pathological state instead of protecting the cell or organism. In this review, we discuss how dysregulated autophagy may be linked to increases in cardiovascular risk factors, and how manipulation of the autophagic machinery might reduce those risks.",

        "Abstract": "Plasma triglyceride concentration is a biomarker for circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their metabolic remnants. Common mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridaemia is typically multigenic, and results from the cumulative burden of common and rare variants in more than 30 genes, as quantified by genetic risk scores. Rare autosomal recessive monogenic hypertriglyceridaemia can result from large-effect mutations in six different genes. Hypertriglyceridaemia is exacerbated by non-genetic factors. On the basis of recent genetic data, we redefine the disorder into two states: severe (triglyceride concentration >10 mmol/L), which is more likely to have a monogenic cause; and mild-to-moderate (triglyceride concentration 2-10 mmol/L). Because of clustering of susceptibility alleles and secondary factors in families, biochemical screening and counselling for family members is essential, but routine genetic testing is not warranted. Treatment includes management of lifestyle and secondary factors, and pharmacotherapy. In severe hypertriglyceridaemia, intervention is indicated because of pancreatitis risk; in mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridaemia, intervention can be indicated to prevent cardiovascular disease, dependent on triglyceride concentration, concomitant lipoprotein disturbances, and overall cardiovascular risk.",

        "Abstract": "Acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 1 catalyzes the final step of triglyceride (TG) synthesis. We show that acute administration of a DGAT1 inhibitor (DGAT1i) by oral gavage or genetic deletion of intestinal Dgat1 (intestine-Dgat1(-/-)) markedly reduced postprandial plasma TG and retinyl ester excursions by inhibiting chylomicron secretion in mice. Loss of DGAT1 activity did not affect the efficiency of retinol esterification, but it did reduce TG and retinoid accumulation in the small intestine. In contrast, inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) reduced chylomicron secretion after oral fat/retinol loads, but with accumulation of dietary TG and retinoids in the small intestine. Lack of intestinal accumulation of TG and retinoids in DGAT1i-treated or intestine-Dgat1(-/-) mice resulted, in part, from delayed gastric emptying associated with increased plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1. However, neither bypassing the stomach through duodenal oil injection nor inhibiting the receptor for GLP-1 normalized postprandial TG or retinyl esters excursions in the absence of DGAT1 activity. In summary, intestinal DGAT1 inhibition or deficiency acutely delayed gastric emptying and inhibited chylomicron secretion; however, the latter occurred when gastric emptying was normal or when lipid was administered directly into the small intestine. Long-term hepatic retinoid metabolism was not impacted by DGAT1 inhibition.",

        "Abstract": "We recently reported that inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) by antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) improved hepatic lipid metabolism independent of food intake. In that study, 11β-HSD1 ASO-treated mice lost weight compared with food-matched control ASO-treated mice, suggesting treatment-mediated increased energy expenditure. We have now examined the effects of 11β-HSD1 ASO treatment on adipose tissue metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and whole-body energy expenditure. We used an ASO to knock down 11β-HSD1 in C57BL/6J mice consuming a Western-type diet (WTD). The 11β-HSD1 ASO-treated mice consumed less food, so food-matched control ASO-treated mice were also evaluated. We characterized body composition, gene expression of individual adipose depots, and measures of energy metabolism. We also investigated glucose/insulin tolerance as well as acute insulin signaling in several tissues. Knockdown of 11β-HSD1 protected against WTD-induced obesity by reducing epididymal, mesenteric, and subcutaneous white adipose tissue while activating thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. The latter was confirmed by demonstrating increased energy expenditure in 11β-HSD1 ASO-treated mice. The 11β-HSD1 ASO treatment also protected against WTD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance; this protection was associated with smaller cells and fewer macrophages in epididymal white adipose tissue as well as enhanced in vivo insulin signaling. Our results indicate that ASO-mediated inhibition of 11β-HSD1 can protect against several WTD-induced metabolic abnormalities.

        "Abstract": "Although short-term incubation of hepatocytes with oleic acid (OA) stimulates secretion of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), exposure to higher doses of OA for longer periods inhibits secretion in association with induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Palmitic acid (PA) induces ER stress, but its effects on apoB100 secretion are unclear. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibits apoB100 secretion, but its effects on ER stress have not been studied. We compared the effects of each of these fatty acids on ER stress and apoB100 secretion in McArdle RH7777 (McA) cells: OA and PA induced ER stress and inhibited apoB100 secretion at higher doses; PA was more potent because it also increased the synthesis of ceramide. DHA did not induce ER stress but was the most potent inhibitor of apoB100 secretion, acting via stimulation of autophagy. These unique effects of each fatty acid were confirmed when they were infused into C57BL6J mice. Our results suggest that when both increased hepatic secretion of VLDL apoB100 and hepatic steatosis coexist, reducing ER stress might alleviate hepatic steatosis but at the expense of increased VLDL secretion. In contrast, increasing autophagy might reduce VLDL secretion without causing steatosis.",

IR is associated with increased secretion of VLDL and increased plasma triglycerides, as well as with hepatic steatosis, despite the increased VLDL secretion. Here we link IR with increased VLDL secretion and hepatic steatosis at both the physiologic and molecular levels. Increased VLDL secretion, together with the downstream effects on high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) size, is proatherogenic. Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Understanding the complex inter-relationships between IR and these abnormalities of liver lipid homeostasis will provide insights relevant to new therapies for these increasing clinical problems.",

        "Abstract": "Even at low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal, patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. This paper aims (i) to critically appraise evidence for elevated levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as cardiovascular risk factors, and (ii) to advise on therapeutic strategies for management. Current evidence supports a causal association between elevated TRL and their remnants, low HDL-C, and cardiovascular risk. This interpretation is based on mechanistic and genetic studies for TRL and remnants, together with the epidemiological data suggestive of the association for circulating triglycerides and cardiovascular disease. For HDL, epidemiological, mechanistic, and clinical intervention data are consistent with the view that low HDL-C contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk; genetic evidence is unclear however, potentially reflecting the complexity of HDL metabolism. The Panel believes that therapeutic targeting of elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL), a marker of TRL and their remnants, and/or low HDL-C (<1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) may provide further benefit. The first step should be lifestyle interventions together with consideration of compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia. If inadequately corrected, adding niacin or a fibrate, or intensifying LDL-C lowering therapy may be considered. Treatment decisions regarding statin combination therapy should take into account relevant safety concerns, i.e. the risk of elevation of blood glucose, uric acid or liver enzymes with niacin, and myopathy, increased serum creatinine and cholelithiasis with fibrates. These recommendations will facilitate reduction in the substantial cardiovascular risk that persists in patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities at LDL-C goal.",

        "Abstract": "11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) converts inactive 11-keto derivatives to active glucocorticoids within tissues and may play a role in the metabolic syndrome (MS). We used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to knock down 11β-HSD1 in livers of C57BL/6J mice consuming a Western-type diet (WTD). 11β-HSD1 ASO-treated mice consumed less food, so we compared them to ad libitum-fed mice and to food-matched mice receiving control ASO. Knockdown of 11β-HSD1 directly protected mice from WTD-induced steatosis and dyslipidemia by reducing synthesis and secretion of triglyceride (TG) and increasing hepatic fatty acid oxidation. These changes in hepatic and plasma lipids were not associated with reductions in genes involved in de novo lipogenesis. However, protein levels of both sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1 and fatty acid synthase were significantly reduced in mice treated with 11β-HSD1 ASO. There was no change in hepatic secretion of apolipoprotein (apo)B, indicating assembly and secretion of smaller apoB-containing lipoproteins by the liver in the 11β-HSD1-treated mice. Our results indicate that inhibition of 11β-HSD1 by ASO treatment of WTD-fed mice resulted in improved plasma and hepatic lipid levels, reduced lipogenesis by posttranslational regulation, and secretion of similar numbers of apoB-containing lipoproteins containing less TG per particle.",

Experimental sleep restriction has been shown to significantly increase total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels in women. Short sleep duration has been found in cross sectional studies to be associated with higher total cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol levels. Sleep deprivation could increase the risk for hypercholesterolemia by increasing appetite and dietary consumption of saturated fats, decreasing motivation to engage in regular physical activity, and increasing stress and resultant catecholamine induced lipolysis. No previous published population studies have examined the longitudinal relationship between sleep duration and high cholesterol.",

        "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to determine if individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) had greater endothelial dysfunction (ED) than individuals with only CAD. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), calculated as percentage increase in brachial artery diameter in response to postischemic blood flow, was measured after an overnight fast in 2 cohorts. The first cohort included 76 participants in the Northern Manhattan Study with CAD; 25 also had T2DM. The second cohort was composed of 27 individuals with both T2DM and CAD who were participants in a study of postprandial lipemia. Combined, we analyzed 103 patients with CAD: 52 with T2DM (T2DM+) and 51 without T2DM (T2DM-). The 52 CAD T2DM+ subjects had a mean FMD of 3.9% +/- 3.2%, whereas the 51 CAD T2DM- subjects had a greater mean FMD of 5.5% +/- 4.0% (P < .03). An investigation of various confounders known to affect FMD identified age and body mass index as the only significant covariates in a multiple regression model. Adjusting for age and body mass index, we found that FMD remained lower in T2DM+ subjects compared with T2DM- subjects (difference, -1.99%; P < .03). In patients with CAD, the concomitant presence of T2DM is independently associated with greater ED, as measured by FMD. This finding may be relevant to the greater early and late morbidity and mortality observed in patients with both CAD and T2DM.",

(c)2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Strategies for the effective management of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with the metabolic syndrome (MS) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are essential to help reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Treatment strategies should be multifactorial and include the promotion of therapeutic lifestyle changes, as well as pharmacologic therapies to treat individual risk factors according to current guidelines. In an accompanying article, the importance of atherogenic dyslipidemia as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with MS or T2DM was highlighted. Current treatment options for managing this characteristic form of atherogenic dyslipidemia are limited and tend to be only moderately effective. The focus of this review is the current pharmacotherapies available for the management of atherogenic dyslipidemia in patients with the MS or T2DM, highlighting the rationale for combining available treatments. Novel strategies currently in clinical development are also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Both the metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) confer an increased risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease (CVD). As MS and T2DM become more prevalent, there will be an associated rise in the number of individuals with or at risk for CVD and its related disorders. One major underlying cause of CVD in patients with MS or T2DM is a characteristic form of atherogenic dyslipidemia. This article reviews the evidence that demonstrates that individuals with MS or T2DM are at increased risk for CVD and highlights atherogenic dyslipidemia as an important risk factor for the development of CVD in these individuals. In an accompanying article, current pharmacotherapies available for the management of atherogenic dyslipidemia in individuals with MS or T2DM are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the essential protein required for the assembly and secretion of chylomicrons from the small intestine and VLDLs from the liver. These lipoproteins, as well as their remnants and LDL, play key roles in the transport of dietary and endogenously synthesized lipids throughout the body. However, they can be involved in the initiation of atherosclerotic lesions in the vessel wall. Therefore, it is not surprising that the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the small intestine and liver is a highly regulated process. In particular, cotranslational and posttranslational targeting of apoB for degradation, regulated largely by the availability of the core lipids carried in the lipoprotein, by the types of dietary fatty acids consumed, and by the hormonal milieu, determines the number of chylomicrons or VLDL that are secreted. In this review, we summarize both older and more recent findings on the pathways of apoB degradation, focusing on events in the liver.",

        "Abstract": "Combination therapy for the treatment of dyslipidemia and reduction of cardiovascular risk has been demonstrated to beneficially modify the lipid profile in multiple randomized clinical trials. As reported in the updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remains the primary treatment target, although the comprehensive management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients includes the modification of secondary lipid parameters such as triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although statin therapy is the standard intervention for lowering LDL cholesterol, combination therapy has demonstrated added benefits on secondary lipid parameters and enhances statin-mediated reductions in LDL cholesterol. The benefits of modifying these secondary targets on all-cause or cardiovascular event-related mortality are currently under investigation in several clinical trials. Prescription omega-3 fatty acid (Lovaza) is a formulation of 2 highly purified omega-3-acid ethyl esters, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. The recently completed Combination of Prescription Omega-3 With Simvastatin (COMBOS) study confirmed that prescription omega-3 fatty acid administered in combination with simvastatin achieves statistically significant improvements across a range of lipid indicators beyond the LDL primary target, including triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipoprotein particle size. In conclusion, several classes of drugs, including omega-3 fatty acids, can be used in combination with statins to achieve more global improvements in lipid profiles.",

        "Abstract": "Although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established atherogenic factor for coronary heart disease, it does not completely represent the risk associated with atherogenic lipoproteins in the presence of high triglyceride (TG) levels. Constituent lipoproteins constituting non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) include atherogenic TG-rich lipoproteins, cholesteryl ester-enriched remnants of TG-rich lipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a). Recent observational and intervention studies suggest that the predictive value of non-HDL-C for cardiovascular risk and mortality is better than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and that non-HDL-C correlates highly with plasma apolipoprotein B levels. Currently, the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines identify non-HDL-C as a secondary target of therapy in patients with TG elevation (> or =200 mg/dl) after the attainment of LDL-C target goals. In patients with coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease risk equivalents, an optional non-HDL-C goal is <100 mg/dl. To achieve the non-HDL-C goal, statin therapy may be intensified or combined with ezetimibe, niacin, a fibrate, or omega-3 fatty acids. In conclusion, non-HDL-C remains an important target of therapy for patients with elevated TGs, although its widespread adoption has yet to gain a foothold among health care professionals treating patients with dyslipidemia.",

        "Abstract": "Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is common in individuals with insulin resistance, and diets enriched in 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG) may reduce postprandial plasma triglycerides (PPTGs). We enrolled 25 insulin-resistant, nondiabetic individuals in a double-blind, randomized crossover trial to test the acute and chronic effects of a DAG-enriched diet on PPTG. Participants received either DAG or triacylglycerol (TAG) oil, in food products, for 5 weeks. Fasting lipids, and two separate postprandial tests, one with DAG oil and one with TAG oil, were performed at the end of each 5 week diet period. We found no acute or chronic effects of DAG oil on PPTG. Thus, neither the DAG oil PPTG (h/mg/dl) on a chronic TAG diet [area under the curve (AUC) = 503 +/- 439] nor the TAG oil PPTG on a chronic DAG diet (AUC = 517 +/- 638) was different from the TAG oil PPTG on a chronic TAG diet (AUC = 565 +/- 362). Five weeks of a DAG-enriched diet had no acute or chronic effects on PPTG in insulin-resistant individuals. We suggest further studies to evaluate the effects of DAG on individuals with low and high TG levels.",

        "Abstract": "ER stress can cause hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Increased VLDL secretion could protect the liver from ER stress-induced steatosis, but the effect of lipid-induced ER stress on the secretion of VLDL is unknown. To determine the effect of lipids on hepatic ER stress and VLDL secretion, we treated McA-RH7777 liver cells with free fatty acids. Prolonged exposure increased cell triglycerides, induced steatosis, and increased ER stress. Effects on apoB100 secretion, which is required for VLDL assembly, were parabolic, with moderate free fatty acid exposure increasing apoB100 secretion, while greater lipid loading inhibited apoB100 secretion. This decreased secretion at higher lipid levels was due to increased protein degradation through both proteasomal and nonproteasomal pathways and was dependent on the induction of ER stress. These findings were supported in vivo, where intravenous infusion of oleic acid (OA) in mice increased ER stress in a duration-dependent manner. apoB secretion was again parabolic, stimulated by moderate, but not prolonged, OA infusion. Inhibition of ER stress was able to restore OA-stimulated apoB secretion after prolonged OA infusion. These results suggest that excessive ER stress in response to increased hepatic lipids may decrease the ability of the liver to secrete triglycerides by limiting apoB secretion, potentially worsening steatosis.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the effect of dietary 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG) on the development of insulin resistance (IR) and obesity, brown adipose tissue-deficient mice, a model of high-fat diet-induced IR and obesity, were fed Western-type diets (WTD) containing either DAG oil (n = 8) or standard triacylglycerol (TAG) oil (n = 9) for 15 weeks, beginning at 8 weeks of age. Although brown adipose tissue-deficient mice became obese on both TAG- and DAG-enriched WTD (TAG-WTD and DAG-WTD), the mice eating DAG-WTD gained less weight and had less body fat accumulation. The results of glucose tolerance tests conducted after 5 weeks of each WTD were not different. However, after 10 weeks of each WTD, impaired glucose tolerance developed in the TAG-WTD group but was prevented by DAG-WTD. Exploratory analyses of gene expression suggested that consumption of DAG-WTD was associated with reduced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression in liver and increased expression of the genes for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, lipoprotein lipase, and uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 in skeletal muscle. There were no effects of the DAG-WTD on fasting and postprandial plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, hepatic TG content, or the rate of secretion of TG from the liver. These findings suggest that diets enriched in 1,3-DAG oil may reduce WTD-induced IR and body fat accumulation by suppressing gluconeogenesis in liver and stimulating fat oxidation in skeletal muscle.",

        "Abstract": "The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) lipid trial aims to test whether a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) plus a fibrate is more efficacious in reducing cardiovascular events than a statin plus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with defined glycemic control. This is a blinded component in a 5,518-patient subset of the ACCORD cohort. These participants were randomized to either be (1) treated with simvastatin (titrated to 40 mg/day if necessary to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level of <2.59 mmol/L [100 mg/dL]) plus placebo or (2) treated to the same goal LDL cholesterol level with the statin plus active fenofibrate 160 mg/day or its bioequivalent (or 54 mg/day if the estimated glomerular filtration rate ranges from 30 to <50 mL/min per 1.73 m2). Setting an upper limit of LDL cholesterol qualifying for randomization excluded patients who would not likely achieve the LDL cholesterol goal. Recruitment for ACCORD began in January 2001, and follow-up is scheduled to end in June 2009. Since recruitment began, several clinical trials and consensus statements have been published that led to changes in the details of the lipid treatment algorithm and protocol. This report describes the design of the lipid protocol and modifications to the protocol during the course of the study in response to and in anticipation of these developments. The current protocol is designed to provide an ethically justifiable test of combined statin plus fibrate treatment consistent with the highest level of safety and lipid treatment standards of care.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at rates 2-4 times higher than patients without diabetes but with similar demographic characteristics. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing in the United States and, thus, the prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes poses an urgent public health challenge. The objective of this report is to review the current knowledge base for the prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes, with particular emphasis on the control of glycemia, lipids, and blood pressure. Epidemiologic analyses suggest that each 1% increase in glycosylated hemoglobin increases the risk for CVD by approximately 18%; however, evidence from the randomized trials that have examined whether glucose lowering reduces this risk is conflicting. Randomized trials have shown that lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduces CVD event rates by 17%-43% in patients with diabetes. Limited data support a role for lowering triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the prevention of CVD. Evidence from clinical trials shows that reducing systolic blood pressure to <140 mm Hg results in 30%-60% reductions in CVD events; however, epidemiologic evidence suggests that lowering to optimal systolic blood pressure levels (<120 mm Hg) may be additionally beneficial. Important questions regarding prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes remain unresolved, including the benefits of near-normal glycemic control, comprehensive therapy for diabetes-related dyslipidemia, and optimal blood pressure control. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial will test hypotheses to address these unanswered questions.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) is associated with a characteristic dyslipidemia. Findings in children with CRI largely parallel those in adults. Moderate hypertriglyceridemia, increased triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and reduced high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are the most usual findings, whereas total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) remain normal or modestly increased. Qualitative abnormalities in lipoproteins are common, including small dense LDL, oxidized LDL, and cholesterol-enriched TRL. Measures of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activity are reduced, and concentrations of apolipoprotein C-III are markedly elevated. Still an active area of research, major pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the dyslipidemia of CRI include insulin resistance and nonnephrotic proteinuria. Sources of variability in the severity of this dyslipidemia include the degree of renal impairment and the modality of dialysis. The benefits of maintaining normal body weight and physical activity extend to those with CRI. In addition to multiple hypolipidemic pharmaceuticals, fish oils are also effective as a triglyceride-lowering agent, and the phosphorous binding agent sevelamer also lowers LDL-C. Emerging classes of hypolipidemic agents and drugs affecting sensitivity to insulin may impact future treatment. Unfortunately, cardiovascular benefit has not been convincingly demonstrated by any trial designed to study adults or children with renal disease. Therefore, it is not possible at this time to endorse general recommendations for the use of any agent to treat dyslipidemia in children with chronic kidney disease.",

        "Abstract": "Prior studies have suggested that FAs liberated in the small intestine from ingested 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG) are inefficiently incorporated into triglyceride (TG) in enterocytes, with less chylomicron TG entering the circulation postprandially. We found less TG, but more monacylglyerol and DAG, with similar total acylglycerol in newly secreted chylomicrons after oral DAG or triacylglycerol (TAG). However, clearance of DAG-chylomicrons was more rapid than that of TAG-chylomicrons; this was associated with more efficient in vitro LPL-mediated lipolysis of DAG-derived chylomicrons. Intravenously infused DAG was also cleared faster than TAG in normal mice, via both LPL-mediated lipolysis and apolipoprotein E (apoE)-dependent hepatic uptake. Infusions of TAG, but not DAG, increased plasma TG levels. Greater delivery of DAG-derived FA to the liver during infusion of DAG led to greater TG secretion versus TAG; this allowed the maintenance of similar hepatic TG levels after DAG and TAG infusions. Of note, apoB secretion was similar after DAG versus TAG, indicating the assembly of larger very low density lipoproteins after DAG. In conclusion, reduced plasma TG levels, after oral or intravenous DAG, result from more efficient clearance of DAG by both LPL lipolysis and apoE-mediated hepatic endocytosis. DAG emulsions may by useful for intravenous nutrition in people with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin-resistant apoB/BATless mice have hypertriglyceridemia because of increased assembly and secretion of very low density apolipoprotein B (apoB) and triglycerides compared with mice expressing only apoB (Siri, P., Candela, N., Ko, C., Zhang, Y., Eusufzai, S., Ginsberg, H. N., and Huang, L. S. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 46064-46072). Despite increased very low density lipoprotein secretion, apoB/BATless mice have fatty livers. We found that hepatic mRNA levels of key lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty-acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 were increased in apoB/BATless mice compared with levels in apoB mice, suggesting increased lipogenesis in apoB/BATless mice. This was confirmed by determining incorporation of tritiated water into fatty acids. Neither the hepatic mRNA of the lipogenic transcription factor, SREBP-1c (sterol-response element-binding protein 1c), nor the nuclear levels of the mature form of SREBP-1 protein were elevated in apoB/BATless mice. By contrast, hepatic levels of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor 2 (PPARgamma2) mRNA and protein were specifically increased in apoB/BATless mice, as were hepatic mRNA levels of two targets of PPARgamma, CD36 and aP2. Treatment of apoB/BATless mice for 4 weeks with intraperitoneal injections of a PPARgamma antisense oligonucleotide resulted in dramatic reductions of both PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2 mRNA, PPARgamma2 protein, and mRNA levels of fatty-acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. These changes were associated with decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis and hepatic triglyceride concentrations. We conclude that hepatic steatosis in apoB/BATless mice is associated with elevated rates of hepatic lipogenesis that are linked directly to increased hepatic expression of PPARgamma2. The mechanism whereby hepatic Ppargamma2 gene expression is increased and how PPARgamma2 stimulates lipogenesis is under investigation.",

        "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease. A complex dyslipidemia, which is an integral part of the underlying insulin resistance in this group, is a key to this increased risk. Increased secretion of VLDL from the liver is a central feature of dyslipidemia and is linked significantly to the low HDL and abnormal LDL that are also present. A number of physiologic and pharmacologic approaches are available and should be used aggressively to treat diabetic dyslipidemia.",

        "Title": "Translocation efficiency of apolipoprotein B is determined by the presence of beta-sheet domains, not pause transfer sequences.",
        "Abstract": "Cotranslational translocation of apoB100 across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is inefficient, resulting in exposure of nascent apoB on the cytosolic surface of the ER. This predisposes apoB100 to ubiquitinylation and targeting for proteasomal degradation. It has been suggested that pause transfer sequences (PTS) present throughout apoB cause inefficient translocation. On the other hand, our previous study demonstrated that the translocation efficiency of apoB100 is dependent on the presence of a beta-sheet domain between 29 and 34% of full-length apoB100 (Liang, J.-S., Wu, X., Jiang, H., Zhou, M., Yang, H., Angkeow, P., Huang, L.-S., Sturley, S. L., and Ginsberg, H. N. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 35216-35221); this region of apoB has no PTS. However, the effects of the beta-sheet domain may require the presence of PTS elsewhere in the N-terminal region of apoB100. To further investigate the roles of PTS and beta-sheet domains in the translocation of apoB100 across the ER, we transfected McArdle RH7777, HepG2, or Chinese hamster ovary cells with human albumin (ALB)/human apoB chimeric cDNA constructs: ALB/B12-17 (two PTS but no beta-sheet), ALB/B29-34 (beta-sheet but no PTS), ALB/B36-41 (two PTS and a beta-sheet), and ALB/B49-54 (neither PTS nor a beta-sheet). ALB/ALB1-40 served as a control. Compared with ALB/ALB1-40, secretion rates of ALB/B12-17, ALB/B29-34, and ALB/B36-41 were reduced. Secretion of ALB/B49-54 was similar to that of ALB/ALB1-40. However, only ALB/B29-34 and ALB/B36-41 had increased proteinase K sensitivity, ubiquitinylation, and increased physical interaction with Sec61alpha. These results indicate that the translocation efficiency of apoB100 is determined mainly by the presence of beta-sheet domains. PTS do not appear to affect translocation, but may affect secretion by other mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective lipid-altering drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial to determine the effects of simvastatin, 80 mg/day, on plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels and on the metabolism of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and LDL and of triglycerides (TGs) in VLDL. Simvastatin therapy decreased TG, cholesterol, and apoB significantly in VLDL, IDL, and LDL. These effects were associated with reduced production of LDL-apoB, mainly as a result of reduced secretion of apoB-lipoproteins directly into the LDL density range. Statin therapy also reduced hepatic production of VLDL-TG. There were no effects of simvastatin on the fractional catabolic rates of VLDL-apoB or -TG or LDL-apoB. The basis for decreased VLDL-TG secretion during simvastatin treatment is not clear, but recent studies suggest that statins may activate peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). Activation of PPARalpha could lead to increased hepatic oxidation of fatty acids and less synthesis of TG for VLDL assembly.",

        "Title": "Regulation of plasma triglycerides in insulin resistance and diabetes.",
        "Abstract": "Increased plasma levels of triglycerides (TG) in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) are not only common characteristics of the dyslipidemia associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but are the central pathophysiologic feature of the abnormal lipid profile. Overproduction of VLDL leads to increased plasma levels of TG which, via an exchange process mediated by cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), results in low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I, and the generation of small, dense, cholesterol ester depleted low density lipoproteins (LDL). Increased assembly and secretion of VLDL by the liver results from the complex, post-transcriptional regulation of apolipoprotein B (apoB) metabolism in the liver. In the presence of low levels of hepatic TG and cholesterol, much of the constitutively synthesized apoB is degraded by both proteasomal and non-proteasomal pathways. When excess TG, and to a lesser extent, cholesterol, are present, and in the presence of active microsomal triglycerides transfer protein, apoB is targeted for secretion. The major sources of TG in the liver: uptake of fatty acids (FA) released by lipolysis of adipose tissue TG, uptake of TGFA in VLDL and chylomicrons remnants, and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (the synthesis of FA from glucose) are all abnormally increased in insulin resistance. Treatment of the dyslipidemia in insulin resistant individuals and patients with T2DM has been successful in reducing cardiovascular disease; LDL cholesterol, TG, and HDL cholesterol are all appropriate targets for therapy when diet, exercise, and weight loss do not achieve goals.",

        "Abstract": "For many years adipose tissue was viewed as the site where excess energy was stored, in the form of triglycerides (TGs), and where that energy, when needed elsewhere in the body, was released in the form of fatty acids (FAs). Recently, it has become clear that when the regulation of the storage and release of energy by adipose tissue is impaired, plasma FA levels become elevated and excessive metabolism of FA, including storage of TGs, occurs in nonadipose tissues. Most recently, work by several laboratories has made it clear that in addition to FA, adipose tissue communicates with the rest of the body by synthesizing and releasing a host of secreted molecules, collectively designated as adipokines. Several recent reviews have described how these molecules, along with FA, significantly effect total body glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Relatively little attention has been paid to the effects of adipokines on lipid metabolism. In this review, we will describe, in detail, the effects of molecules secreted by adipose tissue, including FA, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and apolipoproteins, on lipid homeostasis in several nonadipose tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic beta cells.",

        "Abstract": "Elevated plasma levels of VLDL triglycerides (TGs) are characteristic of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and are associated with increased production rates (PRs) of VLDL TGs and apoB. Lipoprotein lipase-mediated (LPL-mediated) lipolysis of VLDL TGs may also be reduced in T2DM if the level of LPL is decreased and/or the level of plasma apoC-III, an inhibitor of LPL-mediated lipolysis, is increased. We studied the effects of pioglitazone (Pio), a PPARgamma agonist that improves insulin sensitivity, on lipoprotein metabolism in patients with T2DM. Pio treatment reduced TG levels by increasing the fractional clearance rate (FCR) of VLDL TGs from the circulation, without changing direct removal of VLDL particles. This indicated increased lipolysis of VLDL TGs during Pio treatment, a mechanism supported by our finding of increased plasma LPL mass and decreased levels of plasma apoC-III. Lower apoC-III levels were due to reduced apoC-III PRs. We saw no effects of Pio on the PR of either VLDL TG or VLDL apoB. Thus, Pio, a PPARgamma agonist, reduced VLDL TG levels by increasing LPL mass and inhibiting apoC-III PR. These 2 changes were associated with an increased FCR of VLDL TGs, almost certainly due to increased LPL-mediated lipolysis.",

Changes in the expression and/or activity levels of DGAT may lead to changes in systemic insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis. The synthetic role of DGAT in adipose tissue, the liver, and the intestine, sites where endogenous levels of DGAT activity and TG synthesis are high, is relatively clear. Less clear is whether DGAT plays a mediating or preventive role in the development of ectopic lipotoxicity in tissues such as muscle and the pancreas, when their supply of free fatty acids (FFAs) exceeds their needs. Future studies with tissue-specific overexpression and/or knockout in these animal models would be expected to shed additional light on these issues.",

        "Title": "Regulation of hepatic apolipoprotein B-lipoprotein assembly and secretion by the availability of fatty acids. I. Differential response to the delivery of fatty acids via albumin or remnant-like emulsion particles.",
        "Abstract": "The in vivo effects of increased delivery of fatty acids (FA) to the liver are poorly defined. Therefore, we compared the effects of infusing either 6 mM oleic acid (OA) bound to albumin, 0.5-20% Intralipid, or saline for 3 or 6 h into male C57BL/6J mice. Infusions were followed by studies of triglyceride (TG) and apoB secretion. Although plasma FA levels increased similarly after either 20% Intralipid or 6 mM OA, TG secretion increased only after infusion of 4-20% Intralipid; TG secretion was unchanged by 6 mM OA. By contrast, 6-h infusions of either 6 mM OA or 4-20% Intralipid increased apoB secretion. 6 mM OA and 20% Intralipid each increased secretion of apoB from primary hepatocytes ex vivo. Importantly, 0.5-2% Intralipid, which delivered more FA to the liver than 6 mM OA, did not stimulate apoB secretion. Hepatic apoB mRNA levels were unaffected by either 6 mM OA or 20% Intralipid, but microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mRNA was significantly lower after 6-h infusions with 6 mM OA versus either saline or 20% Intralipid. Lower microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mRNA levels were associated with reduced hepatic TG mass after 6-h infusions of 6 mM OA. We conclude that 1) increased FA delivery to the liver in vivo increases secretion of apoB-lipoproteins via post-transcriptional mechanisms, 2) OA-induced apoB-lipoprotein secretion occurred at least in part via mechanisms other than by providing substrate for TG synthesis, and 3) the route of delivery of FA is important for its effects on apoB secretion.",

        "Abstract": "The site where bulk lipid is added to apoB100 low density lipoproteins (LDL)/high density lipoproteins (HDL) particles to form triglyceride-enriched very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) has not been identified definitively. We employed several strategies to address this question. First, McA RH7777 cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased for 1 h (Chase I) to allow study of newly synthesized apoB100 LDL/HDL remaining in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After Chase I, cells were incubated for another hour (C2) with/without brefeldin A (BFA) and nocodazole (Noc) (to block ER to Golgi trafficking) and with/without oleic acid (OA). OA treatment alone during C2 increased VLDL secretion. This was prevented by the addition of BFA/Noc in C2. When C2 media were replaced by control media for another 1-h chase (C3), VLDL formed during OA treatment in C2 were secreted into C3 medium. Thus, OA-induced conversion of apoB100 LDL/HDL to VLDL during C2 occurred in the ER. Next, newly synthesized apoB100 lipoproteins were trapped in the Golgi by treatment with Noc and monensin during Chase I (C1), and C2 was carried out in the presence of BFA/Noc with/without OA and without monensin. Under these conditions, OA treatment during C2 did not stimulate VLDL secretion. The same pulse/chase protocols were followed by iodixanol subcellular fractionation, extraction of lipoproteins from ER and Golgi, and sucrose gradient separation of extracted lipoproteins. Cells treated with BFA/Noc and OA in C2 had VLDL in the ER. In the absence of OA, only LDL/HDL were present in the ER. The density of Golgi lipoproteins in these cells was not affected by OA. Similar results were obtained when ER were immuno-isolated with anti-calnexin antibodies. In conclusion, apoB100 bulk lipidation, resulting in conversion of LDL/HDL to VLDL, can occur in the ER, but not in the Golgi, in McA RH7777 cells.",

        "Abstract": "We studied the role of estrogen in the gender differences in insulin resistance observed in the apoB/BATless mouse, a model of obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. Ovariectomized apoB/BATless mice were more obese and more insulin-resistant than sham ovariectomized apoB/BATless mice. Estrogen replacement by subcutaneous pellet reversed the obesity, lowered plasma insulin levels, and normalized both glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity associated with ovariectomy. The apoB/BATless mouse should be a good model to delineate the molecular mechanisms whereby estrogen protects against insulin resistance.",

        "Abstract": "The metabolic syndrome, or insulin resistance syndrome, is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and related mortality and has an estimated age-adjusted US prevalence of 23.7%. Dyslipidemia in the syndrome is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in the context of normal/slightly elevated LDL cholesterol. Outcomes in treatment studies in or including diabetic patients suggest that a variety of therapies may be of benefit in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with the metabolic syndrome, including physiologic therapies and pharmacologic treatments, such as aspirin, antihypertensive therapy, anti-ischemic therapy, and lipid-modifying therapies. The recently updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines identify the metabolic syndrome as a secondary target of lipid-lowering therapy after LDL cholesterol reduction and recommend use of weight reduction and increased physical activity to address underlying risk factors as well as therapies to address specific lipid and nonlipid risk factors.",

        "Abstract": "Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB) is a large (520-kDa) complex secretory protein; its secretion is regulated posttranscriptionally by several degradation pathways. The best described of these degradative processes is co-translational ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of nascent apoB, involving the 70- and 90-kDa heat shock proteins and the multiple components of the proteasomal pathway. Ubiquitinylation involves several proteins, including ligases called E3s, that coordinate the covalent binding of ubiquitin to target proteins. The recent discovery that tumor autocrine motility factor receptor, also known as gp78, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated E3, raised the possibility that this E3 might be involved in the ER-associated degradation of nascent apoB. In a series of experiments in HepG2 cells, we demonstrated that overexpression of gp78 was sufficient for increased ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of apoB, with reduced secretion of apoB-lipoproteins. This action of gp78 was specific: overexpression of the protein did not affect secretion of either albumin or apolipoprotein AI. Furthermore, overexpression of a cytosolic E3, Itch, had no effect on apoB secretion. Finally, using an in vitro translation system, we demonstrated that gp78 led to increased ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of apoB48. Together, these results indicate that an ER-associated protein, gp78, is a bona fide E3 ligase in the apoB ER-associated degradation pathway.",

        "Title": "The metabolic syndrome: targeting dyslipidaemia to reduce coronary risk.",
        "Abstract": "The metabolic syndrome is a complex constellation of disorders, each one a significant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The increasing prevalence of this condition is a major concern for healthcare providers both in Europe and North America. The concern surrounding the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is reflected in the recently published National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Although complex in nature, the individual components of the metabolic syndrome appear to be linked by the presence of insulin resistance. Concurrently treating the underlying insulin resistance along with the complex array of other disorders should form the core of any management strategy. Treatment of atherogenic dyslipidaemia should be a major aim, since it is associated with a significant risk of CVD. While lifestyle modifications form the cornerstone of any dyslipidaemia management strategy, many patients require the addition of lipid-modifying drugs. Several agents are available for the treatment of lipid abnormalities, including fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, niacin and hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Of these, statins should be used as the first treatment option in the majority of patients because they are efficacious for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are effective across the lipid profile and are well tolerated in the majority of cases. Furthermore, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends statins as first-line pharmacological treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients with diabetes mellitus. This review discusses the diagnosis and management of the metabolic syndrome and examines the potential of future treatment options.",

        "Title": "Posttranscriptional control of the expression and function of diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 in mouse adipocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1) catalyzes the final step of triglyceride synthesis in mammalian cells. Data obtained from DGAT1-knockout mice have indicated that this enzyme plays an important role in energy homeostasis. We investigated the regulation of the expression and function of DGAT1 in mouse 3T3-L1 cell as a model for mammalian adipocytes. We demonstrated that the DGAT1 protein level increased by approximately 90-fold following differentiation of 3T3-L1 into mature adipocytes, a change that was accompanied by approximately 7-fold increase in DGAT1 mRNA. On the other hand, forced overexpression of DGAT1 mRNA by >20-fold via a recombinant adenovirus only resulted in approximately 2-fold increase in DGAT1 protein in mature adipocytes and little increase in preadipocytes. These results indicated that gene expression of DGAT1 in adipocytes is subjected to rigorous posttranscriptional regulation, which is modulated significantly by the differentiation status of 3T3-L1 cells. Protein stability is not a significant factor in the control of DGAT1 expression. The steady-state levels of DGAT1 were unaffected by blockage of proteolytic pathways by ALLN. However, translational control was suggested by sequence analysis of the 5'-untranslated region of human DGAT1 (hDGAT1) mRNA. We found that the level of DGAT1 activity was predominantly a function of the steady-state level of DGAT1 protein. No significant functional changes were observed when the conserved tyrosine phosphorylation site in hDGAT1 was mutated by a single base pair substitution. Despite only a approximately 2-fold increase in DGAT1 protein caused by recombinant viral transduction, a proportionate increase in cellular triglyceride synthesis resulted without affecting the triglyceride lipolysis rate, leading to >2-fold increase in intracellular triglyceride accumulation. No change in adipocyte morphology or in the expression levels of lipoprotein lipase, proxisomal proliferation-activating receptor-gamma, and aP2 was evident secondary to DGAT1 overexpression at different stages in 3T3-L1 differentiation. These data suggest that dysregulation of DGAT1 may play a role in the development of obesity, and manipulation of the steady-state level of DGAT1 protein may offer a potential means to treat or prevent obesity.",

        "Title": "The late addition of core lipids to nascent apolipoprotein B100, resulting in the assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, is independent of both microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity and new triglyceride synthesis.",
        "Abstract": "Although microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and newly synthesized triglyceride (TG) are critical for co-translational targeting of apolipoprotein B (apoB100) to lipoprotein assembly in hepatoma cell lines, their roles in the later stages of lipoprotein assembly remain unclear. Using N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal to prevent proteasomal degradation, HepG2 cells were radiolabeled and chased for 0-90 min (chase I). The medium was changed and cells chased for another 150 min (chase II) in the absence (control) or presence of Pfizer MTP inhibitor CP-10447 (CP). As chase I was extended, inhibition of apoB100 secretion by CP during chase II decreased from 75.9% to only 15% of control (no CP during chase II). Additional studies were conducted in which chase I was either 0 or 90 min, and chase II was in the presence of [(3)H]glycerol and either BSA (control), CP (inhibits both MTP activity and TG synthesis),BMS-1976360-1) (BMS) (inhibits only MTP activity), or triacsin C (TC) (inhibits only TG synthesis). When chase I was 0 min, CP, BMS, and TC reduced apoB100 secretion during chase II by 75.3, 73.9, and 53.9%. However, when chase I was 90 min, those agents reduced apoB100 secretion during chase II by only 16.0, 19.2, and 13.9%. Of note, all three inhibited secretion of newly synthesized TG during chase II by 80, 80, and 40%, whether chase I was 0 or 90 min. In both HepG2 cells and McA-RH7777 cells, if chase I was at least 60 min, inhibition of TG synthesis and/or MTP activity did not affect the density of secreted apoB100-lipoproteins under basal conditions. Oleic acid increased secretion of TG-enriched apoB100-lipoproteins similarly in the absence or presence of either of CP, BMS, or TC. We conclude that neither MTP nor newly synthesized TG is necessary for the later stages of apoB100-lipoprotein assembly and secretion in either HepG2 or McA-RH7777 cells.",
