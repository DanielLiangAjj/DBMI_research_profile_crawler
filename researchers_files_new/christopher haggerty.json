        "Title": "Pyrethroid insecticides pose greater risk than organophosphate insecticides to biocontrol agents for human schistosomiasis.",
        "Abstract": "Use of agrochemicals, including insecticides, is vital to food production and predicted to increase 2-5 fold by 2050. Previous studies have shown a positive association between agriculture and the human infectious disease schistosomiasis, which is problematic as this parasitic disease infects approximately 250 million people worldwide. Certain insecticides might runoff fields and be highly toxic to invertebrates, such as prawns in the genus Macrobrachium, that are biocontrol agents for snails that transmit the parasites causing schistosomiasis. We used a laboratory dose-response experiment and an observational field study to determine the relative toxicities of three pyrethroid (esfenvalerate, Î»-cyhalothrin, and permethrin) and three organophosphate (chlorpyrifos, malathion, and terbufos) insecticides to Macrobrachium prawns. In the lab, pyrethroids were consistently several orders of magnitude more toxic than organophosphate insecticides, and more likely to runoff fields at lethal levels according to modeling data. At 31 water contact sites in the lower basin of the Senegal River where schistosomiasis is endemic, we found that Macrobrachium prawn survival was associated with pyrethroid but not organophosphate application rates to nearby crop fields after controlling for abiotic and prawn-level factors. Our laboratory and field results suggest that widely used pyrethroid insecticides can have strong non-target effects on Macrobrachium prawns that are biocontrol agents where 400 million people are at risk of human schistosomiasis. Understanding the ecotoxicology of high-risk insecticides may help improve human health in schistosomiasis-endemic regions undergoing agricultural expansion.",

        "Abstract": "Use of machine learning (ML) for automated annotation of heart structures from echocardiographic videos is an active research area, but understanding of comparative, generalizable performance among models is lacking. This study aimed to (1) assess the generalizability of five state-of-the-art ML-based echocardiography segmentation models within a large Geisinger clinical dataset, and (2) test the hypothesis that a quality control (QC) method based on segmentation uncertainty can further improve segmentation results. Five models were applied to 47,431 echocardiography studies that were independent from any training samples. Chamber volume and mass from model segmentations were compared to clinically-reported values. The median absolute errors (MAE) in left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction exhibited by all five models were comparable to reported inter-observer errors (IOE). MAE for left atrial volume and LV mass were similarly favorable to respective IOE for models trained for those tasks. A single model consistently exhibited the lowest MAE in all five clinically-reported measures. We leveraged the tenfold cross-validation training scheme of this best-performing model to quantify segmentation uncertainty. We observed that removing segmentations with high uncertainty from 14 to 71% studies reduced volume/mass MAE by 6-10%. The addition of convexity filters improved specificity, efficiently removingâ<â10% studies with large MAE (16-40%). In conclusion, five previously published echocardiography segmentation models generalized to a large, independent clinical dataset-segmenting one or multiple cardiac structures with overall accuracy comparable to manual analyses-with variable performance. Convexity-reinforced uncertainty QC efficiently improved segmentation performance and may further facilitate the translation of such models.",

        "Abstract": "Right ventricular (RV) function is increasingly recognized for its prognostic value in many disease states. As with the left ventricle (LV), strain-based measurements may have better prognostic value than typical chamber volumes or ejection fraction. Complete functional characterization of the RV requires high-resolution, 3D displacement tracking methods, which have been prohibitively challenging to implement. Zonal excitation during Displacement ENcoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has helped reduce scan time for 2D LV strain quantification. We hypothesized that zonal excitation could alternatively be used to reproducibly acquire higher resolution, 3D-encoded DENSE images for quantification of bi-ventricular strain within a single breath-hold.",

        "Abstract": "We propose that geriatric comminuted intra-articular distal humerus fractures can be effectively treated with a limited fixation approach aimed at achieving varus/valgus stability with columnar fixation, but allowing intra-articular comminution to heal by secondary congruency against an intact olecranon, thus avoiding an olecranon osteotomy.",

        "Abstract": "Schistosomiasis is responsible for the second highest burden of disease among neglected tropical diseases globally, with over 90 percent of cases occurring in African regions where drugs to treat the disease are only sporadically available. Additionally, human re-infection after treatment can be a problem where there are high numbers of infected snails in the environment. Recent experiments indicate that aquatic factors, including plants, nutrients, or predators, can influence snail abundance and parasite production within infected snails, both components of human risk. This study investigated how snail host abundance and release of cercariae (the free swimming stage infective to humans) varies at water access sites in an endemic region in Senegal, a setting where human schistosomiasis prevalence is among the highest globally.",

        "Title": "Effects of forestry-driven changes to groundcover and soil moisture on amphibian desiccation, dispersal, and survival.",
        "Abstract": "Over 80% of amphibian species that are declining are forest dependent. Forestry practices are a major cause of forest alterations globally, and it is well documented that clearcutting can contribute to amphibian declines. However, there might be adverse effects of forestry practices other than clearcutting. For example, planting overstory trees in rows (plantations) can change groundcover microhabitats and soil moisture levels, but the effects of this common practice on amphibian populations are not well studied. We compared the impacts of common intensive pine plantation operations to naturally regenerated pine forests on the desiccation, movement rates, behavior, and survival of >900 juvenile southern toads (Anaxyrus terrestris). Pine plantations had significantly more accumulation of conifer needles and less exposed soil, herbaceous groundcover, broadleaf litter, and soil moisture than natural pine forests despite the greater canopy cover at plantations. Litter cover explained 85% of groundcover microhabitat variance among forest types and predicted minimum soil moisture levels. When toads were held in small outdoor enclosures that constrained microhabitat selection, 24-h desiccation rates and 72-h mortality were significantly greater in pine plantation than in naturally regenerated pine forest because of lower soil moisture, especially during low rainfall periods. In large outdoor pens where juvenile amphibians could select microhabitats, movement was strongly directed down slope and increased with precipitation. However, initial speeds were positively associated with pine density, likely because toads were trying to evacuate from the drier high-pine-density areas. High-intensity silviculture practices that eliminate herbaceous or vegetative groundcover, such as roller chopping and scalping, increase amphibian desiccation because planted conifers dry the upper soil layer. Our study highlights the importance of prioritizing lower intensity silviculture practices or lower pine densities to retain groundcover microhabitat that serves as amphibian refugia from dry conditions that are predicted to increase in frequency with climate change.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) feature tracking is increasingly used to quantify cardiac mechanics from cine CMR imaging, although validation against reference standard techniques has been limited. Furthermore, studies have suggested that commonly-derived metrics, such as peak global strain (reported in 63% of feature tracking studies), can be quantified using contours from just two frames - end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) - without requiring tracking software. We hypothesized that mechanics derived from feature tracking would not agree with those derived from a reference standard (displacement-encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) imaging), and that peak strain from feature tracking would agree with that derived using simple processing of only ED and ES contours.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) have progressive, adverse biventricular remodeling, leading to abnormal contractile mechanics. Defining the mechanisms underlying this dysfunction, such as diffuse myocardial fibrosis, may provide insights into poor long-term outcomes. We hypothesized that left ventricular (LV) diffuse fibrosis is related to impaired LV mechanics.",

        "Abstract": "PurposeArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart disease. Clinical follow-up of incidental findings in ARVC-associated genes is recommended. We aimed to determine the prevalence of disease thus ascertained.MethodsIndividuals (nÂ =Â 30,716) underwent exome sequencing. Variants in PKP2, DSG2, DSC2, DSP, JUP, TMEM43, or TGFÎ²3 that were database-listed as pathogenic or likely pathogenic were identified and evidence-reviewed. For subjects with putative loss-of-function (pLOF) variants or variants of uncertain significance (VUS), electronic health records (EHR) were reviewed for ARVC diagnosis, diagnostic criteria, and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes.ResultsEighteen subjects had pLOF variants; none of these had an EHR diagnosis of ARVC. Of 14 patients with an electrocardiogram, one had a minor diagnostic criterion; the rest were normal. A total of 184 subjects had VUS, none of whom had an ARVC diagnosis. The proportion of subjects with VUS with major (4%) or minor (13%) electrocardiogram diagnostic criteria did not differ from that of variant-negative controls. ICD-9 codes showed no difference in defibrillator use, electrophysiologic abnormalities or nonischemic cardiomyopathies in patients with pLOF or VUSs compared with controls.ConclusionpLOF variants in an unselected cohort were not associated with ARVC phenotypes based on EHR review. The negative predictive value of EHR review remains uncertain.",

The tradeoff of navigator gating is reduced scan efficiency, particularly when the patient's breathing patterns are inconsistent, as is commonly seen in children.

This modification of the Fontan procedure seeks to improve hepatic flow distribution (HFD) to the lungs. However, patient-specific anatomical restrictions might limit the space available for graft placement. Altering the superior vena cava (SVC) positioning is hypothesized to provide more space for an optimal connection, avoiding caval flow collision. Computational modeling tools were used to retrospectively study the effect of SVC placement on Y-graft hemodynamics.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. There is evidence of impaired left ventricular (LV) function associated with obesity, which may relate to cardiovascular mortality, but some studies have reported no dysfunction. Ventricular function data are generally acquired under resting conditions, which could mask subtle differences and potentially contribute to these contradictory findings. Furthermore, abnormal ventricular mechanics (strains, strain rates, and torsion) may manifest prior to global changes in cardiac function (i.e., ejection fraction) and may therefore represent more sensitive markers of cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated LV mechanics under both resting and stress conditions with the hypothesis that the LV mechanical dysfunction associated with obesity is exacerbated with stress and manifested at earlier stages of disease compared to baseline.",

        "Title": "Telemetric Blood Pressure Assessment in Angiotensin II-Infused ApoE-/- Mice: 28 Day Natural History and Comparison to Tail-Cuff Measurements.",
        "Abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a disease of the aortic wall, which can progress to catastrophic rupture. Assessment of mechanical characteristics of AAA, such as aortic distensibility, may provide important insights to help identify at-risk patients and understand disease progression. While the majority of studies on this topic have focused on retrospective patient data, recent studies have used mouse models of AAA to prospectively evaluate the evolution of aortic mechanics. Quantification of aortic distensibility requires accurate measurement of arterial blood pressure, particularly pulse pressure, which is challenging to perform accurately in murine models. We hypothesized that volume/pressure tail-cuff measurements of arterial pulse pressure in anesthetized mice would have sufficient accuracy to enable calculations of aortic distensibility with minimal error. Telemetry devices and osmotic mini-pumps filled with saline or angiotensin-II were surgically implanted in male apolipoprotein-E deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. Blood pressure in the aortic arch was measured continuously via telemetry. In addition, simultaneous blood pressure measurements with a volume/pressure tail-cuff system were performed under anesthesia at specific intervals to assess agreement between techniques. Compared to controls, mice infused with angiotensin-II had an overall statistically significant increase in systolic pressure, with no overall difference in pulse pressure; however, pulse pressure did increase significantly with time. Systolic measurements agreed well between telemetry and tail-cuff (coefficient of variation = 10%), but agreement of pulse pressure was weak (20%). In fact, group-averaged pulse pressure from telemetry was a better predictor of a subject's pulse pressure on a given day than a simultaneous tail-cuff measurement. Furthermore, these approximations introduced acceptable errors (15.1 Â± 12.8%) into the calculation of aortic distensibility. Contrary to our hypothesis, we conclude that tail-cuff measures of arterial pulse pressure have limited accuracy. Future studies of aneurysm mechanics using the ApoE(-/-)/angiotensin-II model would be better in assuming pulse pressure profiles consistent with our telemetry findings instead of attempting to measure pulse pressure in individual mice.",

Due to the stimulated echo, the signal is inherently low and fades through the cardiac cycle. To compensate, a spiral acquisition has been used at 1.5T. This spiral sequence has not been validated at 3T, where the increased signal would be valuable, but field inhomogeneities may result in measurement errors. We hypothesized that spiral cine DENSE is valid at 3T and tested this hypothesis by measuring displacement errors at both 1.5T and 3T in vivo.",

A potential hurdle to widespread clinical adoption of DENSE is the time required to manually segment the myocardium during post-processing of the images. To overcome this hurdle, we proposed a radical approach in which only three contours per image slice are required for post-processing (instead of the typical 30-40 contours per image slice). We hypothesized that peak left ventricular circumferential, longitudinal and radial strains and torsion could be accurately quantified using this simplified analysis.",

Geometric features, such as diameter, connection angle, and distance between vessels, are hypothesized to affect the energetics and flow dynamics within the connection. This study aimed to identify important geometric characteristics that can influence TCPC hemodynamics. Anatomies from 108 consecutive patients were reconstructed from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images and analyzed for their geometric features. Vessel flow rates were computed from phase contrast CMR. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were carried out to quantify the indexed power loss and hepatic flow distribution. TCPC indexed power loss correlated inversely with minimum Fontan pathway (FP), left pulmonary artery, and right pulmonary artery diameters. Cardiac index correlated with minimum FP diameter and superior vena cava (SVC) minimum/maximum diameter ratio. Hepatic flow distribution correlated with caval offset, pulmonary flow distribution, and the angle between FP and SVC. These correlations can have important implications for future connection design and patient follow-up.",

        "Abstract": "The Fontan procedure, although an imperfect solution for children born with a single functional ventricle, is the only reconstruction at present short of transplantation. The haemodynamics associated with the total cavopulmonary connection, the modern approach to Fontan, are severely altered from the normal biventricular circulation and may contribute to the long-term complications that are frequently noted. Through recent technological advances, spear-headed by advances in medical imaging, it is now possible to virtually model these surgical procedures and evaluate the patient-specific haemodynamics as part of the pre-operative planning process. This is a novel paradigm with the potential to revolutionise the approach to Fontan surgery, help to optimise the haemodynamic results, and improve patient outcomes. This review provides a brief overview of these methods, presents preliminary results of their clinical usage, and offers insights into its potential future directions.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity affects a third of adults in the US and results in an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. While the mechanisms underlying this increased risk are not well understood, animal models of obesity have shown direct effects on the heart such as steatosis and fibrosis, which may affect cardiac function. However, the effect of obesity on cardiac function in animal models is not well-defined. We hypothesized that diet-induced obesity in mice reduces strain, torsion, and synchrony in the left ventricle (LV).",

        "Abstract": "Complete dislocation of the globe, inferiorly into the maxillary sinus, medially into the ethmoid sinus, or superiorly into the anterior cranial fossa, can occur with significant blunt facial trauma. The degree of injury to the globe, its adnexal structures, and the optic nerve is dependent on the extent of the dislocation. Complete traumatic subluxation of the globe into the maxillary sinus is associated with severe injury to the periocular structures and represents a challenging and unique reconstructive process rarely encountered in published studies. The present case report represents only the 15th reported case of complete orbital prolapse into the maxillary sinus. Controversy exists regarding the definitive treatment of traumatic globe dislocations, the risk of sympathetic ophthalmia (SO), the sequela of postenucleation socket syndrome, and prophylactic steroid treatment to decrease the incidence of SO and traumatic optic neuropathy.",

Cine DENSE cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is ideal for quantifying advanced measures of cardiac function based on its high spatial resolution and streamlined post-processing. While many studies have utilized cine DENSE in both humans and small-animal models, the inter-test and inter-observer reproducibility for quantification of advanced cardiac function in mice has not been evaluated. This represents a critical knowledge gap for both understanding the capabilities of this technique and for the design of future experiments.

        "Abstract": "The total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC), the current palliation of choice for single-ventricle heart defects, is typically created with a single cylindrical tunnel or conduit routing inferior vena caval (IVC) flow to the pulmonary arteries. Previous studies have shown the haemodynamic efficiency of the TCPC to be sub-optimal due to the collision of vena caval flow, thus placing an extra energy burden on the single ventricle. The use of a bifurcated graft as the Fontan baffle (i.e. the 'Optiflo') has previously been proposed on the basis of theoretically improved flow efficiency; however, anatomical constraints may limit its effectiveness in some patients.",

        "Abstract": "The hemodynamics in patients with total cavopulmonary connections (TCPC) is generally very complex and characterized by patient-to-patient variability. To better understand its effect on patients' outcome, CFD models are widely used, also to test and optimize surgical options before their implementation. These models often assume rigid geometries, despite the motion experienced by thoracic vessels that could influence the hemodynamics predictions. By improving their accuracy and expanding the range of simulated interventions, the benefit of treatment planning for patients is expected to increase. We simulate three types of intervention on a patient-specific 3D model, and compare their predicted outcome with baseline condition: a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance obtainable with medications; a surgical revision of the connection design; the introduction of a fenestration in the TCPC wall. The simulations are performed both with rigid wall assumption and including patient-specific TCPC wall motion, reconstructed from a 4DMRI dataset. The results show the effect of each option on clinically important metrics and highlight the impact of patient-specific wall motion. The largest differences between rigid and moving wall models are observed in measures of energetic efficiency of TCPC as well as in hepatic flow distribution and transit time of seeded particles through the connection.",

        "Abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools have been extensively applied to study the hemodynamics in the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) in patients with only a single functioning ventricle. Without the contraction of a sub-pulmonary ventricle, pulsatility of flow through this connection is low and variable across patients, which is usually neglected in most numerical modeling studies. Recent studies suggest that such pulsatility can be non-negligible and can be important in hemodynamic predictions. The goal of this work is to compare the results of an in-house numerical methodology for simulating pulsatile TCPC flow with experimental results. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) was acquired on TCPC in vitro models to evaluate the capability of the CFD tool in predicting pulsatile TCPC flow fields. In vitro hemodynamic measurements were used to compare the numerical prediction of power loss across the connection. The results demonstrated the complexity of the pulsatile TCPC flow fields and the validity of the numerical approach in simulating pulsatile TCPC flow dynamics in both idealized and complex patient specific models.",

        "Abstract": "Virtual modeling of cardiothoracic surgery is a new paradigm that allows for systematic exploration of various operative strategies and uses engineering principles to predict the optimal patient-specific plan. This study investigates the predictive accuracy of such methods for the surgical palliation of single ventricle heart defects. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based surgical planning was used to model the Fontan procedure for four patients prior to surgery. The objective for each was to identify the operative strategy that best distributed hepatic blood flow to the pulmonary arteries. Post-operative magnetic resonance data were acquired to compare (via CFD) the post-operative hemodynamics with predictions. Despite variations in physiologic boundary conditions (e.g., cardiac output, venous flows) and the exact geometry of the surgical baffle, sufficient agreement was observed with respect to hepatic flow distribution (90% confidence interval-14Â Â±Â 4.3% difference). There was also good agreement of flow-normalized energetic efficiency predictions (19Â Â±Â 4.8% error). The hemodynamic outcomes of prospective patient-specific surgical planning of the Fontan procedure are described for the first time with good quantitative comparisons between preoperatively predicted and postoperative simulations. These results demonstrate that surgical planning can be a useful tool for single ventricle cardiothoracic surgery with the ability to deliver significant clinical impact.",

        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Late morbidity of surgically repaired coarctation of the aorta includes early cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, shortened life expectancy, abnormal vasomodulator response, hypertension and exercise-induced hypertension in the absence of recurrent coarctation. Observational studies have linked patterns of arch remodeling (Gothic, Crenel, and Romanesque) to late morbidity, with Gothic arches having the highest incidence. We evaluated flow in native and surgically repaired aortic arches to correlate respective hemodynamic indices with incidence of late morbidity. METHODS: Three dimensional reconstructions of each remodeled arch were created from an anatomic stack of magnetic resonance (MR) images. A structured mesh core with a boundary layer was generated. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis was performed assuming peak flow conditions with a uniform velocity profile and unsteady turbulent flow. Wall shear stress (WSS), pressure and velocity data were extracted. RESULTS: The region of maximum WSS was located in the mid-transverse arch for the Crenel, Romanesque and Native arches. Peak WSS was located in the isthmus of the Gothic model. Variations in descending aorta flow patterns were also observed among the models. CONCLUSION: The location of peak WSS is a primary difference among the models tested, and may have clinical relevance. Specifically, the Gothic arch had a unique location of peak WSS with flow disorganization in the descending aorta. Our results suggest that varied patterns and locations of WSS resulting from abnormal arch remodeling may exhibit a primary effect on clinical vascular dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "This study examined the interactive fluid dynamics between a cavopulmonary assist device and univentricular Fontan circulation. We conducted two-dimensional particle image velocimetry measurements on an idealized total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) with an axial pump prototype intravascularly inserted into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and then in the IVC and the superior vena cava (SVC) for a dual-pump support case. The glass model of the TCPC consisted of rigid vessels having a diameter of 13.4 mm and a one-diameter vessel offset at the TCPC junction. Fluid velocity profiles were examined at a cardiac output of 3 L/min and SVC and IVC flow ratios of 30/70%, 40/60%, and 50/50% and pump rotational speeds from 3000 to 9000 rpm. In addition, cardiac outputs of 5 and 7 L/min were also examined. As compared to the flow profile with the pump present, the measured velocity field demonstrated the presence of rotational (i.e., out of plane) motion, which forced the higher-velocity regions toward the periphery of the vessel. As a result, few flow vortices were captured in the image plane downstream of the pump in the TCPC junction. However, the velocity profiles for all cases demonstrated the expected shunting preference of IVC flow toward the right pulmonary artery. Furthermore, the inclusion of the pump provided a pressure rise of 3 to 9 mm Hg, which would be sufficient to relieve systemic hypertension in Fontan patients with circulatory dysfunction.",
