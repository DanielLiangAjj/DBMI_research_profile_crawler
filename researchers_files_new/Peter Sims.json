        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly brain tumor, and the kinesin motor KIF11 is an attractive therapeutic target with roles in proliferation and invasion. Resistance to KIF11 inhibitors, which has mainly been studied in animal models, presents significant challenges. We use lineage-tracing barcodes and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze resistance in patient-derived GBM neurospheres treated with ispinesib, a potent KIF11 inhibitor. Similar to GBM progression in patients, untreated cells lose their neural lineage identity and become mesenchymal, which is associated with poor prognosis. Conversely, cells subjected to long-term ispinesib treatment exhibit a proneural phenotype. We generate patient-derived xenografts and show that ispinesib-resistant cells form less aggressive tumors in vivo, even in the absence of drug. Moreover, treatment of human ex vivo GBM slices with ispinesib demonstrates phenotypic alignment with in vitro responses, underscoring the clinical relevance of our findings. Finally, using retrospective lineage tracing, we identify drugs that are synergistic with ispinesib.",

        "Abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic analyses now frequently involve elaborate study designs including samples from multiple individuals, experimental conditions, perturbations, and batches from complex tissues. Dimensionality reduction is required to facilitate integration, interpretation, and statistical analysis. However, these datasets often include subtly different cellular subpopulations or state transitions, which are poorly described by clustering. We previously reported a Bayesian matrix factorization algorithm called single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF) that identifies gene co-expression patterns directly from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) count matrices while accounting for transcript drop-out and noise. Here, we describe consensus scHPF, which analyzes scHPF models from multiple random initializations to identify the most robust gene signatures and automatically determine the number of factors for a given dataset. Consensus scHPF facilitates integration of complex datasets with highly multi-modal posterior distributions, resulting in factors that can be uniformly analyzed across individuals and conditions. To demonstrate the utility of consensus scHPF, we performed a meta-analysis of a large-scale scRNA-seq dataset from drug-treated, human glioma slice cultures generated from surgical specimens across three major cell types, 19 patients, 10 drug treatment conditions, and 52 samples. In addition to recapitulating previously reported cell type-specific drug responses from smaller studies, consensus scHPF identified disparate effects of the topoisomerase poisons etoposide and topotecan that are highly consistent with the distinct roles and expression patterns of their respective protein targets.",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor, and resection is a key part of the standard of care. In fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), fluorophores differentiate tumor tissue from surrounding normal brain. The heme synthesis pathway converts 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a fluorogenic substrate used for FGS, to fluorescent protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The resulting fluorescence is believed to be specific to neoplastic glioma cells, but this specificity has not been examined at a single-cell level. The objective of this study was to determine the specificity with which 5-ALA labels the diversity of cell types in GBM.",

        "Abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is invaluable for profiling cellular heterogeneity and dissecting transcriptional states, but transcriptomic profiles do not always delineate subsets defined by surface proteins, as in cells of the immune system. Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes (CITE-seq) enables simultaneous profiling of single-cell transcriptomes and surface proteomes; however, accurate cell type annotation requires a classifier that integrates multimodal data. Here, we describe MultiModal Classifier Hierarchy (MMoCHi), a marker-based approach for classification, reconciling gene and protein expression without reliance on reference atlases. We benchmark MMoCHi using sorted T lymphocyte subsets and annotate a cross-tissue human immune cell dataset. MMoCHi outperforms leading transcriptome-based classifiers and multimodal unsupervised clustering in its ability to identify immune cell subsets that are not readily resolved and to reveal novel subset markers. MMoCHi is designed for adaptability and can integrate annotation of cell types and developmental states across diverse lineages, samples, or modalities.",

However, existing tools lack the throughput required for comprehensive analysis of complex tumors and tissues. We introduce a highly scalable method for jointly profiling DNA and expression following nucleosome depletion (DEFND-seq). In DEFND-seq, nuclei are nucleosome-depleted, tagmented, and separated into individual droplets for mRNA and genomic DNA barcoding. Once nuclei have been depleted of nucleosomes, subsequent steps can be performed using the widely available 10x Genomics droplet microfluidic technology and commercial kits without experimental modification. We demonstrate the production of high-complexity mRNA and gDNA sequencing libraries from thousands of individual nuclei from both cell lines and archived surgical specimens for associating gene expression phenotypes with both copy number and single nucleotide variants.",

        "Abstract": "Protein synthesis is dysregulated in many diseases, but we lack a systems-level picture of how signaling molecules and RNA binding proteins interact with the translational machinery, largely due to technological limitations. Here we present riboPLATE-seq, a scalable method for generating paired libraries of ribosome-associated and total mRNA. As an extension of the PLATE-seq protocol, riboPLATE-seq utilizes barcoded primers for pooled library preparation, but additionally leverages anti-rRNA ribosome immunoprecipitation on whole polysomes to measure ribosome association (RA). We compare RA to its analogue in ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing, translation efficiency, and demonstrate both the performance of riboPLATE-seq and its utility in detecting translational alterations induced by specific inhibitors of protein kinases.",

        "Abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons modulate neural circuits and behaviors via dopamine (DA) release from expansive, long range axonal projections. The elaborate cytoarchitecture of these neurons is embedded within complex brain tissue, making it difficult to access the neuronal proteome using conventional methods. Here, we demonstrate APEX2 proximity labeling within genetically targeted neurons in the mouse brain, enabling subcellular proteomics with cell-type specificity. By combining APEX2 biotinylation with mass spectrometry, we mapped the somatodendritic and axonal proteomes of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Our dataset reveals the proteomic architecture underlying proteostasis, axonal metabolism, and neurotransmission in these neurons. We find that most proteins encoded by DA neuron-enriched genes are localized within striatal dopaminergic axons, including ion channels with previously undescribed axonal localization. These proteomic datasets provide a resource for neuronal cell biology, and this approach can be readily adapted for study of other neural cell types.",

        "Abstract": "Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons exhibit extensive dendritic and axonal arborizations, but local protein synthesis is not characterized in these neurons. Here, we investigate messenger RNA (mRNA) localization and translation in mDA neuronal axons and dendrites, both of which release dopamine (DA). Using highly sensitive ribosome-bound RNA sequencing and imaging approaches, we find no evidence for mRNA translation in mDA axons. In contrast, mDA neuronal dendrites in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) contain ribosomes and mRNAs encoding the major components of DA synthesis, release, and reuptake machinery. Surprisingly, we also observe dendritic localization of mRNAs encoding synaptic vesicle-related proteins, including those involved in exocytic fusion. Our results are consistent with a role for local translation in the regulation of DA release from dendrites, but not from axons. Our translatome data define a molecular signature of sparse mDA neurons in the SNr, including the enrichment of Atp2a3/SERCA3, an atypical ER calcium pump.",

However, existing methods for linking microscopy and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) have limited scalability. Here, we describe an upgraded version of Single Cell Optical Phenotyping and Expression (SCOPE-seq2) for combining single-cell imaging and expression profiling, with substantial improvements in throughput, molecular capture efficiency, linking accuracy, and compatibility with standard microscopy instrumentation. We introduce improved optically decodable mRNA capture beads and implement a more scalable and simplified optical decoding process. We demonstrate the utility of SCOPE-seq2 for fluorescence, morphological, and expression profiling of individual primary cells from a human glioblastoma (GBM) surgical sample, revealing relationships between simple imaging features and cellular identity, particularly among malignantly transformed tumor cells.",

        "Title": "Elongation inhibitors do not prevent the release of puromycylated nascent polypeptide chains from ribosomes.",
        "Abstract": "Puromycin is an amino-acyl transfer RNA analog widely employed in studies of protein synthesis. Since puromycin is covalently incorporated into nascent polypeptide chains, anti-puromycin immunofluorescence enables visualization of nascent protein synthesis. A common assumption in studies of local messenger RNA translation is that the anti-puromycin staining of puromycylated nascent polypeptides in fixed cells accurately reports on their original site of translation, particularly when ribosomes are stalled with elongation inhibitors prior to puromycin treatment. However, when we attempted to implement a proximity ligation assay to detect ribosome-puromycin complexes, we found no evidence to support this assumption. We further demonstrated, using biochemical assays and live cell imaging of nascent polypeptides in mammalian cells, that puromycylated nascent polypeptides rapidly dissociate from ribosomes even in the presence of elongation inhibitors. Our results suggest that attempts to define precise subcellular translation sites using anti-puromycin immunostaining may be confounded by release of puromycylated nascent polypeptide chains prior to fixation.",

        "Abstract": "In the adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new olfactory bulb (OB) neurons and glia throughout life. To map adult neuronal lineage progression, we profiled >56,000 V-SVZ and OB cells by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal the molecular diversity of OB neurons, including fate-mapped neurons, lineage progression dynamics, and an NSC intermediate enriched for Notum, which encodes a secreted WNT antagonist. SCOPE-seq technology, which links live-cell imaging with scRNA-seq, uncovers cell-size transitions during NSC differentiation and preferential NOTUM binding to proliferating neuronal precursors. Consistently, application of NOTUM protein in slice cultures and pharmacological inhibition of NOTUM in slice cultures and in vivo demonstrated that NOTUM negatively regulates V-SVZ proliferation. Timely, context-dependent neurogenesis demands adaptive signaling among neighboring progenitors. Our findings highlight a critical regulatory state during NSC activation marked by NOTUM, which attenuates WNT-stimulated proliferation in NSC progeny.",

        "Abstract": "Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated sorting are powerful techniques that hold great promise for studying heterogeneous populations of submicron particles such as synaptosomes, but many technical challenges arise in these experiments. To date, most flow cytometry studies of synaptosomes have relied on particle detection using forward scatter (FSC) measurements and size estimation with polystyrene (PS) bead standards. However, these practices have serious limitations, and special care must be taken to overcome the poor sensitivity of conventional flow cytometers in the analysis of submicron particles. Technical artifacts can confound these experiments, especially the detection of multiple particles as a single event. Here, we compared analysis of P2 crude synaptosomal preparations from murine forebrain on multiple flow cytometers using both FSC-triggered and fluorescence-triggered detection. We implemented multicolor fluorescent dye-based assays to quantify coincident particle detection and aggregation, and we assessed the false colocalization of antigens in immunostaining analyses. Our results demonstrate that fluorescence triggering and proper dilution can control for coincident particle detection, but not particle aggregation. We confirmed previous studies showing that FSC-based size estimation with PS beads underestimates biological particle size, and we identified pervasive aggregation in the FSC range analyzed in most synaptosome flow cytometry studies. We found that analyzing P2 samples in sucrose/EDTA/tris (SET) buffer reduces aggregation compared to PBS, but does not completely eliminate the presence of aggregates, especially in immunostaining experiments. Our study highlights challenges and pitfalls in synaptosome flow cytometry and provides a methodological framework for future studies.",

Increasing evidence suggests that FMRP regulates both translation initiation and elongation, but the gene specificity of these effects is unclear. To elucidate the impact of Fmr1 loss on translation, we utilize ribosome profiling for genome-wide measurements of ribosomal occupancy and positioning in the cortex of 24-day-old Fmr1 knockout mice. We find a remarkably coherent reduction in ribosome footprint abundance per mRNA for previously identified, high-affinity mRNA binding partners of FMRP and an increase for terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif-containing genes canonically controlled by mammalian target of rapamycin-eIF4E-binding protein-eIF4E binding protein-eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (mTOR-4E-BP-eIF4E) signaling. Amino acid motif- and gene-level analyses both show a widespread reduction of translational pausing in Fmr1 knockout mice. Our findings are consistent with a model of FMRP-mediated regulation of both translation initiation through eIF4E and elongation that is disrupted in fragile X syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Pharmacological and functional genomic screens play an essential role in the discovery and characterization of therapeutic targets and associated pharmacological inhibitors. Although these screens affect thousands of gene products, the typical readout is based on low complexity rather than genome-wide assays. To address this limitation, we introduce pooled library amplification for transcriptome expression (PLATE-Seq), a low-cost, genome-wide mRNA profiling methodology specifically designed to complement high-throughput screening assays. Introduction of sample-specific barcodes during reverse transcription supports pooled library construction and low-depth sequencing that is 10- to 20-fold less expensive than conventional RNA-Seq. The use of network-based algorithms to infer protein activity from PLATE-Seq data results in comparable reproducibility to 30 M read sequencing. Indeed, PLATE-Seq reproducibility compares favorably to other large-scale perturbational profiling studies such as the connectivity map and library of integrated network-based cellular signatures.Despite the importance of pharmacological and functional genomic screens the readouts are of low complexity. Here the authors introduce PLATE-Seq, a low-cost genome-wide mRNA profiling method to complement high-throughput screening.",

        "Abstract": "Recent developments have enabled rapid, inexpensive RNA sequencing of thousands of individual cells from a single specimen, raising the possibility of unbiased and comprehensive expression profiling from complex tissues. Microwell arrays are a particularly attractive microfluidic platform for single cell analysis due to their scalability, cell capture efficiency, and compatibility with imaging. We report an automated microwell array platform for single cell RNA-Seq with significantly improved performance over previous implementations. We demonstrate cell capture efficiencies of >50%, compatibility with commercially available barcoded mRNA capture beads, and parallel expression profiling from thousands of individual cells. We evaluate the level of cross-contamination in our platform by both tracking fluorescent cell lysate in sealed microwells and with a human-mouse mixed species RNA-Seq experiment. Finally, we apply our system to comprehensively assess heterogeneity in gene expression of patient-derived glioma neurospheres and uncover subpopulations similar to those observed in human glioma tissue.",

        "Abstract": "Glioma growth is driven by signaling that ultimately regulates protein synthesis. Gliomas are also complex at the cellular level and involve multiple cell types, including transformed and reactive cells in the brain tumor microenvironment. The distinct functions of the various cell types likely lead to different requirements and regulatory paradigms for protein synthesis. Proneural gliomas can arise from transformation of glial progenitors that are driven to proliferate via mitogenic signaling that affects translation. To investigate translational regulation in this system, we developed a RiboTag glioma mouse model that enables cell-type-specific, genome-wide ribosome profiling of tumor tissue. Infecting glial progenitors with Cre-recombinant retrovirus simultaneously activates expression of tagged ribosomes and delivers a tumor-initiating mutation. Remarkably, we find that although genes specific to transformed cells are highly translated, their translation efficiencies are low compared with normal brain. Ribosome positioning reveals sequence-dependent regulation of ribosomal activity in 5'-leaders upstream of annotated start codons, leading to differential translation in glioma compared with normal brain. Additionally, although transformed cells express a proneural signature, untransformed tumor-associated cells, including reactive astrocytes and microglia, express a mesenchymal signature. Finally, we observe the same phenomena in human disease by combining ribosome profiling of human proneural tumor and non-neoplastic brain tissue with computational deconvolution to assess cell-type-specific translational regulation.",

Here we introduce chemical methods for the rapid quantification of a wide range of chemical and microbial contaminations using a simple instrument. Within the testing procedure, we used a multichannel, multisample, UV-vis spectrophotometer/fluorometer that employs two frequencies of light simultaneously to interrogate the sample. We present new enzyme- and dye-based methods to detect (di)ethylene glycol in consumables above 0.1 wt % without interference and alcohols above 1 ppb. Using DNA intercalating dyes, we can detect a range of pathogens ( E. coli , Salmonella , V. Cholera, and a model for Malaria) in water, foods, and blood without background signal. We achieved universal scaling independent of pathogen size above 10(4) CFU/mL by taking advantage of the simultaneous measurement at multiple wavelengths. We can detect contaminants directly, without separation, purification, concentration, or incubation. Our chemistry is stable to ± 1% for >3 weeks without refrigeration, and measurements require <5 min.",

        "Abstract": "RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful tool for transcriptome profiling, but is hampered by sequence-dependent bias and inaccuracy at low copy numbers intrinsic to exponential PCR amplification. We developed a simple strategy for mitigating these complications, allowing truly digital RNA-Seq. Following reverse transcription, a large set of barcode sequences is added in excess, and nearly every cDNA molecule is uniquely labeled by random attachment of barcode sequences to both ends. After PCR, we applied paired-end deep sequencing to read the two barcodes and cDNA sequences. Rather than counting the number of reads, RNA abundance is measured based on the number of unique barcode sequences observed for a given cDNA sequence. We optimized the barcodes to be unambiguously identifiable, even in the presence of multiple sequencing errors. This method allows counting with single-copy resolution despite sequence-dependent bias and PCR-amplification noise, and is analogous to digital PCR but amendable to quantifying a whole transcriptome. We demonstrated transcriptome profiling of Escherichia coli with more accurate and reproducible quantification than conventional RNA-Seq.",

        "Abstract": "Importin α1 can bind classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in two NLS-binding sites, known as \"major\" and \"minor.\" The major site is located between ARM repeats 2-4, whereas the minor site spans ARM 7-8. In this study, we have characterized the cellular localization of human phospholipid scramblase 4 (hPLSCR4), a member of the phospholipid scramblase protein family. We identified a minimal NLS in hPLSCR4 ((273)GSIIRKWN(280)) that contains only two basic amino acids. This NLS is both necessary for nuclear localization of hPLSCR4 in transfected HeLa cells and sufficient for nuclear import of a non-diffusible cargo in permeabilized cells. Mutation of only one of the two basic residues, Arg(277), correlates with loss of nuclear localization, suggesting this amino acid plays a key role in nuclear transport. Crystallographic analysis of mammalian importin α1 in complex with the hPLSCR4-NLS reveals this minimal NLS binds specifically and exclusively to the minor binding site of importin α. These data provide the first structural and functional evidence of a novel NLS-binding mode in importin α1 that uses only the minor groove as the exclusive site for nuclear import of nonclassical cargos.",

        "Abstract": "We developed a multiplex sequencing-by-synthesis method combining terminal phosphate-labeled fluorogenic nucleotides (TPLFNs) and resealable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microreactors. In the presence of phosphatase, primer extension by DNA polymerase using nonfluorescent TPLFNs generates fluorophores, which are confined in the microreactors and detected. We immobilized primed DNA templates in the microreactors, then sequentially introduced one of the four identically labeled TPLFNs, sealed the microreactors and recorded a fluorescence image after template-directed primer extension. With cycle times of <10 min, we demonstrate 30 base reads with ∼99% raw accuracy. Our 'fluorogenic pyrosequencing' offers benefits of pyrosequencing, such as rapid turnaround, one-color detection and generation of native DNA, along with high detection sensitivity and simplicity of parallelization because simultaneous real-time monitoring of all microreactors is not required.",

        "Abstract": "PLSCR1-/- mice exhibit normal, steady-state hematologic parameters but impaired emergency granulopoiesis upon in vivo administration of G-CSF. The mechanism by which PLSCR1 contributes to G-CSF-induced neutrophil production is largely unknown. We now report that the expansion of bone marrow myelocytes upon in vivo G-CSF treatment is reduced in PLSCR1-/- mice relative to WT. Using SCF-ER-Hoxb8-immortalized myeloid progenitors to examine the progression of G-CSF-driven granulocytic differentiation in vitro, we found that PLSCR1 prolongs the period of mitotic expansion of proliferative granulocyte precursors, thereby giving rise to increased neutrophil production from their progenitors. This effect of PLSCR1 is blocked by a ΔNLS-PLSCR1, which prevents its nuclear import. By contrast, mutation that prevents the membrane association of PLSCR1 has minimal impact on the role of PLSCR1 in G-CSF-induced granulopoiesis. These data imply that the capacity of PLSCR1 to augment G-CSF-dependent production of mature neutrophils from myeloid progenitors is unrelated to its reported activities at the endofacial surface of the plasma membrane but does require entry of the protein into the nucleus, suggesting that this response is mediated through the observed effects of PLSCR1 on gene transcription.",

        "Title": "Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.",
        "Abstract": "In all animal cells, phospholipids are asymmetrically distributed between the outer and inner leaflets of the plasma membrane. This asymmetrical phospholipid distribution is disrupted in various biological systems. For example, when blood platelets are activated, they expose phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) to trigger the clotting system. The PtdSer exposure is believed to be mediated by Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid scramblases that transport phospholipids bidirectionally, but its molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here we show that TMEM16F (transmembrane protein 16F) is an essential component for the Ca(2+)-dependent exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface. When a mouse B-cell line, Ba/F3, was treated with a Ca(2+) ionophore under low-Ca(2+) conditions, it reversibly exposed PtdSer. Using this property, we established a Ba/F3 subline that strongly exposed PtdSer by repetitive fluorescence-activated cell sorting. A complementary DNA library was constructed from the subline, and a cDNA that caused Ba/F3 to expose PtdSer spontaneously was identified by expression cloning. The cDNA encoded a constitutively active mutant of TMEM16F, a protein with eight transmembrane segments. Wild-type TMEM16F was localized on the plasma membrane and conferred Ca(2+)-dependent scrambling of phospholipids. A patient with Scott syndrome, which results from a defect in phospholipid scrambling activity, was found to carry a mutation at a splice-acceptor site of the gene encoding TMEM16F, causing the premature termination of the protein.",

We can distinguish single and multiple motor-driven cargoes and show that the stall forces for inward and outward transported cargoes are similar.

        "Abstract": "The relationships among gene regulatory mechanisms in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum throughout its asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) remain poorly understood. To investigate the level and nature of transcriptional activity and its role in controlling gene expression during the IDC, we performed nuclear run-on on whole-transcriptome samples from time points throughout the IDC and found a peak in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional activity related to both the number of nuclei per parasite and variable transcriptional activity per nucleus over time. These differential total transcriptional activity levels allowed the calculation of the absolute transcriptional activities of individual genes from gene-specific nuclear run-on hybridization data. For half of the genes analyzed, sense-strand transcriptional activity peaked at the same time point as total activity. The antisense strands of several genes were substantially transcribed. Comparison of the transcriptional activity of the sense strand of each gene to its steady-state RNA abundance across the time points assayed revealed both correlations and discrepancies, implying transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, respectively. Our results demonstrate that such comparisons can effectively indicate gene regulatory mechanisms in P. falciparum and suggest that genes with diverse transcriptional activity levels and patterns combine to produce total transcriptional activity levels tied to parasite development during the IDC.",

Here, we have developed a novel strategy for two-dimensional tracking of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with 25 mus time resolution and approximately 1.5 nm spatial precision, by using a quadrant photodiode to record the positions of GNPs in an objective-type dark-field microscope. In combination with a feedback loop, this technique records long, high time-resolution and spatial precision trajectories of endocytosed GNPs transported by the molecular motors kinesin and dynein in a living cell. In the full range of organelle velocities (0-8 microm s(-1)), we clearly resolve the individual 8 nm steps of cargoes carried by kinesin, and the 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 nm steps of those carried by dynein. These experiments yield new information about molecular motor stepping in living cells.",

        "Abstract": "We present a real-time target-locking confocal microscope that follows an object moving along an arbitrary path, even as it simultaneously changes its shape, size and orientation. This Target-locking Acquisition with Realtime Confocal (TARC) microscopy system integrates fast image processing and rapid image acquisition using a Nipkow spinning-disk confocal microscope. The system acquires a 3D stack of images, performs a full structural analysis to locate a feature of interest, moves the sample in response, and then collects the next 3D image stack. In this way, data collection is dynamically adjusted to keep a moving object centered in the field of view. We demonstrate the system's capabilities by target-locking freely-diffusing clusters of attractive colloidal particles, and activelytransported quantum dots (QDs) endocytosed into live cells free to move in three dimensions, for several hours. During this time, both the colloidal clusters and live cells move distances several times the length of the imaging volume.",

        "Title": "Expression of the phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR) gene family during the acute phase response.",
        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a member of PLSCR gene family that has been implicated in multiple cellular processes including movement of phospholipids, gene regulation, immuno-activation, and cell proliferation/apoptosis. In the present study, we identified PLSCR1 as a positive intracellular acute phase protein that is upregulated by LPS in liver, heart, and adipose tissue, but not skeletal muscle. LPS administration resulted in a marked increase in PLSCR1 mRNA and protein levels in the liver. This stimulation occurred rapidly (within 2 h), and was very sensitive to LPS (half-maximal response at 0.1 microg/mouse). Moreover, two other APR-inducers, zymosan and turpentine, also produced significant increases in PLSCR1 mRNA and protein levels, indicating that PLSCR1 was stimulated in a number of models of the APR. To determine signaling pathways by which LPS stimulated PLSCR1, we examined the effect of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo. TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 all stimulated PLSCR1 in cultured Hep B3 hepatocytes, whereas only TNFalpha stimulated PLSCR1 in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, suggesting cell type-specific effects of cytokines. Furthermore, the LPS-stimulated increase in liver PLSCR1 mRNA was greatly attenuated by 80% in TNFalpha and IL-1beta receptor null mice as compared to wild-type controls. In contrast, PLSCR1 levels in adipose tissue were induced to a similar extent in TNFalpha and IL-1beta receptor null mice and controls. These results indicate that maximal stimulation of PLSCR1 by LPS in liver required TNFalpha and/or IL-1beta, whereas the stimulation of PLSCR1 in adipose tissue is not dependent on TNFalpha and/or IL-1beta. These data provide evidence that PLSCR1 is a positive intracellular acute phase protein with a tissue-specific mechanism for up-regulation.",

        "Title": "Discovering your authentic leadership.",
        "Abstract": "The ongoing problems in business leadership over the past five years have underscored the need for a new kind of leader in the twenty-first century: the authentic leader. Author Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor and the former chairman and CEO of Medtronic, and his colleagues, conducted the largest leadership development study ever undertaken. They interviewed 125 business leaders from different racial, religious, national, and socioeconomic backgrounds to understand how leaders become and remain authentic. Their interviews showed that you do not have to be born with any particular characteristics or traits to lead. You also do not have to be at the top of your organization. Anyone can learn to be an authentic leader. The journey begins with leaders understanding their life stories. Authentic leaders frame their stories in ways that allow them to see themselves not as passive observers but as individuals who learn from their experiences. These leaders make time to examine their experiences and to reflect on them, and in doing so they grow as individuals and as leaders. Authentic leaders also work hard at developing self-awareness through persistent and often courageous self-exploration. Denial can be the greatest hurdle that leaders face in becoming self-aware, but authentic leaders ask for, and listen to, honest feedback. They also use formal and informal support networks to help them stay grounded and lead integrated lives. The authors argue that achieving business results over a sustained period of time is the ultimate mark of authentic leadership. It may be possible to drive short-term outcomes without being authentic, but authentic leadership is the only way to create long-term results.",

The brightness and photostability of quantum dots allow us to record motor displacement traces with 300 micros time resolution and 1.5 nm spatial precision. We observed individual 8 nm steps in active transport toward both the microtubule plus- and minus-ends, the directions of kinesin and dynein movements, respectively. In addition, we clearly resolved abrupt 16 nm steps in the plus-end direction and often consecutive 16 nm and occasional 24 nm steps in minus-end directed movements. This work demonstrates the ability of the QD assay to probe the operation of motor proteins at the molecular level in living cells under physiological conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a multiply palmitoylated, endofacial membrane protein originally identified based on its capacity to promote accelerated transbilayer phospholipid movement in response to Ca(2+). Recent evidence suggests that this protein also participates in cell response to various growth factors and cytokines, influencing myeloid differentiation, tumor growth, and the antiviral activity of interferon. Whereas plasma membrane PLSCR1 was shown to be required for normal recruitment and activation of Src kinase by stimulated cell surface growth factor receptors, PLSCR1 was also found to traffic into the nucleus and to tightly bind to genomic DNA, suggesting a possible additional nuclear function. We now report evidence that PLSCR1 directly binds to the 5'-promoter region of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 1 gene (IP3R1) to enhance expression of the receptor. Probing a CpG island genomic library with PLSCR1 as bait identified four clones with avidity for PLSCR1, including a 191-bp fragment of the IP3R1 promoter. Using electrophoretic mobility shift and transcription reporter assays, the PLSCR1-binding site in IP3R1 was mapped to residues (-101)GTAACCATGTGGA(-89), and the segment spanning Met(86)-Glu(118) in PLSCR1 was identified to mediate its transcriptional activity. The significance of this interaction between PLSCR1 and IP3R1 in situ was confirmed by comparing levels of IP3R1 mRNA and protein in matched cells that either expressed or were deficient in PLSCR1. These data suggest that in addition to its role at the plasma membrane, effects of PLSCR1 on cell proliferative and maturational responses may also relate to alterations in expression of cellular IP3 receptors.",

        "Abstract": "In several previous studies, we performed sensitivity analysis to gauge the relative importance of different atomic partial charges in determining protein-ligand binding. In this work, we gain further insights by decomposing these results into three contributions: desolvation, intramolecular interactions, and intermolecular interactions, again based on a Poisson continuum electrostatics model. Three protein kinase-inhibitor systems have been analyzed: CDK2-deschloroflavopiridol, PKA-PKI, and LCK-PP2. Although our results point out the importance of specific intermolecular interactions to the binding affinity, they also reveal the remarkable contributions from the solvent-mediated intramolecular interactions in some cases. Thus, it is necessary to look beyond analyzing protein-ligand interactions to understand protein-ligand recognition or to gain insights into designing ligands and proteins. In analyzing the contributions of the three components to the overall binding free energy, the PKA-PKI system with a much larger ligand was found to behave differently from the other two systems with smaller ligands. In the former case, the intermolecular interactions are very favorable, and together with the favorable solvent-mediated intramolecular interactions, they overcome the large desolvation penalties to give a favorable electrostatics contribution to the overall binding affinity. On the other hand, the other two systems with smaller ligands only present modest intermolecular interactions and they are not or are only barely sufficient to overcome the desolvation penalty even with the aid of the favorable intramolecular contributions. As a result, the binding affinity of these two systems do not or only barely benefit from electrostatics contributions.",

        "Abstract": "Data on the status about iodine nutrition in children in Papua New Guinea (PNG) are scarce. This study attempts to determine the mean daily per capita consumption of salt, the iodine content of salt in the households and retail shops and the urinary iodine concentration in children (6-12 years) in Hella Region, Southern Highland Province (SHP), PNG. The mean daily consumption of salt was 2.62 +/- 1.29 g. The iodine content of salt was >30 p.p.m. in 95 per cent of households and 100 per cent of retail shops. The median urinary iodine concentration of 48.0 mg/l for all the children indicates moderate iodine deficiency. The median urinary iodine concentrations for the male (67.0 mg/l) and female (44.0 mg/l) children indicate mild and moderate iodine deficiency, respectively. 68.42 per cent of the male and 81.82 per cent of the female children have urinary iodine concentration <100 mg/l, indicating that iodine deficiency is a potential public health problem in the Hella region. These results indicate a need for further assessment of the implementation of the universal salt iodization strategy for the elimination of iodine deficiency in the SHP, PNG.",

One member of this toxin family, Streptococcus intermedius intermedilysin (ILY), exhibits a narrow spectrum of cellular specificity that is seemingly inconsistent with this premise. We show here that ILY, via its domain 4 structure, binds to the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein human CD59 (huCD59). CD59 is an inhibitor of the membrane attack complex of human complement. ILY specifically binds to huCD59 via residues that are the binding site for the C8alpha and C9 complement proteins.

        "Abstract": "The phospholipid scramblases (PLSCR1 to PLSCR4) are a structurally and functionally unique class of proteins, which are products of a tetrad of genes conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. The best characterized member of this family, PLSCR1, is implicated in the remodeling of the transbilayer distribution of plasma membrane phospholipids but is also required for normal signaling through select growth factor receptors. Mice with targeted deletion of PLSCR1 display perinatal granulocytopenia due to defective response of hematopoietic precursors to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and stem cell factor. To gain insight into the biologic function of another member of the PLSCR family, we investigated mice with targeted deletion of PLSCR3, a protein that like PLSCR1 is expressed in many blood cells but which, by contrast to PLSCR1, is also highly expressed in fat and muscle. PLSCR3(-/-) mice at 2 months of age displayed aberrant accumulation of abdominal fat when maintained on standard rodent chow, which was accompanied by insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia. Primary adipocytes and cultured bone-marrow-derived macrophages from PLSCR3(-/-) mice were engorged with neutral lipid, and adipocytes displayed defective responses to exogenous insulin. Plasma of PLSCR3(-/-) mice was elevated in non-high-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids, and leptin, whereas adiponectin was low. These data suggest that the expression of PLSCR3 may be required for normal adipocyte and/or macrophage maturation or function and raise the possibility that deletions or mutations affecting the PLSCR3(-/-) gene locus may contribute to the risk for lipid-related disorders in humans.",

        "Title": "Charge optimization of the interface between protein kinases and their ligands.",
        "Abstract": "Examining the potential for electrostatic complementarity between a ligand and a receptor is a useful technique for rational drug design, and can demonstrate how a system prioritizes interactions when allowed to optimize its charge distribution. In this computational study, we implemented the previously developed, continuum solvent-based charge optimization theory with a simple, quadratic programming algorithm and the UHBD Poisson-Boltzmann solver. This method allows one to compute the best set of point charges for a ligand or ligand region based on the ligand and receptor shape, and the receptor partial charges, by optimizing the binding free energy obtained from a continuum-solvent model. We applied charge optimization to a fragment of the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) of protein kinase A (PKA), to three flavopiridol inhibitors of CDK2, and to cyclin A which interacts with CDK2 to regulate the cell cycle. We found that a combination of global (involving every charge) and local (involving only charges in a local region) optimization can give useful hints for designing better inhibitors. Although some parts of an inhibitor may already contribute significantly to binding, we found that they could still be the most important targets for modifications to obtain stronger binders. In studying the binding of flavopiridol inhibitors to CDK2, comparable binding affinity could be obtained regardless of whether the net charges of the inhibitors were constrained to -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2 during the optimization. This provides flexibility in inhibitor design when a certain net charge of the inhibitor is desired in addition to strong binding affinity. For the study of the PKA-PKI and CDK2-cyclin A interfaces, we identified residues whose charge distributions are already close to optimal and those whose charge distributions could be refined to further improve binding.",

        "Title": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 is imported into the nucleus by a receptor-mediated pathway and interacts with DNA.",
        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a multiply palmitoylated, Ca(2+)-binding, endofacial plasma membrane protein originally identified by its capacity to accelerate transbilayer movement of membrane phospholipids. We recently reported that when palmitoylation of PLSCR1 does not occur, it is localized to the nucleus rather than the plasma membrane. Nuclear localization of PLSCR1 was also observed upon induction of its de novo synthesis by cytokines such as interferon alpha that activate the PLSCR1 gene. Despite its capacity to enter the nucleus, its sequence does not predict a nuclear localization signal. To gain insight into the mechanism and potential significance of nuclear PLSCR1, we investigated the conditions required for its import and retention in the nucleus. We show that nuclear localization of PLSCR1 is dependent on cytosolic factors and energy. Furthermore, we show that PLSCR1 is specifically transported into the nucleus by the importin alpha/beta import pathway, and binds directly and with high affinity to importin alpha. Analysis of deletion mutants suggested that the NLS of PLSCR1 is between residues 242 and 290 and, furthermore, that a peptide within this region encompassing residues (257)GKISKHWTGI(266) is sufficient for nuclear import when conjugated to BSA. In addition, in intact cells, mutation of positively charged amino acids within this putative NLS in the full-length protein completely blocked its entry into the nucleus, consistent with its role in targeting PLSCR1 to the nucleus. Release of PLSCR1 from the nucleus was only observed after treatment of cells with both detergent and an elevated NaCl concentration, or following DNase treatment of the nucleus, suggesting ionic interactions of PLSCR1 with a nuclear component bound to genomic DNA or directly with genomic DNA. Purified PLSCR1 was also found to bind directly to a genomic DNA-cellulose conjugate, and its elution from DNA also required an elevated NaCl concentration. These data support a mechanism of receptor-mediated nuclear import of PLSCR1 and suggest a potential nuclear function for this plasma membrane protein.",

        "Abstract": "The cyclin-dependent protein kinases are important targets in drug discovery because of their role in cell cycle regulation. In this computational study, we have applied a continuum solvent model to study the interactions between cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and analogues of the clinically tested anticancer agent flavopiridol. The continuum solvent model uses Coulomb's law to account for direct electrostatic interactions, solves the Poisson equation to obtain the electrostatic contributions to solvation energy, and calculates scaled solvent-accessible surface area to account for hydrophobic interactions. The computed free energy of binding gauges the strength of protein-ligand interactions. Our model was first validated through a study on the binding of a number of flavopiridol derivatives to CDK2, and its ability to identify potent inhibitors was observed. The model was then used to aid in the design of novel CDK2 inhibitors with the aid of a computational sensitivity analysis. Some of these hypothetical structures could be significantly more potent than the lead compound flavopiridol. We applied two approaches to gain insights into designing selective inhibitors. One relied on the comparative analysis of the binding pocket for several hundred protein kinases to identify the parts of a lead compound whose modifications might lead to selective compounds. The other was based on building and using homology models for energy calculations. The homology models appear to be able to classify ligand potency into groups but cannot yet give reliable quantitative results.",

        "Title": "Palmitoylation of phospholipid scramblase 1 controls its distribution between nucleus and plasma membrane.",
        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a Ca(2+)-binding, endofacial plasma membrane protein thought to contribute to the transbilayer movement of phosphatidylserine and other membrane phospholipids that is observed upon influx of calcium into the cytosol. Expression of PLSCR1 is markedly induced by interferon and other cytokines, and PLSCR1-/- bone marrow cells exhibit defective myeloid proliferation and differentiation in response to stimulation by select growth factors, implying that PLSCR1 also functions in cytokine signaling or response pathways. PLSCR1 is multiply palmitoylated and partitions into membrane lipid raft domains. We have now identified the Cys-rich sequence (184)CCCPCC(189) in PLSCR1 as required for palmitoylation of the polypeptide. Mutation of these five cysteines abrogates PLSCR1 trafficking to the plasma membrane and results in virtually all of the expressed protein localizing to the nucleus. Consistent with this observation, cell treatment with the palmitoylation inhibitor, 2-bromo-palmitate, results in a marked redistribution of endogenous PLSCR1 from plasma membrane to nucleus. In a small percentage of untreated cells, predominantly nuclear localization of PLSCR1 is also observed. Furthermore, PLSCR1 is also found in the nucleus following its cytokine-induced expression. These data suggest that under the circumstance of rapid biosynthesis in response to gene induction by cytokines, PLSCR1 traffics into the nucleus, implying a potential nuclear function for this protein.",

        "Title": "The B cell antigen receptor regulates the transcriptional activator beta-catenin via protein kinase C-mediated inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3.",
        "Abstract": "Beta-catenin is a transcriptional activator that is regulated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). GSK-3 is constitutively active in unstimulated cells where it phosphorylates beta-catenin, targeting beta-catenin for rapid degradation. Receptor-induced inhibition of GSK-3 allows beta-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and then translocate to the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1. Wnt hormones, the best known regulators of beta-catenin, inhibit GSK-3 via the Disheveled protein. However, GSK-3 is also inhibited when it is phosphorylated by Akt, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We have previously shown that B cell Ag receptor (BCR) signaling leads to activation of PI3K and Akt as well as inhibition of GSK-3. Therefore, we hypothesized that BCR engagement would induce the accumulation of beta-catenin via a PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 pathway. We now show that BCR ligation causes an increase in the level of beta-catenin in the nuclear fraction of B cells as well as an increase in beta-catenin-dependent transcription. Direct inhibition of GSK-3 by LiCl also increased beta-catenin levels in B cells. This suggests that GSK-3 keeps beta-catenin levels low in unstimulated B cells and that BCR-induced inhibition of GSK-3 allows the accumulation of beta-catenin. Surprisingly, we found that the BCR-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3 on its negative regulatory sites, as well as the subsequent up-regulation of beta-catenin, was not mediated by Akt but by the phospholipase C-dependent activation of protein kinase C. Thus, the BCR regulates beta-catenin levels via a phospholipase C/protein kinase C/GSK-3 pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is an endofacial plasma membrane protein proposed to participate in transbilayer movement of phosphatidylserine and other phospholipids. In addition to its putative role in the reorganization of plasma membrane phospholipids, PLSCR1 is a substrate of intracellular kinases that imply its possible participation in diverse signaling pathways underlying proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis. Because PLSCR1 is prominently expressed in a variety of blood cells, we evaluated PLSCR activity in platelets and erythrocytes, and cytokine-dependent growth of hematopoietic precursor cells, of PLSCR1 knock-out mice. Adult PLSCR1(-/-) mice showed no obvious hematologic or hemostatic abnormality, and blood cells from these animals normally mobilized phosphatidylserine to the cell surface upon stimulation. Whereas blood cell counts in adult PLSCR1(-/-) mice were normal, in both fetus and newborn animals neutrophil counts were significantly depressed relative to age-matched wild type (WT). Furthermore, when compared with WT, hematopoietic precursor cells from PLSCR1(-/-) mice showed defective colony formation and impaired differentiation to mature granulocytes as stimulated by stem cell factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). By contrast, PLSCR1(-/-) cells showed normal colony formation stimulated by interleukin-3 or granulocyte-macrophage CSF, and expansion of megakaryocytic and erythroid progenitors by thrombopoietin or erythropoietin was unaffected. Stem cell factor and G-CSF were also found to induce marked increases in PLSCR1 levels in WT cells. Consistent with in vitro assays, PLSCR1(-/-) mice treated with G-CSF showed less than 50% of the granulocytosis observed in identically treated WT mice. These data provide direct evidence that PLSCR1 functionally contributes to cytokine-regulated cell proliferation and differentiation and suggest it is required for normal myelopoiesis.",

        "Title": "Plasma membrane phospholipid scramblase 1 is enriched in lipid rafts and interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor.",
        "Abstract": "We have identified physical and functional interactions between the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), an endofacial plasma membrane protein proposed to affect phospholipid organization. PLSCR1, a palmitoylated protein, was found to partition with the EGF receptor in membrane lipid rafts. Cell stimulation with EGF transiently elevated Tyr-phosphorylation of PLSCR1, peaking at 5 min. Although PLSCR1 is a known substrate of c-Abl [Sun, J., et al. (2001) J.Biol. Chem. 276, 28984-28990], the Abl inhibitor STI571 did not substantially affect its EGF-dependent phosphorylation, suggesting PLSCR1 is a substrate of the EGF receptor kinase, or another EGF-activated kinase. Coinciding with phosphorylation, there was a transient increase in physical association of PLSCR1 with both the EGF receptor and the adapter protein Shc, as determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis revealed that EGF initiates rapid internalization of both the EGF receptor and PLSCR1, with trafficking into both distinct and common endosomal pools. These data also suggested that whereas the EGF receptor is ultimately degraded, much of the endocytosed PLSCR1 is recycled to the cell surface within 3 h after EGF treatment. Consistent with this interpretation, Western blotting revealed neither ubiquitination nor proteolysis of PLSCR1 under these conditions, whereas the ubiquitination and degradation of the EGF receptor were readily confirmed. Finally, stimulation with EGF was also found to markedly increase the total cellular expression of PLSCR1, suggesting that in addition to its initial interactions with activated EGF receptor, PLSCR1 may also contribute to posttranscriptional effector pathway(s) mediating the cellular response to EGF.",

        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is an IFN-inducible, endofacial plasma membrane protein that has been proposed to mediate accelerated transbilayer movement of plasma membrane phospholipids in cells exposed to elevated cytoplasmic [Ca (2+)]. The marked transcriptional up-regulation of this gene by IFN in a wide variety of cell types suggested that PLSCR1 might also contribute to biological effects associated with IFN. To study the potential contribution of cellular PLSCR1 to the antiproliferative and tumor-suppressive activities of IFN, PLSCR1 cDNA was stably expressed in the human ovarian cancer cell line HEY1B, and the growth of these cells was compared with matched vector transfected controls both in vitro and in vivo. Whereas we detected no difference in either growth rate or morphology between PLSCR1-transfected cells and vector controls during in vitro culture in serum, when these cells were implanted s.c. into athymic nude mice, we observed a marked suppression of tumor development from cells transfected to express elevated levels of PLSCR1. Tumors from the PLSCR1-transfected cells were greatly reduced in size, showed increased infiltration of leukocytes and macrophages, and appeared to undergo differentiation to a more uniform and spindle-shaped morphology that markedly contrasted the highly undifferentiated and pleiomorphic cell shape normally observed for HEY1B cells in vitro or for vector-transfected control HEY1B cells both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that the up-regulation of PLSCR1 expression in tumor cells exposed to IFN may contribute to the observed tumor-suppressive action of this cytokine.",
