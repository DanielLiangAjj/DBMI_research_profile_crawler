        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CeD) is a gluten-induced enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals upon consumption of cereal gluten proteins. It is a unique and complex immune disorder to study as the driving antigen is known and the tissue targeted by the immune reaction can be interrogated. This review integrates findings gained from genetic, biochemical, and immunologic studies, which together have revealed mechanisms of gluten peptide modification and HLA binding, thereby enabling a maladapted anti-gluten immune response. Observations in human samples combined with experimental mouse models have revealed that the gluten-induced immune response involves CD4",

        "Abstract": "Clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) correlate with T cell infiltrates, but the specific contributions of heterogenous T cell types remain unclear. To investigate the diverse function of T cells in CRC, we profiled 37,931 T cells from tumors and adjacent normal colon of 16 patients with CRC with respect to transcriptome, TCR sequence, and cell surface markers. Our analysis identified phenotypically and functionally distinguishable effector T cell types. We employed single-cell gene signatures from these T cell subsets to query the TCGA database to assess their prognostic significance. We found 2 distinct cytotoxic T cell types. GZMK+KLRG1+ cytotoxic T cells were enriched in CRC patients with good outcomes. GNLY+CD103+ cytotoxic T cells with a dysfunctional phenotype were not associated with good outcomes, despite coexpression of CD39 and CD103, markers that denote tumor reactivity. We found 2 distinct Treg subtypes associated with opposite outcomes. While total Tregs were associated with good outcomes, CD38+ Tregs were associated with bad outcomes independently of stage and possessed a highly suppressive phenotype, suggesting that they inhibit antitumor immunity in CRC. These findings highlight the potential utility of these subpopulations in predicting outcomes and support the potential for novel therapies directed at CD38+ Tregs or CD8+CD103+ T cells.",

The idea of cancer immunosurveillance was first conceived over a century ago but remained controversial through much of the 20th century. In the past few decades, however, the field has progressed rapidly, and the concept of tumor immunosurveillance is now well established. With this chapter, we provide a historical background of immunosurveillance, the concept of immunoediting, and the role of different T-cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment. We also discuss the relationship between immune checkpoints, tumor antigens, T cell receptor repertoire, and immunosurveillance. Finally, we comment on the future of immunotherapy as it relates to T cell immunosurveillance.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple myeloma is characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. But the phenotypic diversity and the contribution of less predominant B-lineage clones to the biology of this disease have been controversial. Here, we asked whether cells bearing the dominant multiple myeloma immunoglobulin rearrangement occupy phenotypic compartments other than that of plasma cells. To accomplish this, we combined 13-parameter FACS index sorting and t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization with high-throughput single-cell immunoglobulin sequencing to track selected B-lineage clones across different stages of human B-cell development. As expected, the predominant clones preferentially mapped to aberrant plasma cell compartments, albeit phenotypically altered from wild type. Interestingly, up to 1.2% of cells of the predominant clones colocalized with B-lineage cells of a normal phenotype. In addition, minor clones with distinct immunoglobulin sequences were detected in up to 9% of sequenced cells, but only 2 out of 12 of these clones showed aberrant immune phenotypes. The majority of these minor clones showed intraclonal silent nucleotide differences within the CDR3s and varying frequencies of somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin genes. Therefore, the phenotypic range of multiple myeloma cells in the bone marrow is not confined to aberrant-phenotype plasma cells but extends to low frequencies of normal-phenotype B cells, in line with the recently reported success of B cell-targeting cellular therapies in some patients. The majority of minor clones result from parallel nonmalignant expansion. ",

        "Abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-17 plays a key role in immunity. In acute infections, a rapid IL-17 response must be induced without prior antigen exposure, and γδ T cells are the major initial IL-17 producers. In fact, some γδ T cells make IL-17 within hours after an immune challenge. These cells appear to acquire the ability to respond to IL-1 and IL-23 and to make IL-17 naturally in naïve animals. They are known as the natural Tγδ17 (nTγδ17) cells. The rapidity of the nTγδ17 response, and the apparent lack of explicit T cell receptor (TCR) engagement for its induction have led to the view that this is a cytokine (IL-1, IL-23)-mediated response. However, pharmacological inhibition or genetic defects in TCR signaling drastically reduce the nTγδ17 response and/or their presence. To better understand antigen recognition in this rapid IL-17 response, we analyzed the antigen receptor repertoire of IL-1R(+)/IL-23R(+) γδ T cells, a proxy for nTγδ17 cells in naïve animals directly ex vivo, using a barcode-enabled high throughput single-cell TCR sequence analysis. We found that regardless of their anatomical origin, these cells have a highly focused TCR repertoire. In particular, the TCR sequences have limited V gene combinations, little or no junctional diversity and much reduced or no N region diversity. In contrast, IL-23R(-) cells at mucosal sites similar to most of the splenic γδ T cells and small intestine epithelial γδ lymphocytes expressed diverse TCRs. This remarkable commonality and restricted repertoire of IL-1R(+)/IL-23R(+) γδ T cells underscores the importance of antigen recognition in their establishment/function.",

Each TCR is a heterodimer, and both α- and β-chains contribute to determining TCR antigen specificity. Here we present a methodology enabling integration of information about TCR specificity with information about T cell function. This method involves sequencing of TCRα and TCRβ genes, and amplifying functional genes characteristic of different T cell subsets, in single T cells. Because this approach retains information about individual TCRα-TCRβ pairs, TCRs of interest can be expressed and used in functional studies, for antigen discovery, or in therapeutic applications. We apply this approach to study the clonal ancestry and differentiation of T lymphocytes infiltrating a human colorectal carcinoma.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in technology and data analysis have made it possible to take a new look at human immunology. These advances run the gamut from systems biology approaches, which are likely in the vanguard of how we can start \"to put the pieces together\" of immune function, to a deeper understanding of specific diseases and vaccines and the immune repertoire. In our own experience, we have also found that asking simple questions about human immunity has often given us very surprising answers, causing a rethink of established dogma. Thus, we have developed a new perspective on the nature of the αβ TCR repertoire and also the likely role of T-cell repertoire (TCR) cross-reactivity in generating T memory independent of specific antigen interactions. These findings show that human immunology is not just a necessary step for \"translating\" basic immunology to treat diseases or develop better vaccines, but is also an important complement to the inbred mouse model.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease is an intestinal autoimmune disease driven by dietary gluten and gluten-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses. In celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, exposure to gluten induces the appearance of gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells with gut-homing potential in the peripheral blood. Here we show that gluten exposure also induces the appearance of activated, gut-homing CD8(+) αβ and γδ T cells in the peripheral blood. Single-cell T-cell receptor sequence analysis indicates that both of these cell populations have highly focused T-cell receptor repertoires, indicating that their induction is antigen-driven. These results reveal a previously unappreciated role of antigen in the induction of CD8(+) αβ and γδ T cells in celiac disease and demonstrate a coordinated response by all three of the major types of T cells. More broadly, these responses may parallel adaptive immune responses to viral pathogens and other systemic autoimmune diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Although T cell memory is generally thought to require direct antigen exposure, we found an abundance of memory-phenotype cells (20%-90%, averaging over 50%) of CD4(+) T cells specific to viral antigens in adults who had never been infected. These cells express the appropriate memory markers and genes, rapidly produce cytokines, and have clonally expanded. In contrast, the same T cell receptor (TCR) specificities in newborns are almost entirely naïve, which might explain the vulnerability of young children to infections. One mechanism for this phenomenon is TCR cross-reactivity to environmental antigens, and in support of this, we found extensive cross-recognition by HIV-1 and influenza-reactive T lymphocytes to other microbial peptides and expansion of one of these after influenza vaccination. Thus, the presence of these memory-phenotype T cells has significant implications for immunity to novel pathogens, child and adult health, and the influence of pathogen-rich versus hygienic environments.",

        "Abstract": "Bam32 is an adaptor protein recruited to the plasma membrane upon B cell receptor (BCR) crosslinking in a phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner; however, its physiologic function is unclear. To determine its physiologic function, we produced Bam32-deficient mice. Bam32(-/-) B cells develop normally but have impaired T-independent antibody responses in vivo and diminished responses to BCR crosslinking in vitro. Biochemical analysis revealed that Bam32 acts in a novel pathway leading from the BCR to MAPK/ERK Kinases (MEK1/2), MAPK/ERK Kinase Kinase-1 (MEKK1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). This pathway appears to be initiated by hematopoietic progenitor kinase-1 (HPK1), which interacts directly with Bam32, and differs from all previously characterized BCR signaling pathways in that it is required for normal BCR-mediated proliferation but not for B cell survival.",
