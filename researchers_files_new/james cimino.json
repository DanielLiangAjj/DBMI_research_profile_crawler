As electronic health records begin to include patients' genomic data, recommendations will be formulated at an increasing rate. This study examined recommendations related to the current list of 73 actionable genes compiled by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and found that conditions fall generally into five classes (cardiovascular, medication interactions, metabolic, neoplastic, and structural), with recommendations falling into seven categories (actions or circumstances to avoid, evaluation of relatives at risk, pregnancy management, prevention of primary manifestations, prevention of secondary complications, surveillance, and treatment of manifestations). This study represents a first step in facilitating automated, scalable clinical decision support and provides direction on formal representation of the contexts and actions for clinical recommendations derived from genome-informed learning health systems.",

        "Abstract": "Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) in the U.S. has been followed by unintended consequences, overexposing clinicians to widely reported EHR limitations. As an attempt to fixing the EHR, we propose the use of a clinical context ontology (CCO), applied to turn implicit contextual statements into formally represented data in the form of concept-relationship-concept tuples. These tuples form what we call a patient specific knowledge base (PSKB), a collection of formally defined tuples containing facts about the patient's care context. We report the process to create a CCO, which guides annotation of structured and narrative patient data to produce a PSKB. We also present an application of our PSKB using real patient data displayed on a semantically oriented patient summary to improve EHR navigation. Our approach can potentially save precious time spent by clinicians using today's EHRs, by showing a chronological view of the patient's record along with contextual statements needed for care decisions with minimum effort. We propose several other applications of a PSKB to improve multiple EHR functions to guide future research.",

        "Abstract": "With the burgeoning development of computational phenotypes, it is increasingly difficult to identify the right phenotype for the right tasks. This study uses a mixed-methods approach to develop and evaluate a novel metadata framework for retrieval of and reusing computational phenotypes. Twenty active phenotyping researchers from 2 large research networks, Electronic Medical Records and Genomics and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, were recruited to suggest metadata elements. Once consensus was reached on 39 metadata elements, 47 new researchers were surveyed to evaluate the utility of the metadata framework. The survey consisted of 5-Likert multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. Two more researchers were asked to use the metadata framework to annotate 8 type-2 diabetes mellitus phenotypes. More than 90% of the survey respondents rated metadata elements regarding phenotype definition and validation methods and metrics positively with a score of 4 or 5. Both researchers completed annotation of each phenotype within 60 min. Our thematic analysis of the narrative feedback indicates that the metadata framework was effective in capturing rich and explicit descriptions and enabling the search for phenotypes, compliance with data standards, and comprehensive validation metrics. Current limitations were its complexity for data collection and the entailed human costs.",

        "Abstract": "A panel sponsored by the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI) at the 2021 AMIA Symposium addressed the provocative question: \"Are Electronic Health Records dumbing down clinicians?\" After reviewing electronic health record (EHR) development and evolution, the panel discussed how EHR use can impair care delivery. Both suboptimal functionality during EHR use and longer-term effects outside of EHR use can reduce clinicians' efficiencies, reasoning abilities, and knowledge. Panel members explored potential solutions to problems discussed. Progress will require significant engagement from clinician-users, educators, health systems, commercial vendors, regulators, and policy makers. Future EHR systems must become more user-focused and scalable and enable providers to work smarter to deliver improved care.",

        "Abstract": "The existence of systemic racism in US health care is widely recognized, but the role that informatics plays has received little attention. Clinical guidelines, which can incorporate implicit racial bias or be adhered to in racially disparate ways, are often the basis for clinical alerting systems. It is also possible that clinicians might be discriminatory in their response to alerts (for example, by deciding whether to agree or override the alert). We sought to study whether alert logic in our hospital uses patient race as part of its criteria and if alert override rates show any racial disparities. We obtained data on 5,120,114 alert events at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital and examined override the rates and reasons with respect to patient race. We found override rates of 82.27% and 81.30% for Black or African American patients and White patients, respectively. Some differences by alert were statistically significant but generally small. Override patterns varied by clinician but reasons given were generally not disparate, suggesting that if racist behavior is present, it is not widely systemic. However, the great variability in individual clinician behavior suggests that deeper analysis is warranted to determine whether disparities are indeed racist in nature.",

Its intention was to provide physicians, medical librarians and others engaged in health care with a basic understanding of the major topics in informatics so that they could return to their home institutions as \"change agents\". Over the years, the course provided week-long, intense, morning-to-night experiences for some 1,350 students, consisting of lectures and hands-on project development, taught by many luminaries in the field, not the least of which was Donald A.B.

        "Abstract": "Development of evidence-based practice requires practice-based evidence, which can be acquired through analysis of real-world data from electronic health records (EHRs). The EHR contains volumes of information about patients-physical measurements, diagnoses, exposures, and markers of health behavior-that can be used to create algorithms for risk stratification or to gain insight into associations between exposures, interventions, and outcomes. But to transform real-world data into reliable real-world evidence, one must not only choose the correct analytical methods but also have an understanding of the quality, detail, provenance, and organization of the underlying source data and address the differences in these characteristics across sites when conducting analyses that span institutions. This manuscript explores the idiosyncrasies inherent in the capture, formatting, and standardization of EHR data and discusses the clinical domain and informatics competencies required to transform the raw clinical, real-world data into high-quality, fit-for-purpose analytical data sets used to generate real-world evidence.",

        "Abstract": "The recipients of NIH's Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) have worked for over a decade to build informatics infrastructure in support of clinical and translational research. This infrastructure has proved invaluable for supporting responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic through direct patient care, clinical decision support, training researchers and practitioners, as well as public health surveillance and clinical research to levels that could not have been accomplished without the years of ground-laying work by the CTSAs. In this paper, we provide a perspective on our COVID-19 work and present relevant results of a survey of CTSA sites to broaden our understanding of the key features of their informatics programs, the informatics-related challenges they have experienced under COVID-19, and some of the innovations and solutions they developed in response to the pandemic. Responses demonstrated increased reliance by healthcare providers and researchers on access to electronic health record (EHR) data, both for local needs and for sharing with other institutions and national consortia. The initial work of the CTSAs on data capture, standards, interchange, and sharing policies all contributed to solutions, best illustrated by the creation, in record time, of a national clinical data repository in the National COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative (N3C). The survey data support seven recommendations for areas of informatics and public health investment and further study to support clinical and translational research in the post-COVID-19 era.",

Blood pressure (BP) is often documented as elevated, but no change in medication occurs (Medication Non-adjustment or MNA).

        "Abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) use alerts to help prevent medical errors, yet clinicians override many of these alerts due to desensitization from constant exposure (alert fatigue). We hypothesize that a clinician might override an alert warning about the dangers of a treatment if the patient's health is so poor that the treatment is worth the risk or if a patient's health suggests the treatment is not needed. We used logistic regression with general estimating equations to determine if the Early Warning Score (EWS), a measurement used to predict critical care need, could be used to predict alert overrides. EWS was a significant predictor of overrides for three alerts. Although EWS could not predict overrides for all alert rules, these results suggest that EWS may be helpful for some alerts, but that additional EHR data will be needed for predicting override behavior to a useful degree.",

The bad news is that evidence for the justification of the hype around health information technology (HIT) is conflicting, and the expected benefits of a digital health system have not yet materialized. We propose a national system for monitoring HIT impact based on the paradigm of the learning health system (LHS): learning from practical experience through high-quality, ongoing monitoring of care outcomes. Our proposal aims at leveraging current de facto standard research data repositories used to support large-scale clinical studies by incorporating data needed for more robust HIT assessments and application of rigorous research designs that are now feasible on a large scale.",

        "Abstract": "Efficient access to clinical data by investigators is critical for data-driven biomedical research. Mediated query is commonly adopted to facilitate data access for investigators. However, the query mediation process remains a black-box. This study analyzed the email-based dialogues between investigators and clinical data query mediators from three institutions. We identify discussion topics and their frequencies, model task flows, and analyze user needs for query mediation support revealed from the dialogues. While the datasets between different institutions are distinct in some notable respects, we find that together they provide common insights for streamlining data access. From our findings, we conclude an intelligent dialogue-based query support model is feasible to automate human-mediated clinical data access for investigators and stakeholders.",

Despite substantial effort by researchers and industry, complaints continue noting serious adverse effects on patient safety and clinician quality of life. I believe solutions are possible if we can add information to the record that explains the \"why\" of a patient's care, such as relationships between symptoms, physical findings, diagnostic results, differential diagnoses, therapeutic plans, and goals. While this information may be present in clinical notes, I propose that we modify electronic health records to support explicit representation of this information using formal structure and controlled vocabularies. Such information could foster development of more situation-aware tools for data retrieval and synthesis. Informatics research is needed to understand what should be represented, how to capture it, and how to benefit those providing the information so that their workload is reduced.",

        "Abstract": "The US health system has recently achieved widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems, primarily driven by financial incentives provided by the Meaningful Use (MU) program. Although successful in promoting EHR adoption and use, the program, and other contributing factors, also produced important unintended consequences (UCs) with far-reaching implications for the US health system. Based on our own experiences from large health information technology (HIT) adoption projects and a collection of key studies in HIT evaluation, we discuss the most prominent UCs of MU: failed expectations, EHR market saturation, innovation vacuum, physician burnout, and data obfuscation. We identify challenges resulting from these UCs and provide recommendations for future research to empower the broader medical and informatics communities to realize the full potential of a now digitized health system. We believe that fixing these unanticipated effects will demand efforts from diverse players such as health care providers, administrators, HIT vendors, policy makers, informatics researchers, funding agencies, and outside developers; promotion of new business models; collaboration between academic medical centers and informatics research departments; and improved methods for evaluations of HIT.",

In the clinical setting, this process is often facilitated by a patient registry. While the software architecture of federated patient registries for research has been well characterized, local registries focused on clinical quality and care have received less attention. Many clinical registries appear to be one-off projects that lack generalizability and the ability to scale to multiple diseases. We evaluate the applicability of existing registry guidelines for registries designed for clinical intervention, propose a software architecture more practical for single-institution clinical registries and report the implementation of a generalizable clinical patient registry architecture at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).",

We carried out a four-phase analysis of clinical case studies to characterize how such processes are represented through relationships between clinical terms. The result is an terminology of 26 relationships that were validated against published clinical cases with 85.4% interrater reliability. We believe that capturing patient-specific information with these relationships can lead to improvements in clinical decision support systems, information retrieval and learning health systems.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical narratives (the text notes found in patients' medical records) are important information sources for secondary use in research. However, in order to protect patient privacy, they must be de-identified prior to use. Manual de-identification is considered to be the gold standard approach but is tedious, expensive, slow, and impractical for use with large-scale clinical data. Automated or semi-automated de-identification using computer algorithms is a potentially promising alternative. The Informatics Institute of the University of Alabama at Birmingham is applying de-identification to clinical data drawn from the UAB hospital's electronic medical records system before releasing them for research. We participated in a shared task challenge by the Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science (CEGS) Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDoC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) at the de-identification regular track to gain experience developing our own automatic de-identification tool. We focused on the popular and successful methods from previous challenges: rule-based, dictionary-matching, and machine-learning approaches. We also explored new techniques such as disambiguation rules, term ambiguity measurement, and used multi-pass sieve framework at a micro level. For the challenge's primary measure (strict entity), our submissions achieved competitive results (f-measures: 87.3%, 87.1%, and 86.7%). For our preferred measure (binary token HIPAA), our submissions achieved superior results (f-measures: 93.7%, 93.6%, and 93%). With those encouraging results, we gain the confidence to improve and use the tool for the real de-identification task at the UAB Informatics Institute.",

        "Abstract": "Physicians intuitively apply pattern recognition when evaluating a patient. Rational diagnosis making requires that clinical patterns be put in the context of disease prior probability, yet physicians often exhibit flawed probabilistic reasoning. Difficulties in making a diagnosis are reflected in the high rates of deadly and costly diagnostic errors. Introduced 6 decades ago, computerized diagnosis support systems are still not widely used by internists. These systems cannot efficiently recognize patterns and are unable to consider the base rate of potential diagnoses. We review the limitations of current computer-aided diagnosis support systems. We then portray future diagnosis support systems and provide a conceptual framework for their development. We argue for capturing physician knowledge using a novel knowledge representation model of the clinical picture. This model (based on structured patient presentation patterns) holds not only symptoms and signs but also their temporal and semantic interrelations. We call for the collection of crowdsourced, automatically deidentified, structured patient patterns as means to support distributed knowledge accumulation and maintenance. In this approach, each structured patient pattern adds to a self-growing and -maintaining knowledge base, sharing the experience of physicians worldwide. Besides supporting diagnosis by relating the symptoms and signs with the final diagnosis recorded, the collective pattern map can also provide disease base-rate estimates and real-time surveillance for early detection of outbreaks. We explain how health care in resource-limited settings can benefit from using this approach and how it can be applied to provide feedback-rich medical education for both students and practitioners.",

        "Abstract": "The information needs of clinicians, as they interact with the EHR, are well-studied. Clinical researchers also interact with the EHR and, while they might be expected to have some similar needs, the unique needs that arise due to nature of their work remain largely unstudied. For clinicians, infobuttons (context-aware hyperlinks) provide a mechanism of studying these information needs. Here we describe the integration of infobuttons into i2b2, a popular data warehouse commonly used by clinical researchers, using a plugin. A preliminary survey of i2b2 developers suggests a general interest in infobuttons for i2b2 and indicates good likelihood for their deployment, where they may be used as a tool for further studying these needs in greater detail.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health records (EHR) are a vital data resource for research uses, including cohort identification, phenotyping, pharmacovigilance, and public health surveillance. To realize the promise of EHR data for accelerating clinical research, it is imperative to enable efficient and autonomous EHR data interrogation by end users such as biomedical researchers. This paper surveys state-of-art approaches and key methodological considerations to this purpose. We adapted a previously published conceptual framework for interactive information retrieval, which defines three entities: user, channel, and source, by elaborating on channels for query formulation in the context of facilitating end users to interrogate EHR data. We show the current progress in biomedical informatics mainly lies in support for query execution and information modeling, primarily due to emphases on infrastructure development for data integration and data access via self-service query tools, but has neglected user support needed during iteratively query formulation processes, which can be costly and error-prone. In contrast, the information science literature has offered elaborate theories and methods for user modeling and query formulation support. The two bodies of literature are complementary, implying opportunities for cross-disciplinary idea exchange. On this basis, we outline the directions for future informatics research to improve our understanding of user needs and requirements for facilitating autonomous interrogation of EHR data by biomedical researchers. We suggest that cross-disciplinary translational research between biomedical informatics and information science can benefit our research in facilitating efficient data access in life sciences.",

        "Abstract": "The corrections (\"stipulations\") to a proposed research study protocol produced by an institutional review board (IRB) can often be repetitive across many studies; however, there is no standard set of stipulations that could be used, for example, by researchers wishing to anticipate and correct problems in their research proposals prior to submitting to an IRB. The objective of the research was to computationally identify the most repetitive types of stipulations generated in the course of IRB deliberations. The text of each stipulation was normalized using the natural language processing techniques. An undirected weighted network was constructed in which each stipulation was represented by a node, and each link, if present, had weight corresponding to the TF-IDF Cosine Similarity of the stipulations. Network analysis software was then used to identify clusters in the network representing similar stipulations. The final results were correlated with additional data to produce further insights about the IRB workflow. From a corpus of 18,582 stipulations we identified 31 types of repetitive stipulations. Those types accounted for 3,870 stipulations (20.8% of the corpus) produced for 697 (88.7%) of all protocols in 392 (also 88.7%) of all the CNS IRB meetings with stipulations entered in our data source. A notable peroportion of the corrections produced by the IRB can be considered highly repetitive. Our shareable method relied on a minimal manual analysis and provides an intuitive exploration with theoretically unbounded granularity. Finer granularity allowed for the insight that is anticipated to prevent the need for identifying the IRB panel expertise or any human supervision.",

We have developed an approach that attempts to represent such phenotypic data in its most atomic form to facilitate aggregation. We illustrate this approach with human blood antigen typing (ABO-Rh) data drawn from the National Institutes of Health's Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS). In applying the method to actual patient data, we discovered a 2% incidence of changed blood types. We believe our approach can be applied to any institution's data to obtain comparable patient phenotypes. The actual discrepant blood type data will form the basis for a future study of the reasons for blood typing variation.",

        "Abstract": "Efficient communication of a clinical study protocol and case report forms during all stages of a human clinical study is important for many stakeholders. An electronic and structured study representation format that can be used throughout the whole study life-span can improve such communication and potentially lower total study costs. The most relevant standard for representing clinical study data, applicable to unregulated as well as regulated studies, is the Operational Data Model (ODM) in development since 1999 by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). ODM's initial objective was exchange of case report forms data but it is increasingly utilized in other contexts. An ODM extension called Study Design Model, introduced in 2011, provides additional protocol representation elements. Using a case study approach, we evaluated ODM's ability to capture all necessary protocol elements during a complete clinical study lifecycle in the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health. ODM offers the advantage of a single format for institutions that deal with hundreds or thousands of concurrent clinical studies and maintain a data warehouse for these studies. For each study stage, we present a list of gaps in the ODM standard and identify necessary vendor or institutional extensions that can compensate for such gaps. The current version of ODM (1.3.2) has only partial support for study protocol and study registration data mainly because it is outside the original development goal. ODM provides comprehensive support for representation of case report forms (in both the design stage and with patient level data). Inclusion of requirements of observational, non-regulated or investigator-initiated studies (outside Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation) can further improve future revisions of the standard.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical laboratory results are stored in electronic health records (EHRs) as structured data coded with local or standard terms. However, laboratory tests that are performed at outside laboratories are often simply labeled \"outside test\" or something similar, with the actual test name in a free-text result or comment field. After being aggregated into clinical data repositories, these ambiguous labels impede the retrieval of specific test results. We present a general multi-step solution that can facilitate the identification, standardization, reconciliation, and transformation of such test results. We applied our approach to data in the NIH Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS) to identify laboratory tests, map comment values to the LOINC codes that will be incorporated into our Research Entities Dictionary (RED), and develop a reference table that can be used in the EHR data extract-transform-load (ETL) process.",

        "Abstract": "We examined a large body of research study documents (protocols) to identify mentions of drug concepts and established base concepts and roles needed to characterize the semantics of these instances. We found these concepts in three general situations: background knowledge about the drug, study procedures involving the drug, and other roles of the drug in the study. We identified 18 more specific contexts (e.g., adverse event information, administration and dosing of the drug, and interactions between the study drug and other drugs). The ontology was validated against a test set of protocol documents from NIH and ClinicalTrial.gov. The goal is to support the automated extraction of drug information from protocol documents to support functions such as study retrieval, determination of subject eligibility, generation of order sets, and creation of logic for decision support alerts and reminders. Further work is needed to formally extend existing ontologies of clinical research.",

        "Abstract": "Personalized medicine, the ability to tailor diagnostic and treatment decisions for individual patients, is seen as the evolution of modern medicine. We characterize here the informatics resources available today or envisioned in the near future that can support clinical interpretation of genomic test results. We assume a clinical sequencing scenario (germline whole-exome sequencing) in which a clinical specialist, such as an endocrinologist, needs to tailor patient management decisions within his or her specialty (targeted findings) but relies on a genetic counselor to interpret off-target incidental findings. We characterize the genomic input data and list various types of knowledge bases that provide genomic knowledge for generating clinical decision support. We highlight the need for patient-level databases with detailed lifelong phenotype content in addition to genotype data and provide a list of recommendations for personalized medicine knowledge bases and databases. We conclude that no single knowledge base can currently support all aspects of personalized recommendations and that consolidation of several current resources into larger, more dynamic and collaborative knowledge bases may offer a future path forward.",

        "Abstract": "The American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI) sponsors periodic debates during the American Medical Informatics Fall Symposium to highlight important informatics issues of broad interest. In 2012, a panel debated the following topic: \"Resolved: Health Information Exchange Organizations Should Shift Their Principal Focus to Consumer-Mediated Exchange in Order to Facilitate the Rapid Development of Effective, Scalable, and Sustainable Health Information Infrastructure.\" Those supporting the proposition emphasized the need for consumer-controlled community repositories of electronic health records (health record banks) to address privacy, stakeholder cooperation, scalability, and sustainability. Those opposing the proposition emphasized that the current healthcare environment is so complex that development of consumer control will take time and that even then, consumers may not be able to mediate their information effectively. While privately each discussant recognizes that there are many sides to this complex issue, each followed the debater's tradition of taking an extreme position in order emphasize some of the polarizing aspects in the short time allotted them. In preparing this summary, we sought to convey the substance and spirit of the debate in printed form. Transcripts of the actual debate were edited for clarity, and appropriate supporting citations were added for the further edification of the reader.",

        "Abstract": "Each year thousands of patients die of avoidable medication errors. When a patient is admitted to, transferred within, or discharged from a clinical facility, clinicians should review previous medication orders, current orders and future plans for care, and reconcile differences if there are any. If medication reconciliation is not accurate and systematic, medication errors such as omissions, duplications, dosing errors, or drug interactions may occur and cause harm. Computer-assisted medication applications showed promise as an intervention to reduce medication summarization inaccuracies and thus avoidable medication errors. In this study, a computer-assisted medication summarization application, designed to abstract and represent multi-source time-oriented medication data, was introduced to assist clinicians with their medication reconciliation processes. An evaluation study was carried out to assess clinical usefulness and analyze potential impact of such application. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were applied to measure clinicians' performance efficiency and inaccuracy in medication summarization process with and without the intervention of computer-assisted medication application. Clinicians' feedback indicated the feasibility of integrating such a medication summarization tool into clinical practice workflow as a complementary addition to existing electronic health record systems. The result of the study showed potential to improve efficiency and reduce inaccuracy in clinician performance of medication summarization, which could in turn improve care efficiency, quality of care, and patient safety.",

        "Abstract": "In many institutions, data analysts use a Biomedical Query Mediation (BQM) process to facilitate data access for medical researchers. However, understanding of the BQM process is limited in the literature. To bridge this gap, we performed the initial steps of a cognitive task analysis using 31 BQM instances conducted between one analyst and 22 researchers in one academic department. We identified five top-level tasks, i.e., clarify research statement, explain clinical process, identify related data elements, locate EHR data element, and end BQM with either a database query or unmet, infeasible information needs, and 10 sub-tasks. We evaluated the BQM task model with seven data analysts from different clinical research institutions. Evaluators found all the tasks completely or semi-valid. This study contributes initial knowledge towards the development of a generalizable cognitive task representation for BQM.",

        "Abstract": "The \"Learning Health System\" has been described as an environment that drives research and innovation as a natural outgrowth of patient care. Electronic health records (EHRs) are necessary to enable the Learning Health System; however, a source of frustration is that current systems fail to adequately support research needs. We propose a model for enhancing EHRs to collect structured and standards-based clinical research data during clinical encounters that promotes efficiency and computational reuse of quality data for both care and research. The model integrates Common Data Elements (CDEs) for clinical research into existing clinical documentation workflows, leveraging executable documentation guidance within the EHR to support coordinated, standardized data collection for both patient care and clinical research.",

        "Abstract": "Data fragmentation within electronic health records causes gaps in the information readily available to clinicians. We investigated the information needs of emergency medicine clinicians in order to design an electronic dashboard to fill information gaps in the emergency department. An online survey was distributed to all emergency medicine physicians at a large, urban academic medical center. The survey response rate was 48% (52/109). The clinical information items reported to be most helpful while caring for patients in the emergency department were vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) reports, previous discharge summaries, and previous lab results. Brief structured interviews were also conducted with 18 clinicians during their shifts in the emergency department. From the interviews, three themes emerged: 1) difficulty accessing vital signs, 2) difficulty accessing point-of-care tests, and 3) difficulty comparing the current ECG with the previous ECG. An emergency medicine clinical dashboard was developed to address these difficulties.",

The heterogeneous nature of EHRs can complicate retrieval, risking incomplete results. We frame this problem as the presence of two gaps: 1) a gap between clinical concepts and their representations in EHR data and 2) a gap between data representations and their locations within EHR data structures. We bridge these gaps with a knowledge structure that comprises relationships among clinical concepts (including concepts of interest and concepts that may be instantiated in EHR data) and relationships between clinical concepts and the database structures. We make use of available knowledge resources to develop a reproducible, scalable process for creating a knowledge base that can support automated query expansion from a clinical concept to all relevant EHR data.",

These repositories now need to accommodate data coded with the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM). Database users wish to retrieve relevant data regardless of the system by which they are coded. We demonstrate how a terminology repository (the Research Entities Dictionary or RED) serves as an ontology relating terms of both ICD versions to each other to support seamless version-independent retrieval from the Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS) at the National Institutes of Health. We make use of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' General Equivalence Mappings (GEMs) to reduce the modeling effort required to determine whether ICD-10-CM terms should be added to the RED as new concepts or as synonyms of existing concepts. A divide-and-conquer approach is used to develop integration heuristics that offer a satisfactory interim solution and facilitate additional refinement of the integration as time and resources allow.",

To explore the functionality of Lifelines2, two markers of inflammation - erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) - were compared on patients both with and without the rare immune disorder chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) using ten years of de-identified patient data. We used Lifelines2 to visualize correlations among 12,266 laboratory events on 622 patients. The findings from our unrestricted sample identify areas warranting further studies on population subsets in which clinical features (such as disease activity) are known. Overall, visual aids such as Lifelines2 allowed for both rapid and powerful interpretation of EHR data.",

Thirty-one mediated query sessions for 22 research projects were recorded and transcribed. We analyzed 10 of these to develop an annotation schema for dialogue acts through iterative refinement. Three coders independently annotated all 3160 dialogue acts. We assessed the inter-rater agreement and resolved disagreement by group consensus. This study contributes early knowledge of the query negotiation space for medical research. We conclude that research data query formulation is not a straightforward translation from researcher data needs to database queries, but rather iterative, process-oriented needs assessment and refinement.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, an important public debate emerged about the digital afterlife of any personal data stored in the cloud. Such debate brings also to attention the importance of transparent management of electronic health record (EHR) data of deceased patients. In this perspective paper, we look at legal and regulatory policies for EHR data post mortem. We analyze observational research situations using EHR data that do not require institutional review board approval. We propose creation of a deceased subject integrated data repository (dsIDR) as an effective tool for piloting certain types of research projects. We highlight several dsIDR challenges in proving death status, informed consent, obtaining data from payers and healthcare providers and the involvement of next of kin.",

        "Abstract": "Clinicians' patient care information needs are frequent and largely unmet. Online knowledge resources are available that can help clinicians meet these information needs. Yet, significant barriers limit the use of these resources within the clinical workflow. Infobuttons are clinical decision support tools that use the clinical context (e.g., institution, user, patient) within electronic health record (EHR) systems to anticipate clinicians' questions and provide automated links to relevant information in knowledge resources. This paper describes OpenInfobutton (www.openinfobutton.org): a standards-based, open source Web service that was designed to disseminate infobutton capabilities in multiple EHR systems and healthcare organizations. OpenInfobutton has been successfully integrated with 38 knowledge resources at 5 large healthcare organizations in the United States. We describe the OpenInfobutton architecture, knowledge resource integration, and experiences at five large healthcare organizations.",

A new de-identified data query tool under development has been developed to support re-use of these data. We used a collection of 30 human-mediated user queries to determine whether features of the tool will be sufficient to allow users to carry out the queries themselves. The results show that the tool implemented in February 2013 will carry out a small percentage of user queries but the planned extensions will be sufficient for carrying out the majority of such queries. Future development of the tool will include extensions that correspond to the features found in human-mediated queries.",

        "Abstract": "One of the goals of translational science is to shorten the time from discovery to clinical use. Clinical trial registries were established to increase transparency in completed and ongoing clinical trials, and they support linking trials with resulting publications. We set out to investigate precision and negative predictive value (NPV) of links between ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov) and PubMed. CT.gov has been established to increase transparency in clinical trials and the link to PubMed is crucial for supporting a number of important functions, including ascertaining publication bias. We drew a random sample of trials downloaded from CT.gov and performed manual review of retrieved publications. We characterize two types of links between trials and publications (NCT-link originating from MEDLINE and PMID-link originating from CT.gov).The link precision is different based on type (NCT-link: 100%; PMID-link: 63% to 96%). In trials with no linked publication, we were able to find publications 44% of the time (NPV=56%) by searching PubMed. This low NPV shows that there are potentially numerous publications that should have been formally linked with the trials. Our results indicate that existing trial registry and publisher policies may not be fully enforced. We suggest some automated methods for improving link quality.",

Two freely available resources make infobutton implementation possible for virtually any EHR system. OpenInfobutton is an HL7-compliant system that accepts context parameters from an EHR and, using its knowledge base of resources and information needs, generates a set of links that direct the user to relevant information. The Librarian Infobutton Tailoring Environment (LITE) is a second system that allows institutional librarians to specify which resources should be selected in a given context by OpenInfobutton. This paper describes the steps needed to use LITE to customize OpenInfobutton and to integrate OpenInfobutton into an EHR.",

        "Abstract": "There is an increasing amount of clinical data in operational electronic health record (EHR) systems. Such data provide substantial opportunities for their re-use for many purposes, including comparative effectiveness research (CER). In a previous paper, we identified a number of caveats related to the use of such data, noting that they may be inaccurate, incomplete, transformed in ways that undermine their meaning, unrecoverable for research, of unknown provenance, of insufficient granularity, or incompatible with research protocols. In this paper, we provide recommendations for overcoming these caveats with the goal of leveraging such data to benefit CER and other health care activities. These recommendations include adaptation of \"best evidence\" approaches to use of data; processes to evaluate availability, completeness, quality, and transformability of data; creation of tools to manage data and their attributes; determination of metrics for assessing whether data are \"research grade\"; development of methods for comparative validation of data; construction of a methodology database for methods involving use of clinical data; standardized reporting methods for data and their attributes; appropriate use of informatics expertise; and a research agenda to determine biases inherent in operational data and to assess informatics approaches to their improvement.",

        "Abstract": "Point-of-care information needs are common and frequently unmet. One solution to this problem is the use of Infobuttons, which are context-sensitive links from electronic health records (EHR) to knowledge resources, sometimes involving an intermediate broker known as an Infobutton Manager. Health Level Seven (HL7) has developed the Context-Aware Knowledge Retrieval (Infobutton) standard to standardize the integration between EHR systems and knowledge resources. While the standard specifies a set of context attributes and standard terminologies, it leaves to knowledge resources the flexibility to decide how to use these attributes and terminologies to retrieve the most relevant content. This paper describes some of the challenges faced by knowledge resources in trying to locate the most relevant content based on the attribute values for a given Infobutton request. Various approaches to content retrieval are discussed, including the role of indexing with standardized codes, the role of text-based search engines together with their ranking algorithms, and the role of hybrid approaches. Knowledge resource developers must carefully consider business rules, heuristics, and precision/recall tradeoffs when implementing the HL7 Infobutton standard.",

This application involves many technologies currently being researched, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), information retrieval (IR), and summarization, all in the biomedical domain. In certain domains, the problem of spoken document retrieval has been declared solved because of the robustness of IR to ASR errors. This study investigates the extent to which spoken medical question answering benefits from that same robustness. We used the best results from previous speech recognition experiments as inputs to a clinical question answering system, and had physicians perform blind evaluations of results generated both by ASR transcripts of questions and gold standard transcripts of the same questions. Our results suggest that the medical domain differs enough from the open domain to require additional work in automatic speech recognition adapted for the biomedical domain.",

        "Abstract": "The current volume and complexity of genetic tests, and the molecular genetics knowledge and health knowledge related to interpretation of the results of those tests, are rapidly outstripping the ability of individual clinicians to recall, understand and convey to their patients information relevant to their care. The tailoring of molecular genetics knowledge and health knowledge in clinical settings is important both for the provision of personalized medicine and to reduce clinician information overload. In this paper we describe the incorporation, customization and demonstration of molecular genetic data (mainly sequence variants), molecular genetics knowledge and health knowledge into a standards-based electronic health record (EHR) prototype developed specifically for this study.",

        "Abstract": "Most existing controlled terminologies can be characterized as collections of terms, wherein the terms are arranged in a simple list or organized in a hierarchy. These kinds of terminologies are considered useful for standardizing terms and encoding data and are currently used in many existing information systems. However, they suffer from a number of limitations that make data reuse difficult. Relatively recently, it has been proposed that formal ontological methods can be applied to some of the problems of terminological design. Biomedical ontologies organize concepts (embodiments of knowledge about biomedical reality) whereas terminologies organize terms (what is used to code patient data at a certain point in time, based on the particular terminology version). However, the application of these methods to existing terminologies is not straightforward. The use of these terminologies is firmly entrenched in many systems, and what might seem to be a simple option of replacing these terminologies is not possible. Moreover, these terminologies evolve over time in order to suit the needs of users. Any methodology must therefore take these constraints into consideration, hence the need for formal methods of managing changes. Along these lines, we have developed a formal representation of the concept-term relation, around which we have also developed a methodology for management of terminology changes. The objective of this study was to determine whether our methodology would result in improved retrieval of data.",

Unique aspects of the system includes a Research Entities Dictionary that unifies all controlled terminologies used by source systems and a hybrid data model that unifies parts of the source data models and include other data in entity-attribute value tables. BTRIS currently includes over 300 million rows of data, from three institutes, ranging from 1976 to present.

        "Abstract": "Biological ontologies are now being widely used for annotation, sharing and retrieval of the biological data. Many of these ontologies are hosted under the umbrella of the Open Biological Ontologies Foundry. In order to support interterminology mapping, composite terms in these ontologies need to be translated into atomic or primitive terms in other, orthogonal ontologies, for example, gluconeogenesis (biological process term) to glucose (chemical ontology term). Identifying such decompositional ontology translations is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a network-theoretic approach based on the structure of the integrated OBO relationship graph. We use a network-theoretic measure, called the clustering coefficient, to find relevant atomic terms in the neighborhood of a composite term. By eliminating the existing GO to ChEBI Ontology mappings from OBO, we evaluate whether the proposed approach can re-identify the corresponding relationships. The results indicate that the network structure provides strong cues for decompositional ontology translation and the existing relationships can be used to identify new translations.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this evaluation was to determine the effect of redesigning the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) telemedicine architecture on the average upload delay and on the average number of glucose uploads to a central database. These two measures positively influence our ability to deliver timely and accurate patient care to the study population. The redesign was also undertaken to improve the patients' experience in using the system and thereby increase the frequency and timeliness of their self-monitoring behavior. Using the total number of glucose uploads, we compared the delay in glucose upload times according to the type of home telemedicine unit the study participants used and the region where the participants lived. The participants were Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes living in medically underserved neighborhoods in New York City and rural Upstate New York. The populations in these two regions differed considerably in terms of ethnicity, language spoken (Spanish, English), and education level. Participants who had Generation 2 (Gen 2) (mean = 10.75, SD +/- 7.96) home telemedicine units had significantly shorter upload delay times (p < 0.001) as measured in days than those participants with Generation 1 (Gen 1) (mean = 22.44, SD +/- 11.18) and those who were upgraded from Gen 1 (mean = 20.67, SD +/- 8.85) to Gen 2 (mean = 14.93, SD +/- 9.37). Additionally, the delay was significantly shorter for participants living upstate (mean = 24.14 days, SD +/- 11.95 days) than downstate (mean = 15.30 days, SD +/- 7.87 days), t (975) = 13.98, p < 0.01. The system redesign made a significant impact in reducing glucose upload delays of IDEATel participants. However, upload delays were significantly impacted by the region where the participants resided.",

        "Abstract": "Although controlled biomedical terminologies have been with us for centuries, it is only in the last couple of decades that close attention has been paid to the quality of these terminologies. The result of this attention has been the development of auditing methods that apply formal methods to assessing whether terminologies are complete and accurate. We have performed an extensive literature review to identify published descriptions of these methods and have created a framework for characterizing them. The framework considers manual, systematic and heuristic methods that use knowledge (within or external to the terminology) to measure quality factors of different aspects of the terminology content (terms, semantic classification, and semantic relationships). The quality factors examined included concept orientation, consistency, non-redundancy, soundness and comprehensive coverage. We reviewed 130 studies that were retrieved based on keyword search on publications in PubMed, and present our assessment of how they fit into our framework. We also identify which terminologies have been audited with the methods and provide examples to illustrate each part of the framework.",

        "Abstract": "The Medical Entities Dictionary (MED) has served as a unified terminology at New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University for more than 20 years. It was initially created to allow the clinical data from the disparate information systems (e.g., radiology, pharmacy, and multiple laboratories, etc.) to be uniquely codified for storage in a single data repository, and functions as a real time terminology server for clinical applications and decision support tools. Being conceived as a knowledge base, the MED incorporates relationships among local terms, between local terms and external standards, and additional knowledge about terms in a semantic network structure. Over the past two decades, we have sought to develop methods to maintain, audit and improve the content of the MED, such that it remains true to its original design goals. This has resulted in a complex, multi-faceted process, with both manual and automated components. In this paper, we describe this process, with examples of its effectiveness. We believe that our process provides lessons for others who seek to maintain complex, concept-oriented controlled terminologies.",

A key part of the caBIG architecture is the establishment of terminology standards for representing data. In order to evaluate the suitability of existing controlled terminologies, the caBIG Vocabulary and Data Elements Workspace (VCDE WS) working group has developed a set of criteria that serve to assess a terminology's structure, content, documentation, and editorial process. This paper describes the evolution of these criteria and the results of their use in evaluating four standard terminologies: the Gene Ontology (GO), the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt), the Common Terminology for Adverse Events (known as CTCAE), and the laboratory portion of the Logical Objects, Identifiers, Names and Codes (LOINC). The resulting caBIG criteria are presented as a matrix that may be applicable to any terminology standardization effort.",

We prospectively studied the efficacy of a new alert to infer errors in previously stored data and to decrease the frequency of data entry errors, in an attempt to improve the quality of data for clinical trials. For the purpose of this study, we monitored data entry errors in height or weight measurements. We predetermined the criteria for probable error as a ten percent variance from a patient's reference value. The care provider entering a value satisfying our error criteria received a disruptive pop-up alert message. The study revealed a significant decrease in the frequency of data errors stored in the EHR, from 2.4% before the alert to 0.9% after the alert. These findings have implications for the development of clinical research trial data collection support tools.",

        "Abstract": "The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) integrates knowledge from several biomedical terminologies. One of the important sources of knowledge is the set of semantic relationships asserted between the concepts derived from different source terminologies. Such integration of multiple sources of terminological knowledge can potentially enable discovery of implicit meaningful relationships between the concepts (unrelated at a given time). In this research we explore whether the existing knowledge in the UMLS in the form of semantics (types or categories) and structure (network topology) can be used to discover potential relationships. In this paper, we propose a problem-independent approach to discover potential terminological relationships by semantic abstraction of transitive relationship paths to perform classification and analyzing network theoretic measures such as topological overlap and average number of transitive paths. Using different versions of the UMLS, we evaluate the proposed approach over newly added relationships. Strong discriminative characteristics were observed with semantic abstraction based classifier (area under curve of 0.96) and average number of transitive paths (t[198]=−4.19, p<0.001) to identify potential relationships. The UMLS has sufficient knowledge to enable discovery of potential terminological relationships.",

When searching for information related to orders one search term might retrieve documents related to multiple orders. We clustered nursing orders into sets that are related by the same logical clinical context. We then generated clusters and their search terms from a data set of 636 orders obtained from a CIS/CPOE system at an academic medical center. We refined those cluster search terms by searching an electronic nursing procedure manual to retrieve resources that could answer one of six generic nursing questions. Sixty-three cluster search terms were identified. The search terms for 100 (16%) of the orders were validated in a second hospitals electronic nursing procedure manual; precision was 32.5%.. Our process of identifying cluster search terms may be a useful method to obtain clinically relevant information resources.",

We are interested in ways to increase use of context-specific links, called infobuttons, from clinical information systems to such resources. We used log files to examine the impact of classroom instruction on infobutton use to pinpoint a particular context where infobuttons appeared to be underused by particular users. We sent users e-mail suggestions about infobuttons and reviewed log files to examine the impact of the messages. Log files showed that usage by medical students and housestaff following classroom instruction was initially high but then tapered off. In particular, we found that infobuttons were infrequently used in an outpatient, but not inpatient, medication application. We sent 552 suggestion e-mails to 371 users after log files showed that they used other resources in that context. Fifty-two of these users used infobuttons within 31 days of receiving the e-mail, which represents 25.9% of recipients who used any resource during the same period. Users responded best when the e-mail was sent within 5 days of using the resource. Traditional instruction had a limited sustained effect on improving the use of infobuttons. An automated method for sending targeted suggestions complemented the traditional approach.",

Infobuttons have been around for over 15 years but are only recently finding wide-spread adoption, with various \"infobutton managers\", and infobutton-like projects being developed at several academic medical centers. Vendors of electronic health records systems have begun working with vendors of knowledge resources to create \"infobutton access\" methods for communicating from the former to the latter. In response to this increased interest, and the attendant need to standardize communication between clinical systems and infobutton managers and between infobutton managers and knowledge resources, Health Level 7 (HL7) is developing a standard message structure for exchange contextual information and information-needs requests. At least one project is underway to develop a tailoring environment that can be used by health librarians to customize infobutton managers for use at their own institutions, with their own users, and their preferred knowledge resources.",

        "Abstract": "To effectively meet clinician information needs at the point of care, we must understand how their needs are dependent on both context and clinician type. The Infobutton Manager (IM), accessed through a clinical information system, anticipates the clinician's questions and provides links to pertinent electronic resources. We conducted an observational usefulness case study of medical residents (MDs), nurse practitioners (NPs), registered nurses (RNs), and a physician assistant (PA), using the IM in a laboratory setting. Generic question types and success rates for each clinician's information needs were characterized. Question type frequency differed by clinician type. All clinician types asked for institution-specific protocols. The MDs asked about unfamiliar domains, RNs asked about physician order rationales, and NPs asked questions similar to both MDs and RNs. Observational data suggest that IM success rates may be improved by tailoring anticipated questions to clinician type. Clinicians reported that a more visible Infobutton may increase use.",

Along these lines, we have developed a formal representation of the concept-term relationship, around which we have also developed a methodology for management of terminology changes. We have implemented our methodology in a terminology maintenance tool. To evaluate our methodology, we compared two methods for retrieving ICD-9-CM data, based on their recall when retrieving data for ICD-9-CM terms whose codes had changed but which had retained their original meaning. Our results show that recall is either the same or better with a retrieval method that takes into account the effects of terminology. Statistically significant differences were detected (p<0.05) with the McNemar test for two terms whose codes had changed. Furthermore, when all the cases are combined in an overall category, our method 2 also performs statistically significantly better than default method 1 (p < 0.05).",

        "Abstract": "Biomedical terminologies often contain composite concepts that cannot be translated into single unique synonymous concepts in a target controlled terminology. Such composite concepts need to be decomposed into sets of component concepts present in the target terminology that can serve as the proxy for applications in information retrieval, decision support or data analysis. Towards this goal, we use a \"clustering coefficient\" over the UMLS Metathesaurus to traverse the closely clustered neighbors of the composite source concept to generate a ranked list of possible component concepts. Using the MeSH Associated Expression mappings as the gold-standard, we show that the proposed approach generates relevant component concepts as compared to existing semantic locality based methods. The topological connectivity of the concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus is a useful feature that can be coupled with existing lexical and semantic locality based approaches towards terminology translation.",

The resources range from local documents, to commercially available document sets and search engines. The links provided by the IM can be reliably created, but there is no guarantee that they will function reliably, since the resources to which they point are subject to unannounced changes and failures. We have developed a set of tools to audit the links periodically to determine if the resources are available and if the IM has sufficient information to generate all the links needed by its users. These tools have been in use since February, 2006 and have provided timely warnings on many occasions. These warnings have allowed us to correct problems with resource access before they became apparent to our users and often before the resource maintainers were aware of the problems. The tools have thus helped us provide clinicians with a dependable level of service.",

When integrating a new source, the source terms already in the UMLS must first be found. The easiest approach to this is simple string matching. However, string matching usually does not find all concepts that should be found. A new methodology, based on the notion of piecewise synonyms, for enhancing the process of concept discovery in the UMLS is presented. This methodology is supported by first creating a general synonym dictionary based on the UMLS. Each multi-word source term is decomposed into its component words, allowing for the generation of separate synonyms for each word from the general synonym dictionary. The recombination of these synonyms into new terms creates an expanded pool of matching candidates for terms from the source. The methodology is demonstrated with respect to an existing UMLS source. It shows a 34% improvement over simple string matching.",

The success of answering an information need through an automated Infobutton relies on the program's ability to anticipate a clinician's question. This study's six process methodology aims to meet context-specific information needs related to clinical information system (CIS) nursing orders. Context-specific questions were derived from nurse generic questions generated from nurse focus group data, observational data, and an established taxonomy. The context-specific questions, were filtered by nursing order semantic type within a logical clinical context cluster (LCCC), which is a clinical association identified from the nurse perspective. Nursing orders of the same semantic type are associated with similar types of nurse information needs and are used to assess Internet-based resources for the capability to answer those information needs. LCCCs help identify resources and CIS areas ripe for an Infobutton.",

My research characterizes these needs in order to build information systems that can help clinicians get timely answers to their questions. My colleagues and I have developed \"Infobuttons\", which are links between clinical information systems and on-line knowledge resources, and have developed an \"Infobutton Manager\" (IM) that attempts to determine the information need based on the context of what the user is doing. The IM presents users with a set of questions, each of which is a link to an online information resource that will answer the question. The Infobutton Manager has been successfully deployed in five systems at four institutions and provides users with over 1,000 accesses to on-line health information each month, with a positive impact on patient care.",

        "Abstract": "Despite public health initiatives targeting rapid action in response to symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI), people continue to delay in going to a hospital when experiencing these symptoms due to lack of recognition as cardiac-related. The objective of this research was to characterize lay individuals' knowledge of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and associated decision processes for timely action. Thirty participants were interviewed about their knowledge of AMI, then presented with unrelated, unfamiliar and familiar scenarios of AMI symptoms and instructed to \"think aloud\" as they made decisions in response to the scenarios in order to capture the decision process directly. Data were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods to identify the semantic relationships between knowledge and decisions. Results showed that most participants (80%) identified three symptoms or less (e.g., chest pain: 93%; dyspnea: 53%). All participants identified urgent actions (calling 911, going to ED) as the appropriate response to AMI symptoms. Urgent action decisions increased with familiarity of symptoms (57% for unrelated symptoms to 83% for most familiar symptoms), and was highest for the cardiac group. Lay knowledge of AMI is necessary, but not sufficient for people to develop required heuristics for timely action. This ineffective decision increases as a function of ambiguous and unfamiliar situations. Health education interventions should focus on teaching clusters of problems with varying levels of familiarity and complexity to increase flexibility in making decisions.",

        "Abstract": "Interest in studying distractions and interruptions in the context of clinician workflow has increased in light of evidence that these events may negatively impact patient safety. Additionally, many recent informatics-based studies analyze computer provider order entry (CPOE) and clinical information system (CIS) implementation and its effects on clinician workflow. This study expands the development and use of a taxonomy to characterize distractions to clinicians and their subsequent actions in the context of CPOE/CIS use. We found a total of 75 distracting events in 406 minutes of observational data of which 32 led to interruptions and 30 led to continued multitasking. The above primary actions led to 5 tasks not completed and 4 episodes of clinician's lack of recall. Differences in the distribution of the source of distractions and primary action of the distracted clinicians may be a function of clinical setting and clinician type using the CPOE/CIS. Nine secondary actions, potentially resulting in a slip or a mistake, suggest that CPOE may necessitate different forms of safety nets than traditional clinician communication.",

        "Abstract": "The UMLS Metathesaurus belongs to the class of scale-free networks with few concept hubs possessing a large number of relationships. The hubs provide useful links between the concepts from disparate terminologies in the UMLS; however, they also exponentially increase the number of possible transitive cross-terminology paths. Towards the goal of using machine learning to rank cross-terminology translations, we propose a traversal algorithm that exploits the scale-free property of the UMLS to reduce the number of candidate translations. We characterize the concept hubs into \"informational\" and \"noisy\" concept hubs and provide an automated method to detect them. Using gold standard mappings from SNOMED-CT to ICD9CM, we found an average 20-fold reduction in the number of candidate mappings while achieving comparable recall and ranking results. A hub-driven traversal strategy provides a promising approach to generate high quality cross-terminology translations from the UMLS.",

We have developed a method in which medication information (consisting of both coded data and narrative text) is extracted from twelve sources from two clinical information systems and assembled into a chronological sequence of medication history, plans, and orders that correspond to periods before, during and after a hospital admission. We use natural language processing, a controlled terminology, and a medication classification system to create matrices that can be used to determine the initiation, changes and discontinuation of medications over time. We applied the process to a set of 17 patient records and successfully abstracted and summarized the medication data. This approach has implications for efforts to improve medication history-taking, order entry, and automated auditing of patient records for quality assurance.",

The purpose of this study was to explore the decision-making capacity of elderly, terminally ill patients and the psychological and physical factors that affect decision making. Decision-making capacity and cognitive abilities were assessed using four measures: the Hopkins Competency Assessment Kit, the Bechara Gambling Task, the Concept Assessment Kit, and the Mini Mental Status Exam. In addition, symptoms of depression, level of physical functioning, and extent of physical symptoms were evaluated in order to identify correlates of decision-making ability. Two samples were compared: elderly, terminally ill patients with cancer (n = 43) and elderly, physically healthy adults living in supportive community residence (n = 35). Results revealed significantly poorer decision-making abilities among the terminal ill sample compared with healthy comparisons, but no association between demographic variables (e.g., age, race, or education) or clinical variables (depression or physical symptoms) and decision making. Implications for evaluating decision-making capacity are addressed.",

        "Abstract": "The published medical literature and online medical resources are important sources to help physicians make patient treatment decisions. Traditional sources used for information retrieval (e.g., PubMed) often return a list of documents in response to a user's query. Frequently the number of returned documents from large knowledge repositories is large and makes information seeking practical only \"after hours\" and not in the clinical setting. This study developed novel algorithms, and designed, implemented, and evaluated a medical definitional question answering system (MedQA). MedQA automatically analyzed a large number of electronic documents to generate short and coherent answers in response to definitional questions (i.e., questions with the format of \"What is X?\"). Our preliminary cognitive evaluation shows that MedQA out-performed three other online information systems (Google, OneLook, and PubMed) in two important efficiency criteria; namely, time spent and number of actions taken for a physician to identify a definition. It is our contention that question answering systems that aggregate pertinent information scattered across different documents have the potential to address clinical information needs within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of clinicians.",

Information retrieval systems (e.g., PubMed) typically return a list of documents in response to a user's query. Frequently the number of returned documents is large and makes physicians' information seeking \"practical only 'after hours' and not in the clinical settings\". Question answering techniques are based on automatically analyzing thousands of electronic documents to generate short-text answers in response to clinical questions that are posed by physicians. The authors address physicians' information needs and described the design, implementation, and evaluation of the medical question answering system (MedQA). Although our long term goal is to enable MedQA to answer all types of medical questions, currently, we implemented MedQA to integrate information retrieval, extraction, and summarization techniques to automatically generate paragraph-level text for definitional questions (i.e., \"What is X?\"). MedQA can be accessed at http://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/~yuh9001/research/MedQA.html.",

        "Abstract": "Information needs studies in clinical settings often face the problem of integrating and analyzing data collected using different study tools. Generally, a coding taxonomy or a model is developed to capture and code the study data. Significant efforts are required to develop a model that not only captures the study data but is also closer to the clinical domain to draw meaningful real world inferences. Further, a study-specific model limits comparative evaluation of studies across different institutions. In this paper, we propose a reference model for representing nursing information needs. We use an iterative and collaborative approach in representing the concepts in the model. The model consists of 33 information (need) concepts, 29 information sources and 7 categories of nursing tasks which were used to code 228 identified information need instances.",

        "Abstract": "Many studies have found that clinicians require access to medical knowledge sources while viewing data in their patients' health records. To address this need, we have been developing links to various on-line health information resources from our Web-based clinical information system (WebCIS). Clinicians can access these resources through a \"Health Resources\" Web page or use context-sensitive \"infobuttons\" that automatically link to specific resources. To assist in understanding how clinicians interact with these two mechanisms, we have been exploring the use of an automated approach to answer questions about usage for guiding the further development of links to resources. In this paper, we discuss the use of a knowledge discovery technique (CIS Usage Mining) to obtain usage statistics from log files that record interactions with health resources and infobuttons in WebCIS, describe a Web-based interface developed to present the results, and summarize how the results could be applied. The availability of effective links to on-line medical knowledge sources from the patient health record can assist in resolving information needs, potentially improving patient care and decision-making.",

        "Abstract": "Fall and injury prevention continues to be a challenge in the acute care environment. Identification of patients at risk can guide preventive care for these individuals. The following study employed usability engineering methods via a series of focus groups, to specify functional and design requirements for an automated Fall-Injury Risk Assessment Instrument. Focus groups were held with interdisciplinary decision makers and end-users to identify functional and design specifications for the automated instrument. The results were mapped to usability heuristics, which were used to guide design decisions. The main elements identified were data completeness, workflow processes, resource access, and cognitive burden. The main usability factors identified were efficiency of user, match with real world, error prevention, recognition not recall and minimalist design. Focus groups are a useful methodology to specify requirements for healthcare applications. Outcomes evaluation of the automated instrument is in process.",

        "Abstract": "A 1998 paper that delineated desirable characteristics, or desiderata for controlled medical terminologies attempted to summarize emerging consensus regarding structural issues of such terminologies. Among the Desiderata was a call for terminologies to be \"concept oriented.\" Since then, research has trended toward the extension of terminologies into ontologies. A paper by Smith, entitled \"From Concepts to Clinical Reality: An Essay on the Benchmarking of Biomedical Terminologies\" urges a realist approach that seeks terminologies composed of universals, rather than concepts. The current paper addresses issues raised by Smith and attempts to extend the Desiderata, not away from concepts, but towards recognition that concepts and universals must both be embraced and can coexist peaceably in controlled terminologies. To that end, additional Desiderata are defined that deal with the purpose, rather than the structure, of controlled medical terminologies.",

The traditional manual method of developing terminology models is time-consuming and limited in the number of phrases that a human developer can examine. In this paper, we present an automated method for developing medical terminology models based on natural language processing (NLP) and information visualization techniques. Surgical pathology reports were selected as the testing corpus for developing a pathology procedure terminology model. The use of a general NLP processor for the medical domain, MedLEE, provides an automated method for acquiring semantic structures from a free text corpus and sheds light on a new high-throughput method of medical terminology model development. The use of an information visualization technique supports the summarization and visualization of the large quantity of semantic structures generated from medical documents. We believe that a general method based on NLP and information visualization will facilitate the modeling of medical terminologies.",

        "Abstract": "Online medical information, when presented to clinicians, must be well-organized and intuitive to use, so that the clinicians can conduct their daily work efficiently and without error. It is essential to actively seek to produce good user interfaces that are acceptable to the user. This paper describes the methodology used to develop a simplified heuristic evaluation (HE) suitable for the evaluation of screen shots of Web pages, the development of an HE instrument used to conduct the evaluation, and the results of the evaluation of the aforementioned screen shots. In addition, this paper presents examples of the process of categorizing problems identified by the HE and the technological solutions identified to resolve these problems. Four usability experts reviewed 18 paper-based screen shots and made a total of 108 comments. Each expert completed the task in about an hour. We were able to implement solutions to approximately 70% of the violations. Our study found that a heuristic evaluation using paper-based screen shots of a user interface was expeditious, inexpensive, and straightforward to implement.",

        "Abstract": "This report provides an evaluation of the National Library of Medicine-sponsored Woods Hole Medical Informatics (WHMI) course and the extent to which the objectives of the program are achieved. Two studies were conducted to examine the participants' perceptions of both the short-term (spring 2002) and the long-term influences (1993 through 2002) on knowledge, skills, and behavior. Data were collected through the use of questionnaires, semistructured telephone interviews, and participant observation methods to provide both quantitative and qualitative assessment. The participants of the spring 2002 course considered the course to be an excellent opportunity to increase their knowledge and understanding of the field of medical informatics as well as to meet and interact with other professionals in the field to establish future collaborations. Past participants remained highly satisfied with their experience at Woods Hole and its influence on their professional careers and their involvement in a broad range of activities related to medical informatics. This group considered their knowledge and understanding of medical informatics to be of greater quality, had increased their networking with other professionals, and were more confident and motivated to work in the field. Many of the participants feel and show evidence of becoming effective agents of change in their institutions in the area of medical informatics, which is one of the objectives of the program.",

        "Abstract": "The potential for informatics solutions to address inpatient safety issues is significant; however, several challenges are associated with the development of patient safety related informatics applications. These challenges include: 1) the identification and/or development of valid and reliable instruments; 2) adequate representation of key safety concepts, constructs, and associated concepts in the clinical information system; and 3) identification of data sources for instrument pre-population. As part of a larger project aimed at identifying and addressing the information needs of clinicians while using a clinical information system, an electronic fall and injury risk assessment instrument is in development to address a hospital-based fall and injury prevention initiative. The concepts contained in the instrument are well represented by Clinical LOINC and the UMLS. Associated concepts have been identified in the existing clinical information system data dictionary for pre-population of the instrument.",

We have investigated an approach based on the minimum number of parent links between concepts, and evaluated its performance relative to human expert estimates on three sets of concepts for three terminologies within the UMLS (i.e., MeSH, ICD9CM, and SNOMED). The resulting quantitative metric enables computer-based applications that use decision thresholds and approximate matching criteria. The proposed conceptual matching supports problem solving and inferencing (using high-level, generic concepts) based on readily available data (typically represented as low-level, specific concepts). Through the identification of semantically similar concepts, conceptual matching also enables reasoning in the absence of exact, or even approximate, lexical matching. Finally, conceptual matching is relevant for terminology development and maintenance, machine learning research, decision support system development, and data mining research in biomedical informatics and other fields.",

        "Abstract": "Medical errors are often associated with inadequate cognitive processing that is based upon impaired access to information.1 Understanding the information needs of nurses and physicians' when using a clinical information system (CIS) is difficult largely because there are few systematic attempts made to do so. We collected 15.5 hours of data of nurses and physicians' CIS interactions in three clinical environments (cardiac ICU, a general medical/surgical nursing, and an ambulatory clinic). We accomplished this through observational, cognitive-based methods (e.g., thinking aloud during interaction) and the video capturing of events with a portable usability laboratory.2 We developed a systematic approach to identify and define in-context clinical information needs while using a CIS, and determine how to categorize and code such events. 3",

        "Abstract": "Attempts to link clinical information systems to on-line information resources date back over a decade. The World Wide Web presents new opportunities to create such links, which we refer to as \"infobuttons\". This capability is partly due to the ease with which a link (called a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL) in one Web-based system can take users to another Web-based system, and partly due to the proliferation of high-quality Web-based resources. Typically, contextual information from the clinical system (such as patient data) is passed to a search engine that is evoked and, in turn, presents search results to the user. Impediments to infobutton development include customized programming to pass context information to the information resource, lack of standards for types and values of context information, variability of search engine interfaces, and a lack of understanding of clinicians' information needs. We are addressing these limitations with an Infobutton Manager (IM) that provides a standardized interface for matching user contexts to information resources.",

        "Abstract": "Inadequate access to patient information at the point of care has been identified as an impediment to the health care process. To create clinical computing tools that are useful to and used by clinicians, developers of clinical information systems must have accurate models of the users for whom their systems are intended. To create these models, the information needs of clinicians must be understood. While the wireless handheld environment offers many advantages such as the ability to provide mobile access to information, there are a number of challenges. Developing for this environment differs from the laptop and desktop environments due to features such as processing power, screen size, input mechanism, and bandwidth. PalmCIS (Palm-based Clinical Information System) is a clinical application being developed at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) that provides clinicians with access to patient data via a wireless handheld device. We are using an automated technique to uncover patient-specific information needs of clinicians while using a patient record system. With the results, we can enhance PalmCIS.",

This can lead to quicker access to desired information, which may facilitate the decision-making process. Qualitative methods such as interviews, observations and surveys have been commonly used to gain an understanding of clinician information needs. We introduce clinical information system (CIS) log analysis as a method for identifying patient-specific information needs and CIS log mining as an automated technique for discovering such needs in CIS log files. We have applied this method to WebCIS (Web-based Clinical Information System) log files to discover patterns of usage. The results can be used to guide design and development of relevant clinical information systems. This paper discusses the motivation behind the development of this method, describes CIS log analysis and mining, presents preliminary results and summarizes how the results can be applied.",

In response to these findings, the authors have been developing extensions to their Web-based clinical information system including PalmCIS, an application that provides access to needed patient information via a wireless personal digital assistant (PDA). The focus was on achieving end-to-end security and developing a highly usable system. This report discusses the motivation behind PalmCIS, design and development of the system, and future directions.",

        "Abstract": "I believe the standard for making ethical decisions should be the same for all patients: appropriate medical interventions, carefully weighing their benefits and burdens, and trying to honor the wishes of the patients. When cure is not possible, the balance between benefits and burdens should shift to greater consideration of the burden side of the equation. The ascendancy of autonomy over other medical ethical principles is the center for most of the ethical dilemmas encountered in palliative care. This paper discusses the issues of autonomy, informed consent, patient capacity, advance directives, futility, \"do-not-resuscitate\" orders, withholding or withdrawing interventions, euthanasia, and sedation therapy. After 41 years of my personally caring for over 4000 terminally ill patients, primarily at Calvary Hospital, the most practical approach has been to establish trust with patients and families, determining their goals, and diligently applying the principles of beneficence (benefits) and nonmaleficence (burdens) in everyday practice.",

We sought to study the character and impact of such access to determine how patients use such records, what cognitive effects it has on them, and how it affects their relationship with their health care providers. We created the Patient Clinical Information System (PatCIS) to interface with the clinical data repository at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) to allow patients to add to and review their medical data. We also provided educational resources and automated advice programs. We provided access to the system to thirteen subjects over a 36-month period and reviewed their activities in the system's usage log. We also collected data via questionnaire and telephone interview. We collected data for a total of 223 patient months. We found that patients varied in their use of the system, from once a month or less to one or more times per day. All patients primarily used the system to review laboratory results. Both they and their physicians believed that use of the system enhanced the patients' understanding of their conditions and improved their communication with their physicians. There were no adverse events encountered during the study.",

        "Abstract": "The Unified Medical Language System's (UMLS's) Semantic Network (SN)---consisting of a network of semantic types---has a two-tree structure, where each semantic type has at most one parent semantic type. This arrangement is restrictive because some semantic types are, by their definition, specializations of several parents. As a proposed enhancement to the SN, its semantic types have previously been partitioned into groups, each of which contains semantic types of some specific area. However, some groups of this proposed partition contain forest (i.e., multiple-tree) structures or even isolated semantic types. Both situations imply a disconnected internal structure. Connectivity is actually one way to assess the proposed \"semantic validity\" principle for partitions. It is a desired, although not required, property. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for identifying \"missing\" IS-A links and adding them to the SN. This process transforms the SN into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, with semantic types permitted to have multiple parents. A result of our methodology is the transformation of the proposed SN partition into groups satisfying the connectivity property.",

        "Abstract": "Too often, online searches for health information are time consuming and produce results that are not sufficiently precise to answer clinicians' or patients' questions. The PERSIVAL project is designed to circumvent this problem by personalizing and tailoring searches and presentation to the demands of the user and the particular clinical context. This paper focuses on a cognitive evaluation of one component of this project, a Query User Interface (QUI). The study examines the system's ability to allow users to easily and intuitively express their information needs. We performed several analyses including a cognitive walkthrough of the interface and quantitative estimations of cognitive load. The paper also presents a preliminary analysis of usability testing. The analyses suggest that there are features in the QUI that contribute to a greater cognitive load and result in greater effort on the part of the subject. The results of usability testing are consistent with these findings. However, subjects found it to be relatively easy and intuitive to generate well-formed queries using the interface. This study contributed to the iterative design of the interface and to the next generation of the PERSIVAL system.",

        "Abstract": "This paper reports the effects of a tailored Web-based delivery system on self-efficacy as it relates to a patients' response to acute myocardial information (AMI) symptoms. The data reported are from MI-HEART, a randomized trial examining ways in which a clinical information system can favorably influence the appropriateness and rapidity of decision-making in patients suffering from symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Participants were randomized into one of three groups: tailored Web-based, non-tailored Web-based and non-tailored paper based. A theoretically based behavioral-cognitive model was used to identify key variables upon which to tailor education material. A key variable in the model is self-efficacy, operationalized with a three-dimensional scaling. Results show trends in improved self-efficacy scores for all groups at 1-month follow up, with sustained significant increases in baseline to 3-month scores only in the tailored Web-based group. One possible explanation could be related to \"hit-count\", which was significantly higher in the tailored group. This study is a first step in quantifying the contribution of Web-based tailoring over non-tailoring in changing key determinants of patient delay to AMI symptoms.",

Because our theory does not say, exactly, what those needs are, we are using an empirical approach (observation) to detecting and categorizing them. For each need, we can construct an \"infobutton\" that links the clinical data to an on-line information resource. We have constructed an Infobutton Manager to match the data being reviewed by clinicians with context-appropriate infobuttons. This paper describes how the theory, observations, and practical solutions can come together to improve clinician decision making by resolving information needs.",
