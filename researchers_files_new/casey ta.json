        "Abstract": "Diagnosis for rare genetic diseases often relies on phenotype-driven methods, which hinge on the accuracy and completeness of the rare disease phenotypes in the underlying annotation knowledgebase. Existing knowledgebases are often manually curated with additional annotations found in published case reports. Despite their potential, real-world data such as electronic health records (EHRs) have not been fully exploited to derive rare disease annotations. Here, we present open annotation for rare diseases (OARD), a real-world-data-derived resource with annotation for rare-disease-related phenotypes. This resource is derived from the EHRs of two academic health institutions containing more than 10 million individuals spanning wide age ranges and different disease subgroups. By leveraging ontology mapping and advanced natural-language-processing (NLP) methods, OARD automatically and efficiently extracts concepts for both rare diseases and their phenotypic traits from billing codes and lab tests as well as over 100 million clinical narratives. The rare disease prevalence derived by OARD is highly correlated with those annotated in the original rare disease knowledgebase. By performing association analysis, we identified more than 1 million novel disease-phenotype association pairs that were previously missed by human annotation, and >60% were confirmed true associations via manual review of a list of sampled pairs. Compared to the manual curated annotation, OARD is 100% data driven and its pipeline can be shared across different institutions. By supporting privacy-preserving sharing of aggregated summary statistics, such as term frequencies and disease-phenotype associations, it fills an important gap to facilitate data-driven research in the rare disease community.",

        "Abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened the health of tens of millions of people worldwide and imposed heavy burden on global healthcare systems. In this paper, we propose a model to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-19 will develop severe outcomes based only on the patient's historical electronic health records (EHR) prior to hospital admission using recurrent neural networks. The model predicts risk score that represents the probability for a patient to progress into severe status (mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, or death) after being infected with COVID-19. The model achieved 0.846 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting patients' outcomes averaged over 5-fold cross validation. While many of the existing models use features obtained after diagnosis of COVID-19, our proposed model only utilizes a patient's historical EHR to enable proactive risk management at the time of hospital admission.",

        "Abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened the health of tens of millions of people worldwide and imposed heavy burden on global healthcare systems. In this paper, we propose a model to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-19 will develop severe outcomes based only on the patient's historical electronic health records (EHR) prior to hospital admission using recurrent neural networks. The model predicts risk score that represents the probability for a patient to progress into severe status (mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, or death) after being infected with COVID-19. The model achieved 0.846 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting patients' outcomes averaged over 5-fold cross validation. While many of the existing models use features obtained after diagnosis of COVID-19, our proposed model only utilizes a patient's historical EHR to enable proactive risk management at the time of hospital admission.",

Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate automated phenotype extraction and thus improve the efficiency of curating clinical phenotypes from clinical texts. While individual NLP systems can perform well for a single cohort, an ensemble-based method might shed light on increasing the portability of NLP pipelines across different cohorts.",

In this manuscript, we contribute methodology for data quality assessment by plotting domain-level (conditions (diagnoses), drugs, and procedures) aggregate statistics and concept-level temporal frequencies (i.e., annual prevalence rates of clinical concepts). We detect common temporal patterns in concept frequencies by normalizing and clustering annual concept frequencies using K-means clustering. We apply these methods to the Columbia University Irving Medical Center Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership database. The resulting domain-aggregate and cluster plots show a variety of patterns. We review the patterns found in the condition domain and investigate the processes that shape them. We find that these patterns suggest data quality issues influenced by system-wide factors that affect individual concept frequencies.",

        "Abstract": "Columbia Open Health Data (COHD) is a publicly accessible database of electronic health record (EHR) prevalence and co-occurrence frequencies between conditions, drugs, procedures, and demographics. COHD was derived from Columbia University Irving Medical Center's Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) database. The lifetime dataset, derived from all records, contains 36,578 single concepts (11,952 conditions, 12,334 drugs, and 10,816 procedures) and 32,788,901 concept pairs from 5,364,781 patients. The 5-year dataset, derived from records from 2013-2017, contains 29,964 single concepts (10,159 conditions, 10,264 drugs, and 8,270 procedures) and 15,927,195 concept pairs from 1,790,431 patients. Exclusion of rare concepts (countâ€‰â‰¤â€‰10) and Poisson randomization enable data sharing by eliminating risks to patient privacy. EHR prevalences are informative of healthcare consumption rates. Analysis of co-occurrence frequencies via relative frequency analysis and observed-expected frequency ratio are informative of associations between clinical concepts, useful for biomedical research tasks such as drug repurposing and pharmacovigilance. COHD is publicly accessible through a web application-programming interface (API) and downloadable from the Figshare repository. The code is available on GitHub.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose To assess the performance of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems and to determine the dominant ultrasonographic (US) features when classifying benign versus malignant focal liver lesions (FLLs) by using contrast material-enhanced US cine clips. Materials and Methods One hundred six US data sets in all subjects enrolled by three centers from a multicenter trial that included 54 malignant, 51 benign, and one indeterminate FLL were retrospectively analyzed. The 105 benign or malignant lesions were confirmed at histologic examination, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and/or 6 or more months of clinical follow-up. Data sets included 3-minute cine clips that were automatically corrected for in-plane motion and automatically filtered out frames acquired off plane. B-mode and contrast-specific features were automatically extracted on a pixel-by-pixel basis and analyzed by using an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for CAD were compared with those for one experienced and one inexperienced blinded reader. A third observer graded cine quality to assess its effects on CAD performance. Results CAD, the inexperienced observer, and the experienced observer were able to analyze 95, 100, and 102 cine clips, respectively. The AUCs for the SVM, ANN, and experienced and inexperienced observers were 0.883 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.793, 0.940), 0.829 (95% CI: 0.724, 0.901), 0.843 (95% CI: 0.756, 0.903), and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.586, 0.782), respectively; only the difference between SVM and the inexperienced observer was statistically significant. Accuracy improved from 71.3% (67 of 94; 95% CI: 60.6%, 79.8%) to 87.7% (57 of 65; 95% CI: 78.5%, 93.8%) and from 80.9% (76 of 94; 95% CI: 72.3%, 88.3%) to 90.3% (65 of 72; 95% CI: 80.6%, 95.8%) when CAD was in agreement with the inexperienced reader and when it was in agreement with the experienced reader, respectively. B-mode heterogeneity and contrast material washout were the most discriminating features selected by CAD for all iterations. CAD selected time-based time-intensity curve (TIC) features 99.0% (207 of 209) of the time to classify FLLs, versus 1.0% (two of 209) of the time for intensity-based features. None of the 15 video-quality criteria had a statistically significant effect on CAD accuracy-all P values were greater than the Holm-Sidak Î±-level correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusion CAD systems classified benign and malignant FLLs with an accuracy similar to that of an expert reader. CAD improved the accuracy of both readers. Time-based features of TIC were more discriminating than intensity-based features. ",

        "Abstract": "An on-demand long-lived ultrasound contrast agent that can be activated with single pulse stimulated imaging (SPSI) has been developed using hard shell liquid perfluoropentane filled silica 500-nm nanoparticles for tumor ultrasound imaging. SPSI was tested on LnCAP prostate tumor models in mice; tumor localization was observed after intravenous (IV) injection of the contrast agent. Consistent with enhanced permeability and retention, the silica nanoparticles displayed an extended imaging lifetime of 3.3Â±1 days (meanÂ±standard deviation). With added tumor specific folate functionalization, the useful lifetime was extended to 12 Â± 2 days; in contrast to ligand-based tumor targeting, the effect of the ligands in this application is enhanced nanoparticle retention by the tumor. This paper demonstrates for the first time that IV injected functionalized silica contrast agents can be imaged with an in vivo lifetime ~500 times longer than current microbubble-based contrast agents. Such functionalized long-lived contrast agents may lead to new applications in tumor monitoring and therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Ultrasound imaging is a safe, low-cost, and in situ method for detecting in vivo medical devices. A poly(methyl-2-cyanoacrylate) film containing 2 Î¼m boron-doped, calcined, porous silica microshells was developed as an ultrasound imaging marker for multiple medical devices. A macrophase separation drove the gas-filled porous silica microshells to the top surface of the polymer film by controlled curing of the cyanoacrylate glue and the amount of microshell loading. A thin film of polymer blocked the wall pores of the microshells to seal air in their hollow core, which served as an ultrasound contrast agent. The ultrasound activity disappeared when curing conditions were modified to prevent the macrophase segregation. Phase segregated films were attached to multiple surgical tools and needles and gave strong color Doppler signals in vitro and in vivo with the use of a clinical ultrasound imaging instrument. Postprocessing of the simultaneous color Doppler and B-mode images can be used for autonomous identification of implanted surgical items by correlating the two images. The thin films were also hydrophobic, thereby extending the lifetime of ultrasound signals to hours of imaging in tissues by preventing liquid penetration. This technology can be used as a coating to guide the placement of implantable medical devices or used to image and help remove retained surgical items.",

        "Abstract": "Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) cines of focal liver lesions (FLLs) can be quantitatively analyzed to measure tumor perfusion on a pixel-by-pixel basis for diagnostic indication. However, CEUS cines acquired freehand and during free breathing cause nonuniform in-plane and out-of-plane motion from frame to frame. These motions create fluctuations in the time-intensity curves (TICs), reducing the accuracy of quantitative measurements. Out-of-plane motion cannot be corrected by image registration in 2-dimensional CEUS and degrades the quality of in-plane motion correction (IPMC). A 2-tier IPMC strategy and adaptive out-of-plane motion filter (OPMF) are proposed to provide a stable correction of nonuniform motion to reduce the impact of motion on quantitative analyses.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, there have been increasing developments in the field of contrast-enhanced ultrasound both in the creation of new contrast agents and in imaging modalities. These contrast agents have been employed to study tumor vasculature in order to improve cancer detection and diagnosis. An in vivo study is presented of ultrasound imaging of gas filled hollow silica microshells and nanoshells which have been delivered intraperitoneally to an IGROV-1 tumor bearing mouse. In contrast to microbubbles, this formulation of microshells provided strong ultrasound imaging signals by shell disruption and release of gas. Imaging of the microshells in an animal model was facilitated by novel image processing. Although the particle signal could be identified by eye under live imaging, high background obfuscated the particle signal in still images and near the borders of the tumor with live images. Image processing techniques were developed that employed the transient nature of the particle signal to selectively filter out the background signal. By applying image registration, high-pass, median, threshold, and motion filtering, a short video clip of the particle signal was compressed into a single image, thereby resolving the silica shells within the tumor.

        "Abstract": "Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) enables highly specific time-resolved imaging of vasculature by intravenous injection of âˆ¼2 Î¼m gas filled microbubbles. To develop a quantitative automated diagnosis of breast tumors with CEUS, breast tumors were induced in rats by administration of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. A bolus injection of microbubbles was administered and CEUS videos of each tumor were acquired for at least 3 min. The time-intensity curve of each pixel within a region of interest (ROI) was analyzed to measure kinetic parameters associated with the wash-in, peak enhancement, and wash-out phases of microbubble bolus injections since it was expected that the aberrant vascularity of malignant tumors will result in faster and more diverse perfusion kinetics versus those of benign lesions. Parameters were classified using linear discriminant analysis to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors and improve diagnostic accuracy. Preliminary results with a small dataset (10 tumors, 19 videos) show 100% accuracy with fivefold cross-validation testing using as few as two choice variables for training and validation. Several of the parameters which provided the best differentiation between malignant and benign tumors employed comparative analysis of all the pixels in the ROI including enhancement coverage, fractional enhancement coverage times, and the standard deviation of the envelope curve difference normalized to the mean of the peak frame. Analysis of combinations of five variables demonstrated that pixel-by-pixel analysis produced the most robust information for tumor diagnostics and achieved 5 times greater separation of benign and malignant cases than ROI-based analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Diagnosing tumors at an early stage when they are easily curable and may not require systemic chemotherapy remains a challenge to clinicians. In order to improve early cancer detection, gas filled hollow boron-doped silica particles have been developed, which can be used for ultrasound-guided breast conservation therapy. The particles are synthesized using a polystyrene template and subsequently calcinated to create hollow, rigid nanoporous microspheres. The microshells are filled with perfluoropentane vapor. Studies were performed in phantoms to optimize particle concentration, injection dose, and the ultrasound settings such as pulse frequency and mechanical index. In vitro studies have shown that these particles can be continuously imaged by US up to 48 min and their signal lifetime persisted for 5 days. These particles could potentially be given by intravenous injection and, in conjunction with contrast-enhanced ultrasound, be utilized as a screening tool to detect smaller breast cancers before they are detectible by traditional mammography.",
