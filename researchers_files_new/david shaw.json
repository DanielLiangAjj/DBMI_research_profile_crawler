        "Title": "Toward Transparency on Animal Experimentation in Switzerland: Seven Recommendations for the Provision of Public Information in Swiss Law.",
        "Abstract": "In Switzerland, the importance of transparency in animal experimentation is emphasized by the Swiss Federal Council, recognizing the public's great interest in this matter. Federal reporting on animal experimentation indicates a total of 585,991 animals used in experiments in Switzerland in 2022. By Swiss law, the report enables the public to learn about many aspects such as the species and degree of suffering experienced by the animals, but some information of interest to the public is missing, such as the fate of the animals at the end of the experiment (e.g., euthanized, rehomed in a private home, reused in another experiment). When it comes to animals bred in facilities but not used in experiments, further information of interest is not required to be made public according to Swiss law, for example, the number and fate of \"surplus\" animals (i.e., animals bred but not used in experiments for a variety of reasons such as not carrying the phenotypical properties needed). Considering that the Swiss government has a duty to provide a full accounting of animal experimentation conducted on the public's behalf, further relevant information should be disclosed. While efforts toward transparency, such as the STAAR Agreement, have been made in the scientific community, these mostly reflect the legal requirements already in force. If Switzerland is to move toward more transparency in public information on animal experimentation, an update of the legal requirements is needed. In this article, we give recommendations for Swiss law to move toward more transparency in public information on seven aspects: (1) the fate of the animals at the end of the experiment; (2) the sources of funding for animal experimentation; (3) the harm-benefit analysis performed by researchers and ethics committees to justify an experiment using animals; (4) the number of breeding/surplus animals; (5) the fate of breeding/surplus animals; (6) the harms experienced by animals in facilities; and (7) the funding of animal facilities.",

        "Abstract": "The use of nonhuman animals in biomedical research is regulated under stringent conditions, not only in response to societal attitudes towards animal experimentation but also because ethical responsibility in scientific research requires researchers and veterinarians to be more invested and aim to improve the welfare of animals used for experiments. Analyses of animal research oversight reveal the frequent approval of experiments, and the approval of some experiments has raised and continues to raise public concerns. Societal compliance is required for a consensus-based approach to animal research policy, prompting the need to have transparent discussions about oversight and the frequency of approvals. We discuss how frequent approval may be perceived and why it seems problematic from a societal perspective: the regulatory process exists to approve only legitimate experiments. Although some experiments remain unacceptable irrespective of their harm-benefit ratios, almost all experiments are approved. We explain some possible legitimate reasons for frequent approval and how the review process could be leading to the approval of illegitimate studies. To ensure transparency and improve public trust and understanding of oversight, we propose the adoption of a platform to inform society about how unethical experiments are screened out.",

        "Abstract": "Indoor sources of air pollution, such as from cooking and cleaning, play a key role in indoor gas-phase chemistry. The focus of the impact of these activities on air quality tends to be indoors, with less attention given to the impact on air quality outside buildings. This study uses the INdoor CHEmical Model in Python (INCHEM-Py) and the Advanced Dispersion Modelling System (ADMS) to quantify the impact cooking and cleaning have on indoor and outdoor air quality for an idealised street of houses. INCHEM-Py has been developed to determine the concentrations of 106 indoor volatile organic compounds at the point they leave a building (defined as near-field concentrations). For a simulated 140 m long street with 10 equi-distant houses undertaking cooking and cleaning activities, the maximum downwind concentration of acetaldehyde increases from a background value of 0.1 ppb to 0.9 ppb post-cooking, whilst the maximum downwind chloroform concentrations increase from 1.2 to 6.2 ppt after cleaning. Although emissions to outdoors are higher when cooking and cleaning happen indoors, the contribution of these activities to total UK emissions of volatile organic compounds is low (less than 1%), and comprise about a quarter of those emitted from traffic across the UK. It is important to quantify these emissions, particularly as continued vehicle technology improvements lead to lower direct emissions outdoors, making indoor emissions relatively more important. Understanding how indoor pollution can affect outdoor environments, will allow better mitigation measures to be designed in the future that can take into account all sources of pollution that contribute to human exposure.",

We conclude that previous criticisms of the law do not go far enough: far from protecting animal dignity, the Swiss law not only undermines such dignity but itself serves as a means to ensure that animals can be used merely as a means, and not treated with respect. As such, the Swiss Animal Welfare Act is deeply unethical and undermines the constitutional requirement to treat animals with dignity.",

        "Abstract": "The question of the use of expired medication is a constant debate of many years most especially in a difficult environment. In this research, a literature review and reported practice of some countries are used. Findings show that some medications, if properly stored, remain safe to use after the expiry date and this sometimes could be extended by many years. However, the pharmaceutical manufacturers have an interest in producing products with short shelf life. To dispose of expired ones is to generate a sale and therefore put the profit into the improvement and development of new products for the benefit of medicine. This paper emphasizes the benefit of use of some drugs after expiration and the interest for the pharmaceutical industry to dispose of expired drugs and to shorten their shelf life.",

        "Abstract": "The convergence of human and artificial intelligence is currently receiving considerable scholarly attention. Much debate about the resulting Hybrid Minds focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence into the human brain through intelligent brain-computer interfaces as they enter clinical use. In this contribution we discuss a complementary development: the integration of a functional in vitro network of human neurons into an in silico computing environment.To do so, we draw on a recent experiment reporting the creation of silico-biological intelligence as a case study (Kagan et al., 2022b). In this experiment, multielectrode arrays were plated with stem cell-derived human neurons, creating a system which the authors call DishBrain. By embedding the system into a virtual game-world, neural clusters were able to receive electrical input signals from the game-world and to respond appropriately with output signals from pre-assigned motor regions. Using this design, the authors demonstrate how the DishBrain self-organises and successfully learns to play the computer game 'Pong', exhibiting 'sentient' and intelligent behaviour in its virtual environment.The creation of such hybrid, silico-biological intelligence raises numerous ethical challenges. Following the neuroscientific framework embraced by the authors themselves, we discuss the arising ethical challenges in the context of Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle, focusing on the risk of creating synthetic phenomenology. Following the DishBrain's creator's neuroscientific assumptions, we highlight how DishBrain's design may risk bringing about artificial suffering and argue for a congruently cautious approach to such synthetic biological intelligence.",

        "Abstract": "The cation channel TRPA1 is a potentially important drug target, and characterization of TRPA1 functional dynamics might help guide structure-based drug design. Here, we present results from long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of TRPA1 with an allosteric activator, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), in which we observed spontaneous transitions from a closed, non-conducting channel conformation into an open, conducting conformation. Based on these transitions, we propose a gating mechanism in which movement of a regulatory TRP-like domain allosterically translates into pore opening in a manner reminiscent of pore opening in voltage-gated ion channels. In subsequent experiments, we found that mutations that disrupt packing of the S4-S5 linker-TRP-like domain and the S5 and S6 helices also affected channel activity. In simulations, we also observed A-967079, a known allosteric inhibitor, binding between helices S5 and S6, suggesting that A-967079 may suppress activity by stabilizing a non-conducting pore conformation-a finding consistent with our proposed gating mechanism.",

        "Title": "Recovery from acute hypoxia: A systematic review of cognitive and physiological responses during the 'hypoxia hangover'.",
        "Abstract": "Recovery of cognitive and physiological responses following a hypoxic exposure may not be considered in various operational and research settings. Understanding recovery profiles and influential factors can guide post-hypoxia restrictions to reduce the risk of further cognitive and physiological deterioration, and the potential for incidents and accidents. We systematically evaluated the available evidence on recovery of cognitive and basic physiological responses following an acute hypoxic exposure to improve understanding of the performance and safety implications, and to inform post-hypoxia restrictions. This systematic review summarises 30 studies that document the recovery of either a cognitive or physiological index from an acute hypoxic exposure. Titles and abstracts from PubMed (MEDLINE) and Scopus were searched from inception to July 2022, of which 22 full text articles were considered eligible. An additional 8 articles from other sources were identified and also considered eligible. The overall quality of evidence was moderate (average Rosendal score, 58%) and there was a large range of hypoxic exposures. Heart rate, peripheral blood haemoglobin-oxygen saturation and heart rate variability typically normalised within seconds-to-minutes following return to normoxia or hyperoxia. Whereas, cognitive performance, blood pressure, cerebral tissue oxygenation, ventilation and electroencephalogram indices could persist for minutes-to-hours following a hypoxic exposure, and one study suggested regional cerebral tissue oxygenation requires up to 24 hours to recover. Full recovery of most cognitive and physiological indices, however, appear much sooner and typically within ~2-4 hours. Based on these findings, there is evidence to support a 'hypoxia hangover' and a need to implement restrictions following acute hypoxic exposures. The severity and duration of these restrictions is unclear but should consider the population, subsequent requirement for safety-critical tasks and hypoxic exposure.",

        "Abstract": "Collaborative action on the part of all stakeholders in pest management is essential to effectively address the challenges of pesticide resistance. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), through its Pesticide Program Dialogue Committee, recently posted a report on pesticide resistance management and the role the Agency can play in these efforts. In this Perspective, we commend the Agency for acknowledging these needs, and encourage implementation of the recommendations. We urge all stakeholders to follow the example set by the EPA to engage openly, listen to other stakeholders, and determine their role as part of the broader community that is needed to address the challenges of resistance. Our contention is that pesticide resistance will continue to escalate until all stakeholders evaluate their roles in resistance management and work together as a community to influence effective management. © 2023 The Authors.

        "Abstract": "Since Russell and Burch introduced and defined the 3Rs, i.e., the replacement, reduction, and refinement of animal use in research, in 1959, different definitions have emerged and been implemented in guidelines and policies. Switzerland is known for having some of the most restrictive legislation regarding the use of animals, in which the 3Rs are also defined and implemented. To our knowledge, the purpose and definitions of the 3Rs used in the Swiss Animal Welfare Act, Animal Protection Ordinance, and Animal Experimentation Ordinance have never been compared with Russell and Burch’s original purpose and definitions. In this paper we make this comparison with two aims: to reveal ethically relevant departures from the original purpose and definitions, and to provide an ethical evaluation of the current Swiss law regarding the 3Rs. In doing so, we first expose the similarity of purposes. We then identify one risky departure from the original definition of replacement in Swiss law, which shows a problematic focus on species. Finally, we address Swiss law’s failure to apply the 3Rs in the most effective way. With respect to this last point, we discuss the need for 3R conflict resolution, the timing of application of the 3Rs, problematic prioritizations and choices of convenience as well as a solution to apply the 3Rs more effectively using Russell and Burch’s concept of total sum of distress.",

        "Title": "A Conserved Local Structural Motif Controls the Kinetics of PTP1B Catalysis.",
        "Abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of the insulin and leptin signaling pathways, making it a highly attractive target for the treatment of type II diabetes. For PTP1B to perform its enzymatic function, a loop referred to as the \"WPD loop\" must transition between open (catalytically incompetent) and closed (catalytically competent) conformations, which have both been resolved by X-ray crystallography. Although prior studies have established this transition as the rate-limiting step for catalysis, the transition mechanism for PTP1B and other PTPs has been unclear. Here we present an atomically detailed model of WPD loop transitions in PTP1B based on unbiased, long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and weighted ensemble simulations. We found that a specific WPD loop region─the PDFG motif─acted as the key conformational switch, with structural changes to the motif being necessary and sufficient for transitions between long-lived open and closed states of the loop. Simulations starting from the closed state repeatedly visited open states of the loop that quickly closed again unless the infrequent conformational switching of the motif stabilized the open state. The functional importance of the PDFG motif is supported by the fact that it is well conserved across PTPs. Bioinformatic analysis shows that the PDFG motif is also conserved, and adopts two distinct conformations, in deiminases, and the related DFG motif is known to function as a conformational switch in many kinases, suggesting that PDFG-like motifs may control transitions between structurally distinct, long-lived conformational states in multiple protein families.",

Directed deceased organ donation is currently possible under strict conditions in a limited number of countries, while it is currently not possible to opt for directed donation following euthanasia. While organ donation after euthanasia is a deceased donation procedure, directed organ donation after euthanasia could be seen as a deceased donation procedure with a living donation consent process. Therefore, directed organ donation after euthanasia is feasible on medical and ethical grounds. Strict safeguards should be in place, including the requirement of a pre-existing familial or personal relationship with the proposed recipient, without any evidence of coercion or financial gain.",

        "Abstract": "Health care in prison is a challenging task. The conditions of imprisonment create distinct difficulties for those providing health care in this setting. These particular circumstances have led to a shortage of quality professionals, working for the health of imprisoned people. The aim of this study is to elaborate reasons for healthcare professionals to work in a prison environment. The main research question is: why do healthcare workers choose to work in prisons? Furthermore, our study identifies training needs in various fields. Interview data that comes from a national project carried out in Switzerland and three other relatively wealthy countries were analyzed using content analysis. One-on-one, semi structured interviews were designed and conducted with professionals working in prison context. A total of 105 interviews were carried out and for this work 83 of them were analyzed and coded into themes responding to the study aim. Most participants chose to work in prison either because of practical reasons, as many reported various forms of contact with the studied prison environment at a younger age, or because of intrinsic reasons, including among others, having the wish to change the system of healthcare in prisons. Even though the education of the participants varied greatly, a lack of specialist training was expressed by many health care professions as an important factor. This study points out the need for more specific training programs for healthcare workers in prison and provides suggestions to ameliorate the recruitment and education for future prison health care workers.",

        "Abstract": "This systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression examined the effect of acute normobaric hyperoxic breathing on cognition in healthy humans. 23 studies were included providing 76 effect estimates (EE). Hyperoxic breathing improved memory accuracy (22 EEs; g = 0.34) and speed (9 EEs; g = 0.59), attention accuracy (7 EEs; g = 0.59) and speed (7 EEs; g = 0.51), reaction speed (8 EEs; g = 0.82), crystallised intelligence (7 EEs; g = 0.73), executive function (6 EEs; g = 0.88) and information processing (10 EEs; g = 0.62). However, the overall quality of evidence was low (average Rosendal score of 47%) and there was a large range of study heterogeneity, with prediction intervals often crossing 0; therefore, reducing the reliability of the magnitude of these favourable effects. Oxygen percentage, 100% compared with 22-99% oxygen, temporal position of administration to task performance, and study quality did not influence the overall weighted mean effects for most cognitive domains. Altogether, despite beneficial results, further high quality research is required prior to recommending hyperoxic breathing to enhance cognition.",

        "Abstract": "Fragment-based drug discovery has led to six approved drugs, but the small sizes of the chemical fragments used in such methods typically result in only weak interactions between the fragment and its target molecule, which makes it challenging to experimentally determine the three-dimensional poses fragments assume in the bound state. One computational approach that could help address this difficulty is long-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which have been used in retrospective studies to recover experimentally known binding poses of fragments. Here, we present the results of long-timescale MD simulations that we used to prospectively discover binding poses for two series of fragments in allosteric pockets on a difficult and important pharmaceutical target, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1b (PTP1b). Our simulations reversibly sampled the fragment association and dissociation process. One of the binding pockets found in the simulations has not to our knowledge been previously observed with a bound fragment, and the other pocket adopted a very rare conformation. We subsequently obtained high-resolution crystal structures of members of each fragment series bound to PTP1b, and the experimentally observed poses confirmed the simulation results. To the best of our knowledge, our findings provide the first demonstration that MD simulations can be used prospectively to determine fragment binding poses to previously unidentified pockets.",

        "Abstract": "To perform their physiological functions, amino methyl propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) cycle through active, resting, and desensitized states, and dysfunction in AMPAR activity is associated with various neurological disorders. Transitions among AMPAR functional states, however, are largely uncharacterized at atomic resolution and are difficult to examine experimentally. Here, we report long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of dimerized AMPAR ligand-binding domains (LBDs), whose conformational changes are tightly coupled to changes in AMPAR functional states, in which we observed LBD dimer activation and deactivation upon ligand binding and unbinding at atomic resolution. Importantly, we observed the ligand-bound LBD dimer transition from the active conformation to several other conformations, which may correspond with distinct desensitized conformations. We also identified a linker region whose structural rearrangements heavily affected the transitions to and among these putative desensitized conformations, and confirmed, using electrophysiology experiments, the importance of the linker region in these functional transitions.",

        "Abstract": "Proteins often undergo large conformational changes when binding small molecules, but atomic-level descriptions of such events have been elusive. Here, we report unguided molecular dynamics simulations of Abl kinase binding to the cancer drug imatinib. In the simulations, imatinib first selectively engages Abl kinase in its autoinhibitory conformation. Consistent with inferences drawn from previous experimental studies, imatinib then induces a large conformational change of the protein to reach a bound complex that closely resembles published crystal structures. Moreover, the simulations reveal a surprising local structural instability in the C-terminal lobe of Abl kinase during binding. The unstable region includes a number of residues that, when mutated, confer imatinib resistance by an unknown mechanism. Based on the simulations, NMR spectra, hydrogen-deuterium exchange measurements, and thermostability measurements and estimates, we suggest that these mutations confer imatinib resistance by exacerbating structural instability in the C-terminal lobe, rendering the imatinib-bound state energetically unfavorable.",

        "Title": "The complexity of biological disturbance agents, fuels heterogeneity, and fire in coniferous forests of the western United States.",
        "Abstract": "Forest biological disturbance agents (BDAs) are insects, pathogens, and parasitic plants that affect tree decline, mortality, and forest ecosystems processes. BDAs are commonly thought to increase the likelihood and severity of fire by converting live standing trees to more flammable, dead and downed fuel. However, recent research indicates that BDAs do not necessarily increase, and can reduce, the likelihood or severity of fire. This has led to confusion regarding the role of BDAs in influencing fuels and fire in fire-prone western United States forests. Here, we review the existing literature on BDAs and their effects on fuels and fire in the western US and develop a conceptual framework to better understand the complex relationships between BDAs, fuels and fire. We ask: 1) What are the major BDA groups in western US forests that affect fuels? and 2) How do BDA-affected fuels influence fire risk and outcomes? The conceptual framework is rooted in the spatiotemporal aspects of BDA life histories, which drive forest impacts, fuel characteristics and if ignited, fire outcomes. Life histories vary among BDAs from episodic, landscape-scale outbreaks (bark beetles, defoliators), to chronic, localized disturbance effects (dwarf mistletoes, root rots). Generally, BDAs convert aboveground live biomass to dead biomass, decreasing canopy fuels and increasing surface fuels. However, the rate of conversion varies with time-since-event and among BDAs and forest types, resulting in a wide range of effects on the amount of dead fuels at any given time and place, which interacts with the structure and composition of the stand before and subsequent to BDA events. A major influence on fuels may be that BDAs have emerged as dominant agents of forest heterogeneity creation. Because BDAs play complex roles in fuels and fire heterogeneity across the western US which are further complicated by interactions with climate change, drought, and forest management (fire suppression), their impacts on fuels, fire and ecological consequences cannot be categorized simply as positive or negative but need to be evaluated within the context of BDA life histories and ecosystem dynamics.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are becoming ever more widespread in healthcare and could play an important role in diagnostic and treatment processes. For this reason, AI-based CDSS has an impact on the doctor-patient relationship, shaping their decisions with its suggestions. We may be on the verge of a paradigm shift, where the doctor-patient relationship is no longer a dual relationship, but a triad. This paper analyses the role of AI-based CDSS for shared decision-making to better comprehend its promises and associated ethical issues. Moreover, it investigates how certain AI implementations may instead foster the inappropriate paradigm of paternalism. Understanding how AI relates to doctors and influences doctor-patient communication is essential to promote more ethical medical practice. Both doctors' and patients' autonomy need to be considered in the light of AI.",

Advancements in aerospace engineering, flight profiles, and mission demands may require the pilot to test the safe limits of their physiology. Monitoring pilot physiology (e.g. heart rate, oximetry, and respiration) inflight is in consideration by several nations to inform pilots of reduced performance capacity and guide future developments in aircraft and life-support system design. Numerous challenges, however, prevent the immediate operationalisation of physiological monitoring sensors, particularly their unreliability in the aerospace environment and incompatibility with pilot clothing and protective equipment. Human performance and behaviour are also highly variable and measuring these in controlled laboratory settings do not mirror the real-world conditions pilots must endure. Misleading or erroneous predictive models are unacceptable as these could compromise mission success and lose operator trust. This narrative review provides an overview of considerations for integrating physiological monitoring systems within the military aviation environment.",

        "Abstract": "Extended wakefulness, or sleep deprivation, impairs cognitive performance and brain glucose metabolism. A ketogenic diet (KD) provides an alternative fuel source, ketone bodies, that could elicit a metabolic benefit during sleep deprivation. A randomised, cross-over trial was conducted with seven male military personnel. Participants ingested an iso-energetic ketogenic diet or carbohydrate-based diet for 14 days, immediately followed by 36 h of extended wakefulness and separated by a 12 day washout. Cognitive performance, mood, subjective sleepiness, capillary blood glucose, and D-β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were measured every 2 h during extended wakefulness. Linear mixed models were used to analyse data. D-β-hydroxybutyrate was higher (p < 0.001) and glucose was lower (p < 0.01) on the KD compared with the carbohydrate-based diet. The KD improved psychomotor vigilance task performance (number of lapses, mean reciprocal response time, mean fastest 10% response time (RT), and mean slowest 10% RT; all p < 0.05), running memory continuous performance test performance (RT and number of correct responses per minute; both p < 0.01), and vigour, fatigue, and sleepiness (all, p ≤ 0.001) compared with the carbohydrate-based diet. In conclusion, a KD demonstrated beneficial effects on cognitive performance, mood, and sleepiness during 36 h of extended wakefulness compared with a carbohydrate-based diet.",

        "Title": "Gating and modulation of an inward-rectifier potassium channel.",
        "Abstract": "Inward-rectifier potassium channels (Kirs) are lipid-gated ion channels that differ from other K+ channels in that they allow K+ ions to flow more easily into, rather than out of, the cell. Inward rectification is known to result from endogenous magnesium ions or polyamines (e.g., spermine) binding to Kirs, resulting in a block of outward potassium currents, but questions remain regarding the structural and dynamic basis of the rectification process and lipid-dependent channel activation. Here, we present the results of long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations starting from a crystal structure of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-bound chicken Kir2.2 with a non-conducting pore. After introducing a mutation (G178R) that is known to increase the open probability of a homologous channel, we were able to observe transitions to a stably open, ion-conducting pore, during which key conformational changes occurred in the main activation gate and the cytoplasmic domain. PIP2 binding appeared to increase stability of the pore in its open and conducting state, as PIP2 removal resulted in pore closure, with a median closure time about half of that with PIP2 present. To investigate structural details of inward rectification, we simulated spermine binding to and unbinding from the open pore conformation at positive and negative voltages, respectively, and identified a spermine-binding site located near a previously hypothesized site between the pore cavity and the selectivity filter. We also studied the effects of long-range electrostatics on conduction and spermine binding by mutating charged residues in the cytoplasmic domain and found that a finely tuned charge density, arising from basic and acidic residues within the cytoplasmic domain, modulated conduction and rectification.",

        "Abstract": "Healthcare cybersecurity is increasingly targeted by malicious hackers. This sector has many vulnerabilities and health data is very sensitive and valuable. Consequently, any damage caused by malicious intrusions is particularly alarming. The consequences of these attacks can be enormous and endanger patient care. Amongst the already-implemented cybersecurity measures and the ones that need to be further improved, this paper aims to demonstrate how penetration tests can greatly benefit healthcare cybersecurity. It is already proven that this approach has enforced cybersecurity in other sectors. However, it is not popular in healthcare since many prejudices still surround the hacking practice and there is a lack of education on hackers' categories and their ethics. The present analysis aims to comprehend what hacker ethics is and who ethical hackers are. Currently, hacker ethics has the status of personal ethics; however, to employ penetration testers in healthcare, it is recommended to draft an official code of ethics, comprising principles, standards, expectations, and best practices. Additionally, it is important to distinguish between malicious hackers and ethical hackers. Amongst the latter, penetration testers are only a sub-category. Acknowledging the subtle differences between ethical hackers and penetration testers allows to better understand why and how the latter can offer their services to healthcare facilities.",

        "Abstract": "This article provides a systematic analysis of the proposal to use Covid-19 vaccination status as a criterion for admission of patients with Covid-19 to intensive care units (ICUs) under conditions of resource scarcity. The general consensus is that it is inappropriate to use vaccination status as a criterion because doing so would be unjust; many health systems, including the UK National Health Service, are based on the principle of equality of access to care. However, the analysis reveals that there are several unique features of Covid vaccination status in the context of a pandemic that make this issue disanalogous to cases (such as lung cancer caused by smoking) discussed previously. First, there is equality in access to care at the point of vaccination; the unvaccinated refuse the offer of preventive care when they decline vaccination, weakening their claim to ongoing care if they become ill (this is qualitatively different from 'poor lifestyle choices' such as smoking). Second, the decision of one person to refuse vaccination substantially increases the risk that they will become seriously ill and need ICU care; the person who chooses not to get vaccinated thus potentially increases the pressure on intensive care bed provision, as well as increasing the risk that he or she will infect others who in turn might end up needing ICU care. Third, justice cuts both ways, and giving unvaccinated patients equal priority may itself be unjust when other patients have reduced their risk of ending up on the ICU by getting vaccinated.",

        "Abstract": "A key step in the emergence of human pandemic influenza strains has been a switch in binding preference of the viral glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) from avian to human sialic acid (SA) receptors. The conformation of the bound SA varies substantially with HA sequence, and crystallographic evidence suggests that the bound SA is flexible, making it difficult to predict which mutations are responsible for changing HA-binding preference. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SA analogues binding to various HAs and observed a dynamic equilibrium among structurally diverse receptor conformations, including conformations that have not been experimentally observed. Using one such novel conformation, we predicted─and experimentally confirmed─a set of mutations that substantially increased an HA's affinity for a human SA analogue. This prediction could not have been inferred from the existing crystal structures, suggesting that MD-generated HA-SA conformational ensembles could help researchers predict human-adaptive mutations, aiding surveillance of emerging pandemic threats.",

        "Abstract": "The importance of photolysis as an initiator of air chemistry outdoors is widely recognized, but its role in chemical processing indoors is often ignored. This paper uses recent experimental data to modify a detailed chemical model, using it to investigate the impacts of glass type, artificial indoor lighting, cloudiness, time of year and latitude on indoor photolysis rates and hence indoor air chemistry. Switching from an LED to an uncovered fluorescent tube light increased predicted indoor hydroxyl radical concentrations by ~13%. However, moving from glass that transmitted outdoor light at wavelengths above 380 nm to one that transmitted sunlight above 315 nm led to an increase in predicted hydroxyl radicals of more than 400%. For our studied species, including ozone, nitrogen oxides, nitrous acid, formaldehyde, and hydroxyl radicals, the latter were most sensitive to changes in indoor photolysis rates. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde were largely invariant, with exchange with outdoors and internal deposition controlling their indoor concentrations. Modern lights such as LEDs, together with low transmission glasses, will likely reduce the effects of photolysis indoors and the production of potentially harmful species. Research is needed on the health effects of different indoor air mixtures to confirm this conclusion.",

        "Abstract": "Although molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used extensively to study the structural dynamics of proteins, the role of MD simulation in studies of nucleic acid based systems has been more limited. One contributing factor to this disparity is the historically lower level of accuracy of the physical models used in such simulations to describe interactions involving nucleic acids. By modifying nonbonded and torsion parameters of a force field from the Amber family of models, we recently developed force field parameters for RNA that achieve a level of accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art protein force fields. Here we report force field parameters for DNA, which we developed by transferring nonbonded parameters from our recently reported RNA force field and making subsequent adjustments to torsion parameters. We have also modified the backbone charges in both the RNA and DNA parameter sets to make the treatment of electrostatics compatible with our recently developed variant of the Amber protein and ion force field. We name the force field resulting from the union of these three parameter sets (the new DNA parameters, the revised RNA parameters, and the existing protein and ion parameters) ",

The fracture was abutting intramedullary hyaline lesions. Due to her condition, balanced traction was impossible to apply. The authors report effective treatment of her injury using a non-operative approach in an early hip spica, over a 4-week period. There was no evidence of delayed osseous healing. Early spica application could be used as a definitive management option in children with femur fractures and fixed flexion contractures in future. This case emphasises the need for preventative measures to support bone health in patients with HHFS.",

These species can react in air to form new chemical species, some of which are harmful to health. This paper uses a detailed chemical model for indoor air chemistry, to understand the chemical reactions that can occur following cleaning, assuming cleaning products with different proportions of limonene, α-pinene, and β-pinene are used. The tests included the pure compounds, 50:50 mixtures and mixtures in proportion to the rates of reaction with ozone and the hydroxyl radical. For the 3 h following cleaning, pure α-pinene was most efficient at producing particles, pure limonene for nitrated organic material, and a 50:50 mixture of β-pinene and limonene for formaldehyde, leading to enhancements of 1.1 μg/m",

        "Abstract": "Elevational and latitudinal gradients in species diversity may be mediated by biotic interactions that cause density-dependent effects of conspecifics on survival or growth to differ from effects of heterospecifics (i.e. conspecific density dependence), but limited evidence exists to support this. We tested the hypothesis that conspecific density dependence varies with elevation using over 40 years of data on tree survival and growth from 23 old-growth temperate forest stands across a 1,000-m elevation gradient. We found that conspecific-density-dependent effects on survival of small-to-intermediate-sized focal trees were negative in lower elevation, higher diversity forest stands typically characterised by warmer temperatures and greater relative humidity. Conspecific-density-dependent effects on survival were less negative in higher elevation stands and ridges than in lower elevation stands and valley bottoms for small-to-intermediate-sized trees, but were neutral for larger trees across elevations. Conspecific-density-dependent effects on growth were negative across all tree size classes and elevations. These findings reveal fundamental differences in biotic interactions that may contribute to relationships between species diversity, elevation and climate.",

        "Title": "How does a small molecule bind at a cryptic binding site?",
        "Abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are ubiquitous biomolecular processes that are central to virtually all aspects of cellular function. Identifying small molecules that modulate specific disease-related PPIs is a strategy with enormous promise for drug discovery. The design of drugs to disrupt PPIs is challenging, however, because many potential drug-binding sites at PPI interfaces are \"cryptic\": When unoccupied by a ligand, cryptic sites are often flat and featureless, and thus not readily recognizable in crystal structures, with the geometric and chemical characteristics of typical small-molecule binding sites only emerging upon ligand binding. The rational design of small molecules to inhibit specific PPIs would benefit from a better understanding of how such molecules bind at PPI interfaces. To this end, we have conducted unbiased, all-atom MD simulations of the binding of four small-molecule inhibitors (SP4206 and three SP4206 analogs) to interleukin 2 (IL2)-which performs its function by forming a PPI with its receptor-without incorporating any prior structural information about the ligands' binding. In multiple binding events, a small molecule settled into a stable binding pose at the PPI interface of IL2, resulting in a protein-small-molecule binding site and pose virtually identical to that observed in an existing crystal structure of the IL2-SP4206 complex. Binding of the small molecule stabilized the IL2 binding groove, which when the small molecule was not bound emerged only transiently and incompletely. Moreover, free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations successfully distinguished between the native and non-native IL2-small-molecule binding poses found in the simulations, suggesting that binding simulations in combination with FEP may provide an effective tool for identifying cryptic binding sites and determining the binding poses of small molecules designed to disrupt PPI interfaces by binding to such sites.",

        "Abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are implicated in many human diseases. They have generally not been amenable to conventional structure-based drug design, however, because their intrinsic conformational variability has precluded an atomic-level understanding of their binding to small molecules. Here we present long-time-scale, atomic-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of monomeric α-synuclein (an IDP whose aggregation is associated with Parkinson's disease) binding the small-molecule drug fasudil in which the observed protein-ligand interactions were found to be in good agreement with previously reported NMR chemical shift data. In our simulations, fasudil, when bound, favored certain charge-charge and π-stacking interactions near the C terminus of α-synuclein but tended not to form these interactions simultaneously, rather breaking one of these interactions and forming another nearby (a mechanism we term ",

In this paper, we propose an expansion and explanation of the operational matrix to suggest a stepwise ethical approach to clinician responsibility. We propose and outline the main ethical risks created at each level and discuss how those risks can be mitigated through a balanced application of the predominant ethical principle which in turn provides practical guidance to clinician responsibility. We thus seek to specify the ethical and legal principles that should be used in applying the operational matrix, and what the practical effects could be.",

        "Abstract": "In this article we summarise some previously described proposals for ethical governance of autonomous vehicles ('smart cars'), critique them, and offer an alternative solution. Rather than programming cars to react to crash situations in the same way as humans, having humans program pre-set responses for a wide range of different potential scenarios, or applying particular ethical theories, we suggest that decisions should be made jointly between humans and cars. Given that humans lack the requisite processing capacity, and computers lack the necessary ethical capacity, the medical paradigm of advance care planning can be retooled for this new context. Advance car-crash planning provides a way to combine humans' ethical preferences with the advanced data processing capacities of computers to enable shared decision making in collision situations.",

Key to this discussion is the fact that, contrary to the traditional definition of noise, sound can be noise without being annoying, as the evidence shows that some sounds can harm without being perceived. Ultimately, I develop a theory of 'noisy autonomy' with which to guide us in discussing the public health ethics of noise and other sounds.",

Helmets have shown to be effective in reducing injury severity in bicycle crashes, however, their effects on bicyclists' behaviors still requires deeper understanding, especially amid the emerging trend of using shared bicycles. Risk compensation effects suggest that bicyclists may offset perceived gains in safety from wearing a helmet by increasing risk-taking behaviors. A better understanding of these compensation effects can be useful in assessing various bicycle safety related programs.",

Samples of surficial sediment were collected annually from 1989 through 2019 at water depths of roughly 30 to 240 m by haps corer of Van Veen grab. PAH concentrations were determined by flame-ionization gas chromatography from 1989 to 2002 and by single ion monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometry from 2003 to 2019. Geographic coordinates and environmental variables (water depth, total organic carbon, and sediment grain-size) were also determined. The data are useful for comparisons to trend data elsewhere as well as the investigation of measurement uncertainty in chemical measurements.",

Yet it is still seen as rude to challenge people who do not respect those rules, when in fact the opposite is true; it is rude to increase risk to others. In this paper I analyse the relationship between risk, responsibility, and rudeness by analysing the evolution of the main governmental slogans and rules and explore the complex relationship between simplicity, safety, and perceived fairness of these rules, and how these features in turn influence the extent to which we act responsibly. I begin by exploring the relationship between rudeness and risk in our interactions about coronavirus, before going on to analyse the importance of clear rules in minimizing tension between us, illustrating the argument with various slogans including \"stay at home,\" \"stay alert,\" and the now infamous \"rule of six,\" which is actually at least three different rules. Ultimately, we are faced with a paradox: people annoyed about complex/unfair rules are less likely to obey them, even if that means rules will apply for longer and even though it was noncompliance with earlier simpler rules that means new rules are necessary. And if rules make less or no sense it is harder to try to get people to follow them in your own capacity as a citizen; it is hard to police rules that are seen as arbitrary or unfair.",

        "Abstract": "The protein K-Ras functions as a molecular switch in signaling pathways regulating cell growth. In the human mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is implicated in many cancers, multiple K-Ras proteins are thought to assemble at the cell membrane with Ras effector proteins from the Raf family. Here we propose an atomistic structural model for such an assembly. Our starting point was an asymmetric guanosine triphosphate-mediated K-Ras dimer model, which we generated using unbiased molecular dynamics simulations and verified with mutagenesis experiments. Adding further K-Ras monomers in a head-to-tail fashion led to a compact helical assembly, a model we validated using electron microscopy and cell-based experiments. This assembly stabilizes K-Ras in its active state and presents composite interfaces to facilitate Raf binding. Guided by existing experimental data, we then positioned C-Raf, the downstream kinase MEK1 and accessory proteins (Galectin-3 and 14-3-3σ) on and around the helical assembly. The resulting Ras-Raf signalosome model offers an explanation for a large body of data on MAPK signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Sampling was conducted in Port Valdez, the site of the Valdez marine oil terminal where crude oil is loaded onto tankers for ocean shipment, to characterize sediment polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) concentrations arising from discharge of treated ballast-water from 1989 to 2019. Sediment PAH concentrations have declined since 1991 due to technological improvements in ballast water treatment processes and reductions in the volume of water treated. Spatial variations are associated with water depth reflecting geological and oceanographic characteristics. Comparisons between uncorrected hydrocarbon (compatible with data from 1989 to 2002) and surrogate-corrected concentrations for 2003-2019 suggest minor influence by corrections on inferences. It appears that if reliable measurements are made, the number of analytes and surrogate corrections have minimal influence for characterizing the directions and strengths of spatial and temporal change like that observed in Port Valdez. At present, PAH concentrations in the study area represent low risk for ecological effects.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the largely neglected topic of semantics in medicine and the associated ethical issues. We analyse several key medical terms from the informed perspective of the healthcare professional, the lay perspective of the patient and the patient's family, and the descriptive perspective of what the term actually signifies objectively. The choice of a particular medical term may deliver different meanings when viewed from these differing perspectives. Consequently, several ethical issues may arise. Technical terms that are not commonly understood by lay people may be used by physicians, consciously or not, and may obscure the understanding of the situation by lay people. The choice of particular medical terms may be accidental use of jargon, an attempt to ease the communication of psychologically difficult information, or an attempt to justify a preferred course of action and/or to manipulate the decision-making process.",

Here we demonstrate that this fundamental assumption needs to be revisited through advanced model simulations and extensive measurements of bleach cleaning. We show that inorganic chlorinated products, such as hypochlorous acid and chloramines generated via multiphase reactions, exhibit spatial and vertical concentration gradients in a room, with short-lived ⋅OH radicals confined to sunlit zones, close to windows. Spatial and temporal scales of indoor constituents are modulated by rates of chemical reactions, surface interactions and building ventilation, providing critical insights for better assessments of human exposure to hazardous pollutants, as well as the transport of indoor chemicals outdoors.",

There is no one-size-fits-all recommendation for 'the best work-life balance', as we all have different work-life priorities. But for scientists, at least, Nobel Laureates' thoughts on the matter may prove useful. As such, we describe and discuss, ten recommendations toward a good work-life balance voiced by ten 1996-2013 nobel laureates. \"[Peter Medawar] told his young bride, pretentiously, that she had first claim on his love, but not on his time, made her buy her own wedding ring and often also her own Christmas presents.

        "Abstract": "Understanding the abiotic and biotic variables affecting tick populations is essential for studying the biology and health risks associated with vector species. We conducted a study on the phenology of exotic Haemaphysalis longicornis (Asian longhorned tick) at a site in Albemarle County, Virginia, United States. We also assessed the importance of wildlife hosts, habitats, and microclimate variables such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed on this exotic tick's presence and abundance. In addition, we determined the prevalence of infection with selected tick-borne pathogens in host-seeking H. longicornis. We determined that the seasonal activity of H. longicornis in Virginia was slightly different from previous studies in the northeastern United States. We observed nymphal ticks persist year-round but were most active in the spring, followed by a peak in adult activity in the summer and larval activity in the fall. We also observed a lower probability of collecting host-seeking H. longicornis in field habitats and the summer months. In addition, we detected H. longicornis on several wildlife hosts, including coyote (Canis latrans), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), woodchuck (Marmota monax), and a Peromyscus sp. mouse. This latter record is the first detection of a larval H. longicornis on a North American rodent host important to the enzootic maintenance of tick-borne pathogens of humans and animals. Finally, we continued to detect the exotic piroplasm parasite, Theileria orientalis Ikeda, in H. longicornis as well as other pathogens, including Rickettsia felis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (AP-1), and a Hepatozoon sp. previously characterized in Amblyomma americanum. These represent some of the first detections of arthropod-borne pathogens native to the United States in host-seeking H. longicornis. These data increase our understanding of H. longicornis biology in the United States and provide valuable information into the future health risks associated with this tick and pathogens.",

        "Abstract": "One of the many problems posed by the collective effort to tackle COVID-19 is non-compliance with restrictions. Some people would like to obey restrictions but cannot due to their job or other life circumstances; others are not good at following rules that restrict their liberty, even if the potential consequences of doing so are repeatedly made very clear to them. Among this group are a minority who simply do not care about the consequences of their actions. But many others fail to accurately perceive the harms that they might be causing. One of the main reasons for this is that the harms done by transmitting COVID-19 to someone else are morally distant from the agent, particularly in cases where infection is asymptomatic. In this paper, I describe seven different aspects of moral distance in the context of COVID-19, explore how they affect (lack of) motivation to obey restrictions, and suggest several ways in which such moral distance can be reduced - primarily through enhanced-contact tracing that makes it clear to individuals and the public precisely who they could be harming and how.",

        "Title": "Hypoxic Hypoxia and Brain Function in Military Aviation: Basic Physiology and Applied Perspectives.",
        "Abstract": "Acute hypobaric hypoxia (HH) is a major physiological threat during high-altitude flight and operations. In military aviation, although hypoxia-related fatalities are rare, incidences are common and are likely underreported. Hypoxia is a reduction in oxygen availability, which can impair brain function and performance of operational and safety-critical tasks. HH occurs at high altitude, due to the reduction in atmospheric oxygen pressure. This physiological state is also partially simulated in normobaric environments for training and research, by reducing the fraction of inspired oxygen to achieve comparable tissue oxygen saturation [normobaric hypoxia (NH)]. Hypoxia can occur in susceptible individuals below 10,000 ft (3,048 m) in unpressurised aircrafts and at higher altitudes in pressurised environments when life support systems malfunction or due to improper equipment use. Between 10,000 ft and 15,000 ft (4,572 m), brain function is mildly impaired and hypoxic symptoms are common, although both are often difficult to accurately quantify, which may partly be due to the effects of hypocapnia. Above 15,000 ft, brain function exponentially deteriorates with increasing altitude until loss of consciousness. The period of effective and safe performance of operational tasks following exposure to hypoxia is termed the time-of-useful-consciousness (TUC). Recovery of brain function following hypoxia may also lag beyond arterial reoxygenation and could be exacerbated by repeated hypoxic exposures or hyperoxic recovery. This review provides an overview of the basic physiology and implications of hypoxia for military aviation and discusses the utility of hypoxia recognition training.",

        "Title": "An Ecological Perspective on Living with Fire in Ponderosa Pine Forests of Oregon and Washington: Resistance, Gone but not Forgotten.",
        "Abstract": "Wildland fires (WLF) have become more frequent, larger, and severe with greater impacts to society and ecosystems and dramatic increases in firefighting costs. Forests throughout the range of ponderosa pine in Oregon and Washington are jeopardized by the interaction of anomalously dense forest structure, a warming and drying climate, and an expanding human population. These forests evolved with frequent interacting disturbances including low-severity surface fires, droughts, and biological disturbance agents (BDAs). Chronic low-severity disturbances were, and still are, critical to maintaining disturbance resistance, the property of an ecosystem to withstand disturbance while maintaining its structure and ecological function. Restoration of that historical resistance offers multiple social and ecological benefits. Moving forward, we need a shared understanding of the ecology of ponderosa pine forests to appreciate how restoring resistance can reduce the impacts of disturbances. Given contemporary forest conditions, a warming climate, and growing human populations, we predict continued elevation of tree mortality from drought, BDAs, and the large high-severity WLFs that threaten lives and property as well as ecosystem functions and services. We recommend more comprehensive planning to promote greater use of prescribed fire and management of reported fires for ecological benefits, plus increased responsibility and preparedness of local agencies, communities and individual homeowners for WLF and smoke events. Ultimately, by more effectively preparing for fire in the wildland urban interface, and by increasing the resistance of ponderosa pine forests, we can greatly enhance our ability to live with fire and other disturbances.",

Previous research found that participants in such programs have improved recovery outcomes. While there are demonstrated positive associations between recovery outcomes and peer-provided services, there is limited research on the effectiveness of specific peer-provided interventions. Veteran X is a peer-led program developed in the Department of Veterans Affairs in which participants serve as a recovery team for a fictitious Veteran who faces numerous social and mental health issues. This study compared the effectiveness of the Veteran X program with treatment as usual on measures of recovery wellbeing, symptoms and functioning, and risk and protective factors for substance use disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Much of the ethical discourse concerning the coronavirus pandemic has focused on the allocation of scarce resources, be it potentially beneficial new treatments, ventilators, intensive care beds, or oxygen. Somewhat ironically, the more important ethical issues may lie elsewhere, just as the more important medical issues do not concern intensive care or treatment for COVID-19 patients, but rather the diversion towards these modes of care at the expense of non-Covid patients and treatment. In this article I explore how ethicists can and should prioritize which ethical issues to deal with, and develop a method of triage for identification and prioritization of ethical issues both in the next public health emergency and in bioethics more widely.",

        "Title": "Quantum chemical benchmark databases of gold-standard dimer interaction energies.",
        "Abstract": "Advances in computational chemistry create an ongoing need for larger and higher-quality datasets that characterize noncovalent molecular interactions. We present three benchmark collections of quantum mechanical data, covering approximately 3,700 distinct types of interacting molecule pairs. The first collection, which we refer to as DES370K, contains interaction energies for more than 370,000 dimer geometries. These were computed using the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)], which is widely regarded as the gold-standard method in electronic structure theory. Our second benchmark collection, a core representative subset of DES370K called DES15K, is intended for more computationally demanding applications of the data. Finally, DES5M, our third collection, comprises interaction energies for nearly 5,000,000 dimer geometries; these were calculated using SNS-MP2, a machine learning approach that provides results with accuracy comparable to that of our coupled-cluster training data. These datasets may prove useful in the development of density functionals, empirically corrected wavefunction-based approaches, semi-empirical methods, force fields, and models trained using machine learning methods.",

        "Title": "Midtown splines: An optimal charge assignment for electrostatics calculations.",
        "Abstract": "Transferring particle charges to and from a grid plays a central role in the particle-mesh algorithms widely used to evaluate the electrostatic energy in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The computational cost of this transfer process represents a substantial part of the overall time required for simulation and is primarily determined by the size of the support (the set of grid nodes at which the transfer function is evaluated). The accuracy of the resulting approximation depends on the form of the transfer function, of which several have been proposed, as well as the size and shape of its support. Here, we show how to derive the transfer function that yields maximal asymptotic accuracy for a given support in the limit of fine grid resolution, finding that all such functions are splines, and we determine these functions (which we refer to as midtown splines) for a variety of choices of support to find optimally efficient transfer functions at accuracy levels relevant to MD simulations. We describe midtown splines that achieve fourth- and sixth-order accuracy in the grid spacing while requiring a support size of 32 and 88 grid nodes, respectively, compared to the 64 and 216 nodes required by the most widely used transfer functions (B-splines). At accuracy levels typically used in MD simulations, the use of midtown splines thus cuts the time required for charge spreading by roughly a factor of two.",

        "Abstract": "Beauchamp and Childress' definition of autonomous decision-making includes the conditions of intentionality, understanding, and non-control. In genetics, however, a relational conception of autonomy has been increasingly recognized. This article aims to empirically assess aspects of social influence in genetic testing decision-making and to connect these with principlist and relational theories of autonomy. We interviewed 18 adult genetic counsellees without capacity issues considering predictive genetic testing for cancer predisposition for themselves and two counselling physicians in Switzerland. We conducted a qualitative analysis, building on a grounded theory study about predictive genetic testing decision-making. We found that some participants agreed to predictive genetic testing predominantly because relatives wanted them to do it, with some even acting contrary to their own convictions. Others, in contrast, based their decision on purely individualistic reasons but expressed difficulties in explaining their decision to their social environment. Healthcare professionals had a critical influence on decision-making in many cases without being manipulative, as perceived by counsellees. Still, cases of coercion and social pressure occurred within social relationships. In conclusion, predictive genetic testing decision-making includes relational and individualistic aspects, and both are compatible with autonomous decision-making. While the principlist and relational notions of autonomy compete on a theoretical level, they are two sides of the same coin when used as analytical lenses for genetic testing decision-making. Social acceptance of refusal of testing should be improved to mitigate social pressure. Individuals should be encouraged to decide for themselves how much their social environment influences their decision regarding predictive genetic testing.",

        "Abstract": "We all now know that the novel coronavirus is anything but a common cold. The pandemic has created many new obligations for all of us, several of which come with serious costs to our quality of life. But in some cases, the guidance and the law are open to a degree of interpretation, leaving us to decide what is the ethical (or unethical but desired) course of action. Because of the high cost of some of the obligations, a conflict of interest can arise between what we want to do and what it is right to do. And so, some people choose to respect only the letter of the law, but not the spirit, or not to respect even the spirit of the guidelines. This paper identifies and describes the new obligations imposed on us all by the pandemic, considers their costs in terms of the good life, and provides an ethical analysis of two personal and two public cases in terms of the letter and spirit of the guidance and legislation.",

        "Abstract": "We examine the use of surrogates in the measurement of concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in marine sediment, consider shortcomings of current interpretations of the results from this widely used approach, and propose an alternative data treatment. We focus on the current common practice of accepting all data within a predefined range of acceptable recoveries as equally valid and propose treating surrogate recovery data as one component of measurement uncertainty. Our analysis leads us to conclude that the more uniform surrogate recoveries are, the more justified the assumption that they reveal measurement bias and appropriately can be used as corrections; but that the less uniform recoveries are, the greater the need to treat them as a source of measurement uncertainty. We recognize that acceptance of the ideas presented here will require much thought and refinement by the environmental analytical community. We welcome a thorough discussion.",

In East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, the native and previously introduced ranges, this tick is a vector of an important pathogen of cattle, Theileria orientalis. In 2017, the pathogenic Ikeda genotype of T. orientalis was associated with cattle mortalities in Virginia and in 2018 the exotic H. longicornis was detected at this same site. To investigate the possible role of this exotic tick in the epidemiology of theileriosis in Virginia, we tested host-seeking H. longicornis for piroplasm infections. We document the detection of exotic Theileria orientalis Ikeda genotype in 12.7 % (15/118) environmentally collected H. longicornis using both the 18S rRNA and major piroplasm surface protein (MPSP) gene targets. This is the first detection of a pathogen in H. longicornis in its introduced range in the United States and offers new insight into the animal health risks associated with the introduction of this exotic tick species to North America.",

The use of deep-learning technologies could augment the typical practice of using human intuition in the design cycle, and thereby expedite drug discovery projects. Here, we present DESMILES, a deep neural network model that advances the state of the art in machine learning approaches to molecular design. We applied DESMILES to a previously published benchmark that assesses the ability of a method to modify input molecules to inhibit the dopamine receptor D2, and DESMILES yielded a 77% lower failure rate compared to state-of-the-art models. To explain the ability of DESMILES to hone molecular properties, we visualize a layer of the DESMILES network, and further demonstrate this ability by using DESMILES to tailor the same molecules used in the D2 benchmark test to dock more potently against seven different receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Pharmacophore models are widely used in computational drug discovery (e.g., in the virtual screening of drug molecules) to capture essential information about interactions between ligands and a target protein. Generating pharmacophore models from protein structures is typically a manual process, but there has been growing interest in automated pharmacophore generation methods. Automation makes feasible the processing of large numbers of protein conformations, such as those generated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and thus may help achieve the longstanding goal of incorporating protein flexibility into virtual screening workflows. Here, we present AutoPH4, a new automated method for generating pharmacophore models based on protein structures; we show that a virtual screening workflow incorporating AutoPH4 ranks compounds more accurately than any other pharmacophore-based virtual screening workflow for which results on a public benchmark have been reported. The strong performance of the virtual screening workflow indicates that the AutoPH4 component of the workflow generates high-quality pharmacophores, making AutoPH4 promising for use in future virtual screening workflows as well, such as ones that use conformations generated by MD simulations.",

        "Abstract": "Ideally, guidelines reflect an accepted position with respect to matters of concern, ranging from clinical practices to researcher behaviour. Upon close reading, authorship guidelines reserve authorship attribution to individuals fully or almost fully embedded in particular studies, including design or execution as well as significant involvement in the writing process. These requirements prescribe an organisation of scientific work in which this embedding is specifically enabled. Drawing from interviews with nutrition scientists at universities and in the food industry, we demonstrate that the organisation of research labour can deviate significantly from such prescriptions. The organisation of labour, regardless of its content, then, has consequences for who qualifies as an author. The fact that fewer food industry employees qualify is actively used by the food industry to manage the credibility and ownership of their knowledge claims as allonymous science: the attribution of science assisted by authorship guidelines blind to all but one organisational frame.",

        "Abstract": "It is well known that families frequently overrule the wishes of dying patients who had previously expressed a wish to donate their organs. Various strategies have been suggested to reduce the frequency of these 'family overrules'. However, the possibility of families overruling a patient's registered decision not to donate has not been discussed in the medical literature, although it is legally possible in some countries. In this article, we provide an ethical analysis of family overrule of a relative's refusal to donate, using the different jurisdictions of the UK, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands to provide some context. Despite some asymmetries between overruling consent and overruling refusal, there are some cases in which donation should proceed despite a recorded refusal to do so.",

        "Abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which in isolation do not adopt a well-defined tertiary structure but instead populate a structurally heterogeneous ensemble of interconverting states, play important roles in many biological pathways. IDPs often fold into ordered states upon binding to their physiological interaction partners (a so-called \"folding-upon-binding\" process), but it has proven difficult to obtain an atomic-level description of the structural mechanisms by which they do so. Here, we describe in atomic detail the folding-upon-binding mechanism of an IDP segment to its binding partner, as observed in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. In our simulations, we observed over 70 binding and unbinding events between the α-helical molecular recognition element (α-MoRE) of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein (N",

        "Abstract": "The distribution of credit, resources and opportunities in science is heavily skewed due to unjust practices and incentives, hardwired into science's rules, guidelines and conventions. A form of resistance widely available is to break those rules. We review instances of rule-breaking in scientific authorship to allow for a redefinition of the concept of civil disobedience in the context of academic research, as well as the conditions on which the label applies. We show that, in contrast to whistleblowing or conscientious objection, civil disobedience targets science's injustice on a more systemic level. Its further development will ease critical evaluation of deviant actions as well as helping us evaluate deviance, defiance and discontent in science beyond issues of authorship. However, empirically, civil disobedience in science engenders uncertainties and disagreements on the local status of both act and label.",

        "Abstract": "Big Data and Internet and Communication Technologies (ICT) are being increasingly implemented in the healthcare sector. Similarly, research in the field of dental medicine is exploring the potential beneficial uses of digital data both for dental practice and in research. As digitalization is raising numerous novel and unpredictable ethical challenges in the biomedical context, our purpose in this study is to map the debate on the currently discussed ethical issues in digital dentistry through a systematic review of the literature. Four databases (Web of Science, Pub Med, Scopus, and Cinahl) were systematically searched. The study results highlight how most of the issues discussed by the retrieved literature are in line with the ethical challenges that digital technologies are introducing in healthcare such as privacy, anonymity, security, and informed consent. In addition, image forgery aimed at scientific misconduct and insurance fraud was frequently reported, together with issues of online professionalism and commercial interests sought through digital means.",

        "Abstract": "Genetic testing decision-making for cancer predisposition is inherently complex. Understanding the mechanisms and influencing factors of the decision-making process is essential for genetic counselling and has not yet been investigated in Switzerland. This study's aim is thus to provide a theory about the individual's decision-making process regarding genetic testing for cancer predispositions in order to provide medical geneticists and genetic counsellors with insights into the needs and expectations of counsellees. We interviewed at-risk individuals who underwent genetic counselling in a clinical setting in Switzerland, using a grounded theory approach. Based on the interview data, we propose that a control-fate continuum, which is part of the individuals' life philosophy, importantly influences the decision-making process. Those in need for control decide differently compared with those leaving their future to fate. Several psychosocial factors influence the position on the control-fate continuum: \"looking for certainty\"; \"anticipating consequences\"; \"being socially influenced\"; \"simplifying risks\"; and \"deciding intuitively vs reflectively\". The control-fate continuum theory gives insights into the possible reasons behind decision-making regarding genetic testing for cancer predispositions. It includes both acceptors and decliners of genetic testing. Our theory helps healthcare professionals offering genetic counselling to anticipate problems within at-risk families and adapting their services to people's needs.",

        "Abstract": "The evaluation of electrostatic energy for a set of point charges in a periodic lattice is a computationally expensive part of molecular dynamics simulations (and other applications) because of the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction. A standard approach is to decompose the Coulomb potential into a near part, typically evaluated by direct summation up to a cutoff radius, and a far part, typically evaluated in Fourier space. In practice, all decomposition approaches involve approximations-such as cutting off the near-part direct sum-but it may be possible to find new decompositions with improved trade-offs between accuracy and performance. Here, we present the u-series, a new decomposition of the Coulomb potential that is more accurate than the standard (Ewald) decomposition for a given amount of computational effort and achieves the same accuracy as the Ewald decomposition with approximately half the computational effort. These improvements, which we demonstrate numerically using a lipid membrane system, arise because the u-series is smooth on the entire real axis and exact up to the cutoff radius. Additional performance improvements over the Ewald decomposition may be possible in certain situations because the far part of the u-series is a sum of Gaussians and can thus be evaluated using algorithms that require a separable convolution kernel; we describe one such algorithm that reduces communication latency at the expense of communication bandwidth and computation, a trade-off that may be advantageous on modern massively parallel supercomputers.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, the roots of left-hand traffic (LHT) and right-hand traffic (RHT) - including fighting on horse-back and whipping horses that are drawing carriages - are at an all-time low; thus, it is time to assess and appreciate the nexus of road-safety practices and human neurophysiology. We hypothesize that safety of LHT and RHT can be associated with neurophysiology. We summarize scattered empirical research into plausible links between neurophysiological aspects such as handedness, eye movement bias, and hemispheric lateralisation and how safe, in theory, LHT vs. RHT may be for whom. The scarcity and limitations of empirical data into road traffic accidents associated with LHT or RHT are surprising. Even though it was claimed that countries with LHT have lower collision rates than countries with RHT some 50 years ago, we lack informative analyses of traffic accidents in countries with either LHT or RHT which consider plausibly associated neurophysiology. Overall, we predict that LHT (with the driver sitting on the right) is safer than RHT. As 'the rule of the road' and neurophysiology may have important unrecognized \"side\" effects, we suggest that (and how) this rationale should be tested.",

        "Abstract": "Precision medicine (PM) is an emerging approach to individualized care. It aims to help physicians better comprehend and predict the needs of their patients while effectively adopting in a timely manner the most suitable treatment by promoting the sharing of health data and the implementation of learning healthcare systems. Alongside its promises, PM also entails the risk of exacerbating healthcare inequalities, in particular between ethnoracial groups. One often-neglected underlying reason why this might happen is the impact of structural racism on PM initiatives. Raising awareness as to how structural racism can influence PM initiatives is paramount to avoid that PM ends up reproducing the pre-existing health inequalities between different ethnoracial groups and contributing to the loss of trust in healthcare by minority groups.",

The whistleblower works for Project Nightingale, an attempt by Google to get into the lucrative US healthcare market, by storing and processing the personal medical data of up to 50 million customers of Ascension, one of America's largest healthcare providers. As the Wall Street Journal had already reported 3 days earlier, and as the whistleblower confirmed, neither was the data anonymized when transmitted from Ascension nor were patients or their doctors notified, let alone asked for consent to sharing their data with Google (Copeland, 2019; Pilkington, 2019). As a result, Google employees had full access to non-anonymous patient health data. Google Health chief David Feinberg commented that all Google employees involved had gone through medical ethics training and were approved by Ascension (Feinberg, 2019).",

        "Abstract": "The accuracy of atomistic physics-based force fields for the simulation of biological macromolecules has typically been benchmarked experimentally using biophysical data from simple, often single-chain systems. In the case of proteins, the careful refinement of force field parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials and the use of improved water models have enabled a great deal of progress toward the highly accurate simulation of such monomeric systems in both folded and, more recently, disordered states. In living organisms, however, proteins constantly interact with other macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, and these interactions are often essential for proper biological function. Here, we show that state-of-the-art force fields tuned to provide an accurate description of both ordered and disordered proteins can be limited in their ability to accurately describe protein-protein complexes. This observation prompted us to perform an extensive reparameterization of one variant of the Amber protein force field. Our objective involved refitting not only the parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials but also the parameters used to model nonbonded interactions, the specification of which is expected to be central to the accurate description of multicomponent systems. The resulting force field, which we call ",

Surgical repair remains the gold-standard in moderate to severe aortic injuries. In the last decade however, endovascular treatment has gained popularity in children who have suitable vascular anatomy for intervention and are either not fit for surgery or in whom, endovascular intervention is the only alternative that will make a difference in the clinical outcome. Children pose a unique set of challenges to endovascular therapy. In this article, we aim to illustrate the different endovascular options that are available for the treatment of acute traumatic aortic injury and visceral thromboembolisation through pictorial representation. We will also demonstrate the feasibility and the limitation of this technique.",

        "Abstract": "Ketone bodies (KB) provide an alternative energy source and uniquely modulate substrate metabolism during endurance exercise. Nutritional ketosis (blood KBs > 0.5 mM) can be achieved within minutes via exogenous ketone supplementation or days-to-weeks via conforming to a very low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (KD). In contrast to short-term (< 2 weeks) KD ingestion, chronic adherence (> 3 weeks) leads to a state of keto-adaptation. However, despite elevating blood KBs to similar concentrations, exogenous ketone supplementation and keto-adaptation are not similar metabolic states as they elicit diverse and distinct effects on substrate availability and metabolism during exercise; meaning that their influence on endurance exercise performance is different. In contrast to contemporary, high(er)-carbohydrate fuelling strategies, inducing nutritional ketosis is rarely ergogenic irrespective of origin and, in fact, can impair endurance performance. Nonetheless, exogenous ketone supplementation and keto-adaptation possess utility for select endurance events and individuals, thus warranting further research into their performance effects and potential strategies for their optimisation. It is critical, however, that future research considers the limitations of measuring blood KB concentrations and their utilisation, and assess the effect of nutritional ketosis on performance using exercise protocols reflective of real-world competition. Furthermore, to reliably assess the effects of keto-adaptation, rigorous dietary-training controls of sufficient duration should be prioritised.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to analyze the attitudes and reactions of researchers towards an authorship claim made by a researcher in a position of authority who has not made any scientific contribution to a manuscript or helped to write it. This paper draws on semi-structured interviews conducted with 33 researchers at three seniority levels working in biomedicine and the life sciences in Switzerland. This manuscript focuses on the analysis of participants' responses when presented with a vignette describing an authorship assignment dilemma within a research group. The analysis indicates that researchers use a variety of explanations and arguments to justify inclusion of what guidelines would describe as honorary or guest authorship. Fuzzy parameters such as \"substantial contribution\" lead to varied interpretation and consequently convenient application of authorship guidelines in practice. Factors such as the culture of the research group, the values and practice shaped by the research leaders, the hierarchy and relative (perceived) positions of power within research institutions, and the importance given to publications as the currency for academic success and growth tend to have a strong influence on authorship practice. Unjustified authorship assignment practices can be reduced to some extent by creating empowering research cultures where each researcher irrespective of his/her career stage feels empowered to confidently raise concerns without fearing adverse impact on their professional lives. However, individual researchers and research institutions currently have limited influence on established methods for evaluating academic success, which is primarily based on the number of high impact publications.",

        "Abstract": "Linalool is an enanitomer monoterpene compound identified as the pharmacologically active constituent in a number of essential oils and has been reported to display anxiolytic properties in humans and in animal models and to exert both GABAergic and glutamatergic effects. In Experiment 1 linalool (100, 200, and 300, i.p.) had no significant effects compared with saline in an activity tracker with C57BL/6j mice. Experiment 2 assessed the effects on operant extinction with mice of chlordiazepoxide at a dose (15 mg/kg, i.p.) previously shown to facilitate extinction, and the same doses of linalool, compared with saline. Linalool had a dose-related facilitatory effect on extinction. While the effects of the highest dose of linalool most closely resembled the effects of chlordiazepoxide, the pattern of results suggested that linalool may affect both the acquisition of extinction learning, which is influenced by glutamatergic processes, and the expression of extinction, known to be affected by GABAergic agents such as chlordiazepoxide.",

        "Title": "Tree growth declines and mortality were associated with a parasitic plant during warm and dry climatic conditions in a temperate coniferous forest ecosystem.",
        "Abstract": "Insects and pathogens are widely recognized as contributing to increased tree vulnerability to the projected future increasing frequency of hot and dry conditions, but the role of parasitic plants is poorly understood even though they are common throughout temperate coniferous forests in the western United States. We investigated the influence of western hemlock dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium tsugense) on large (≥45.7 cm diameter) western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) growth and mortality in a 500 year old coniferous forest at the Wind River Experimental Forest, Washington State, United States. We used five repeated measurements from a long-term tree record for 1,395 T. heterophylla individuals. Data were collected across a time gradient (1991-2014) capturing temperature increases and precipitation decreases. The dwarf mistletoe rating (DMR), a measure of infection intensity, varied among individuals. Our results indicated that warmer and drier conditions amplified dwarf mistletoe effects on T. heterophylla tree growth and mortality. We found that heavy infection (i.e., high DMR) resulted in reduced growth during all four measurement intervals, but during warm and dry intervals (a) growth declined across the entire population regardless of DMR level, and (b) both moderate and heavy infections resulted in greater growth declines compared to light infection levels. Mortality rates increased from cooler-wetter to warmer-drier measurement intervals, in part reflecting increasing mortality with decreasing tree growth. Mortality rates were positively related to DMR, but only during the warm and dry measurement intervals. These results imply that parasitic plants like dwarf mistletoe can amplify the impact of climatic stressors of trees, contributing to the vulnerability of forest landscapes to climate-induced productivity losses and mortality events.",

        "Abstract": "In the framework of digital health, mobile applications with health-related content are increasing in number and importance. Many of these apps are targeted at the general public and, although they differ in features and purposes, their functions are often based on the promotion of health and the monitoring of customers&rsquo; lifestyle data. Apps of this type have also recently been developed by health insurance companies. In many cases, insurers&rsquo; apps do not simply offer health-related recommendations to the users, but also provide economic incentives to those customers who agree to share their behavioural data through the applications. Although such apps may contribute to the adoption of a health-conscious lifestyle, the fact that they require the sharing of dense individual data with the companies responsible for insurance coverage raises some relevant ethical issues. This paper investigates the phenomenon of insurers&rsquo; apps permitting customers to share their data in exchange for monetary rewards currently available in Switzerland. After describing the features and functioning of the apps, we present some ethically relevant aspects related to their use. More specifically, we discuss the issues of transparency of data-sharing purposes, potential discrimination amongst insured people, &ldquo;quantification&rdquo; of the users and, finally, the potential tension generated between solidarity and responsibility. We conclude by emphasising that these apps are becoming a new paradigm for insurers in many countries and that a thorough assessment of their ethical and societal implications is required. &nbsp.",

Although the media has tended to focus on the potential benefits and ethical issues relating to the main change from an opt-in default to an opt-out one, other defaults will also change, while some will remain the same. Interaction of these other defaults with the principal one raise several ethical issues that may complicate efforts to use deemed consent to increase donation rates. Most significantly, changing the main default will have the effect of changing the default for patients' families, who play a vital role in the consent process.",

Quantifying the effect of motifs on mutation rates is challenging: a large number of possible motifs makes this statistical problem high dimensional, while the unobserved history of the mutation process leads to a nontrivial missing data problem.

        "Abstract": "Indoor air is subject to emissions of chemicals from numerous sources. Many of these emissions contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which react to form a wide range of secondary products, some with adverse health effects. However, at present we lack a robust, standardised approach to rank the potential for different VOCs to cause harm, which prevents effective action to improve indoor air quality and reduce impacts on human health. This paper uses a detailed chemical model to quantify the impact of 63 VOCs on indoor air quality. We define a novel method for ranking the VOCs in terms of potentially harmful product formation through a new metric, the Secondary Product Creation Potential (SPCP). We established SPCPs for a range of ventilation rates, different proportions of transmitted outdoor light, as well as for varying outdoor concentrations of ozone and nitrogen oxides. The species having the largest SPCPs are the alkenes, terpenes and aromatic VOCs. trans-2-Butene has the largest individual SPCP owing to the ratio of its rate coefficient for reaction with the hydroxy radical relative to ozone. Increasing the proportion of outdoor transmitted light increased most SPCPs markedly. This is because oxidant levels increased under these conditions and promoted more chemical processing, suggesting that there may be more harmful products closer to a window than further from the attenuated outdoor light. The SPCP is the first metric for assessing the impact of different VOCs on human health and will be an essential tool for guiding the composition of products commonly used indoors.",

        "Abstract": "Maximum likelihood estimation in phylogenetics requires a means of handling unknown ancestral states. Classical maximum likelihood averages over these unknown intermediate states, leading to provably consistent estimation of the topology and continuous model parameters. Recently, a computationally efficient approach has been proposed to jointly maximize over these unknown states and phylogenetic parameters. Although this method of joint maximum likelihood estimation can obtain estimates more quickly, its properties as an estimator are not yet clear. In this article, we show that this method of jointly estimating phylogenetic parameters along with ancestral states is not consistent in general. We find a sizeable region of parameter space that generates data on a four-taxon tree for which this joint method estimates the internal branch length to be exactly zero, even in the limit of infinite-length sequences. More generally, we show that this joint method only estimates branch lengths correctly on a set of measure zero. We show empirically that branch length estimates are systematically biased downward, even for short branches.",

This is actually a problem not only of public health and ethics, but also of big data-not only in terms of all the different data that could be used to inform such decisions, but also in the sense of deciding how wide the scope of data should be. We identify three key different types of data, including basic data, advanced data and preference data, provide an ethical analysis of the use of these different types of data and of different ways of prioritizing between pedestrians and passengers, and propose four rules that can help set ethical priorities for ethical data use and decision making by automated vehicles.",

        "Abstract": "Families play an essential role in deceased organ procurement. As the person cannot directly communicate his or her wishes regarding donation, the family is often the only source of information regarding consent or refusal. We provide a systematic description and analysis of the different roles the family can play, and actions the family can take, in the organ procurement process across different jurisdictions and consent systems. First, families can inform or update healthcare professionals about a person's donation wishes. Second, families can authorize organ procurement in the absence of deceased's preferences and the default is not to remove organs, and oppose donation where there is no evidence of preference but the default is to presume consent; in both cases, the decision could be based on their own wishes or what they think the deceased would have wanted. Finally, families can overrule the known wishes of the deceased, which can mean preventing donation, or permitting donation when the deceased refused it. We propose a schema of 4 levels on which to map these possible family roles: no role, witness, surrogate, and full decisional authority. We conclude by mapping different jurisdictions onto this schema to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the consent system for organ donation and some important nuances about the role of families. This classificatory model aims to account for the majority of the world's consent systems. It provides conceptual and methodological guidance that can be useful to researchers, professionals, and policymakers involved in organ procurement.",

        "Abstract": "A \"fragment hit\", a molecule of low molecular weight that has been validated to bind to a target protein, can be an effective chemical starting point for a drug discovery project. Our ability to find and progress fragment hits could potentially be improved by enhancing our understanding of their binding properties, which to date has largely been based on tacit knowledge and reports from individual projects. In the work reported here, we systematically analyzed the molecular and binding properties of fragment hits using 489 published protein-fragment complexes. We identified a number of notable features that these hits tend to have in common, including preferences in buried surface area upon binding, hydrogen bonding and other directional interactions with the protein targets, structural topology, functional-group occurrence, and degree of carbon saturation. In the future, taking account of these preferences in designing and selecting fragments to screen against protein targets may increase the chances of success in fragment screening campaigns.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the biological importance of protein-protein complexes, determining their structures and association mechanisms remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we report the results of atomic-level simulations in which we observed five protein-protein pairs repeatedly associate to, and dissociate from, their experimentally determined native complexes using a molecular dynamics (MD)-based sampling approach that does not make use of any prior structural information about the complexes. To study association mechanisms, we performed additional, conventional MD simulations, in which we observed numerous spontaneous association events. A shared feature of native association for these five structurally and functionally diverse protein systems was that if the proteins made contact far from the native interface, the native state was reached by dissociation and eventual reassociation near the native interface, rather than by extensive interfacial exploration while the proteins remained in contact. At the transition state (the conformational ensemble from which association to the native complex and dissociation are equally likely), the protein-protein interfaces were still highly hydrated, and no more than 20% of native contacts had formed.",

        "Abstract": "This study investigated the effect of the racemic β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) precursor, R,S-1,3-butanediol (BD), on time-trial (TT) performance and tolerability. A repeated-measures, randomized, crossover study was conducted in nine trained male cyclists (age, 26.7 ± 5.2 years; body mass, 69.6 ± 8.4 kg; height, 1.82 ± 0.09 m; body mass index, 21.2 ± 1.5 kg/m2; VO2peak,63.9 ± 2.5 ml·kg-1·min-1; Wmax, 389.3 ± 50.4 W). Participants ingested 0.35 g/kg of BD or placebo 30 min before and 60 min during 85 min of steady-state exercise, which preceded a ∼25- to 35-min TT (i.e., 7 kJ/kg). The ingestion of BD increased blood D-βHB concentration throughout exercise (0.44-0.79 mmol/L) compared with placebo (0.11-0.16 mmol/L; all p < .001), which peaked 1 hr following the TT (1.38 ± 0.35 vs. 0.34 ± 0.24 mmol/L; p < .001). Serum glucose and blood lactate concentrations were not different between trials (all p > .05). BD ingestion increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production after 20 min of steady-state exercise (p = .002 and p = .032, respectively); however, no further effects on cardiorespiratory parameters were observed. Within the BD trial, moderate to severe gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in five participants, and low levels of dizziness, nausea, and euphoria were reported in two participants. However, this had no effect on TT duration (placebo, 28.5 ± 3.6 min; BD, 28.7 ± 3.2 min; p = .62) and average power output (placebo, 290.1 ± 53.7 W; BD, 286.4 ± 45.9 W; p = .50). These results suggest that BD has no benefit for endurance performance.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, health authorities have increased emphasis on demonstrating that a cell line, which is used for the generation of biologics, is clonally derived. Within the past few years, single-cell manipulation technologies, especially microfluidic drop-on-demand dispensing, have gained increased attention in the biopharmaceutical industry. This work discusses the development and characterization of a single-cell printing workflow followed by plate imaging. By combining single-cell printing and plate imaging with manual image verification it is possible to, (1) dramatically reduce the number of microtiter plates needed during the single-cell cloning of clinical cell lines, as compared with a limiting-dilution single-cell cloning workflow, and therefore reduce the number of high-resolution images acquired and stored and (2) achieve >99.99% assurance that the cell lines derived from this workflow are clonally derived. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

        "Title": "Atomic-Level Description of Protein Folding inside the GroEL Cavity.",
        "Abstract": "Chaperonins (ubiquitous facilitators of protein folding) sequester misfolded proteins within an internal cavity, thus preventing protein aggregation during the process of refolding. GroEL, a tetradecameric bacterial chaperonin, is one of the most studied chaperonins, but the role of the internal cavity in the refolding process is still unclear. It has been suggested that rather than simply isolating proteins while they refold, the GroEL cavity actively promotes protein folding. A detailed characterization of the folding dynamics and thermodynamics of protein substrates encapsulated within the cavity, however, has been difficult to obtain by experimental means, due to the system's complexity and the many steps in the folding cycle. Here, we examine the influence of the GroEL cavity on protein folding based on the results of unbiased, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We first verified that the computational setup, which uses a recently developed state-of-the-art force field that more accurately reproduces the aggregation propensity of unfolded states, could recapitulate the essential structural dynamics of GroEL. In these simulations, the GroEL tetradecamer was highly dynamic, transitioning among states corresponding to most of the structures that have been observed experimentally. We then simulated a small, unfolded protein both in the GroEL cavity and in bulk solution and compared the protein's folding process within these two environments. Inside the GroEL cavity, the unfolded protein interacted strongly with the disordered residues in GroEL's C-terminal tails. These interactions stabilized the protein's unfolded states relative to its compact states and increased the roughness of its folding free-energy surface, resulting in slower folding compared to the rate in solution. For larger proteins, which are more typical GroEL substrates, we speculate that these interactions may allow substrates to more quickly escape kinetic traps associated with compact, misfolded states, thereby actively promoting folding.",

        "Abstract": "In the context of deceased organ donation, donors are routinely tested for HIV, to check for suitability for organ donation. This article examines whether a donor's HIV status should be disclosed to the donor's next of kin. On the one hand, confidentiality requires that sensitive information not be disclosed, and a duty to respect confidentiality may persist after death. On the other hand, breaching confidentiality may benefit third parties at risk of having been infected by the organ donor, as it may permit them to be tested for HIV and seek treatment in case of positive results. We conclude that the duty to warn third parties surpasses the duty to respect confidentiality. However, in order to minimize risks linked to the breach of confidentiality, information should be restrained to only concerned third parties, that is, those susceptible to having been infected by the donor.",

        "Abstract": "Euthanasia is categorically prohibited in almost all countries throughout the world. In Belgium and the Netherlands, combining euthanasia and subsequent organ donation in a so-called donation after circulatory-death (DCD) procedure is feasible on legal and medical grounds, and is increasingly gaining social and ethical acceptance. However, heart transplantation after DCD is currently not performed in Belgium and the Netherlands after euthanasia due to concerns surrounding the prolonged warm ischemia time associated with DCD and its effect on subsequent heart function. A number of patients who undergo euthanasia explicitly express their wish to donate their organs in a \"living organ donation\" procedure, which then causes death. Assuming that euthanasia is permitted, as expressed in Dutch and Belgian legislation, this exploratory article addresses whether it is legally and ethically sound to donate organs, especially the heart, as a living donor and to perform euthanasia in the same procedure in a patient who fulfills the due diligence requirements for euthanasia.

        "Abstract": "This article describes and discusses the views of researchers on the significance of raising concerns about scientific misconduct in their work environment and the reasons or circumstances that might deter them from doing so. In this exploratory qualitative research study, we conducted in-depth interviews with 33 researchers working in life sciences and medicine. They represent three seniority levels and five universities across Switzerland. A large majority of respondents in this research study argued that failure to raise concerns about scientific misconduct compromises research integrity. This is an encouraging result demonstrating that researchers try to adhere to high ethical standards. However, further interaction with respondents highlighted that this correct ethical assessment does not lead researchers to take the consequent action of raising concerns. The factors that discourage researchers from raising concerns need to be addressed at the level of research groups, institutions, and by setting a positive precedent which helps them to believe in the system's ability to investigate concerns raised in a timely and professional manner. Training of researchers in research integrity related issues will have limited utility unless it is coupled with the creation of research culture where raising concerns is a standard practice of scientific and research activities.",

        "Abstract": "This article describes the Swiss law on advance directives that was passed at the beginning of 2013 and led to more certainty about the legally binding character of such directives. However, for various reasons the drafting of advance directives is not yet widespread in Switzerland, and many resources might be put to better use if this became a common practice. A recent proposal by members of a political party to make the discussion, although not the actual drafting, of advance directives mandatory was rejected by the Swiss Federal Parliament, and the proposal was written off after having been pending for 2 years. We consider that the rejection of this proposal was not justified and that discussion of advance directives should become mandatory, so that individuals can fully assume their role as responsible citizens taking proactive decisions. The decision not to draft advance directives should be a deliberate one, marking a shift from the current \"opt-in\" approach to an \"opt-out\" scenario.",

MGI provides comprehensive phenotypes for over 50,000 mutant alleles in mice and provides experimental model descriptions for over 1500 human diseases. Curated data from scientific publications are integrated with those from high-throughput phenotyping and gene expression centers. Data are standardized using defined, hierarchical vocabularies such as the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) Ontology, Mouse Developmental Anatomy and the Gene Ontologies (GO). This chapter introduces you to Gene and Allele Detail pages and provides step-by-step instructions for simple searches and those that take advantage of the breadth of MGI data integration.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a valuable tool for characterizing the structural dynamics of folded proteins and should be similarly applicable to disordered proteins and proteins with both folded and disordered regions. It has been unclear, however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins. Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The resulting force field, a99SB-",

        "Abstract": "Monoclonality of mammalian cell lines used for production of biologics is a regulatory expectation and one of the attributes assessed as part of a larger process to ensure consistent quality of the biologic. Historically, monoclonality has been demonstrated through statistics generated from limiting dilution cloning or through verified flow cytometry methods. A variety of new technologies are now on the market with the potential to offer more efficient and robust approaches to generating and documenting a clonal cell line.Here we present an industry perspective on approaches for the application of imaging and integration of that information into a regulatory submission to support a monoclonality claim. These approaches represent the views of a consortium of companies within the BioPhorum Development Group and include case studies utilising imaging technology that apply scientifically sound approaches and efforts in demonstrating monoclonality. By highlighting both the utility of these alternative approaches and the advantages they bring over the traditional methods, as well as their adoption by industry leaders, we hope to encourage acceptance of their use within the biologics cell line development space and provide guidance for regulatory submission using these alternative approaches.",

This paper focuses on different aspects of hope in the context of human health and well-being and explores the varieties of hope expressed by patients. The research findings are based on interview data collected from stable gout and diabetes patients. Three concepts of hope have emerged from the interviews: hope as certainty (H1); hope as reflective uncertainty (H2); hope as self-therapy (H3). The purpose of the paper is twofold. First, it aims to underline the significance of hope in patients' medical decision-making, as well as the beneficence of hope for patients' well-being, and for progress in research. Second, it shows how philosophical investigations-in particular Descartes-explore the phenomenon of hope and provide medical empirical research with profitable insights and tools.",

        "Abstract": "Researchers often refer to \"research integrity\", \"scientific integrity\", \"research misconduct\", \"scientific misconduct\" and \"research ethics\". However, they may use some of these terms interchangeably despite conceptual distinctions. The aim of this paper is to clarify what is signified by several key terms related to research integrity, and to suggest clearer conceptual delineation between them. To accomplish this task, it provides a conceptual analysis based upon definitions and general usage of these phrases and categorization of integrity-breaching behaviours in literature and guidelines, including clarification of the different domains and agents involved. In the first part of the analysis, following some initial clarifications, I explore the distinction between internal and external rules of integrity. In the second part, I explore the distinction between integrity and lack of misconduct, before suggesting a recategorisation of different types of integrity breach. I conclude that greater clarity is needed in the debate on research integrity. Distinguishing between scientific and research integrity, reassessing the relative gravity of different misbehaviours in light of this distinction, and recognising all intentional breaches of integrity as misconduct may help to improve guidelines and education.",

        "Abstract": "Haematophagous biting midges of the genus Culicoides are pests of humans, livestock, and wildlife, and some also serve as vectors of bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) worldwide. In North America, there are only two Culicoides spp. proven to transmit BTV and/or EHDV-Culicoides (Hoffmania) insignis Lutz (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) and Culicoides (Monoculicoides) sonorensis Wirth and Jones (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Culicoides sonorensis is considered the primary vector due to its wide distribution across much of North America, whereas C. insignis has a neotropical distribution historically limited to peninsular Florida. However, Culicoides surveys conducted 2007 to 2015 have detected the presence of C. insignis in five southeastern states (Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana), suggesting C. insignis has or is currently experiencing a northwestward range expansion in the southeastern United States. Because C. insignis has a neotropical distribution and is a known vector of BTV serotypes exotic to North America, an expanding range could pose an introduction risk of virus serotypes new to the region and/or increased transmission of circulating endemic serotypes.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we analyse the potential benefits and disadvantages of permitting healthcare professionals to invoke conscientious objection to deceased organ donation. There is some evidence that permitting doctors and nurses to register objections can ultimately lead to attitudinal change and acceptance of organ donation. However, while there may be grounds for conscientious objection in other cases such as abortion and euthanasia, the life-saving nature of donation and transplantation renders objection in this context more difficult to justify. In general, dialogue between healthcare professionals is a more appropriate solution, and any objections must be justified with a strong rationale in hospitals where such policies are put in place.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become a powerful tool for characterizing at an atomic level of detail the conformational changes undergone by proteins. The application of such simulations to RNA structures, however, has proven more challenging, due in large part to the fact that the physical models (\"force fields\") available for MD simulations of RNA molecules are substantially less accurate in many respects than those currently available for proteins. Here, we introduce an extensive revision of a widely used RNA force field in which the parameters have been modified, based on quantum mechanical calculations and existing experimental information, to more accurately reflect the fundamental forces that stabilize RNA structures. We evaluate these revised parameters through long-timescale MD simulations of a set of RNA molecules that covers a wide range of structural complexity, including single-stranded RNAs, RNA duplexes, RNA hairpins, and riboswitches. The structural and thermodynamic properties measured in these simulations exhibited dramatically improved agreement with experimentally determined values. Based on the comparisons we performed, this RNA force field appears to achieve a level of accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art protein force fields, thus significantly advancing the utility of MD simulation as a tool for elucidating the structural dynamics and function of RNA molecules and RNA-containing biological assemblies.",

        "Title": "Good collaborative practice: reforming capacity building governance of international health research partnerships.",
        "Abstract": "In line with the policy objectives of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this commentary seeks to examine the extent to which provisions of international health research guidance promote capacity building and equitable partnerships in global health research. Our evaluation finds that governance of collaborative research partnerships, and in particular capacity building, in resource-constrained settings is limited but has improved with the implementation guidance of the International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research Involving Humans by The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) (2016). However, more clarity is needed in national legislation, industry and ethics guidelines, and regulatory provisions to address the structural inequities and power imbalances inherent in international health research partnerships. Most notably, ethical partnership governance is not supported by the principal industry ethics guidelines - the International Conference on Harmonization Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceutical for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). Given the strategic value of ICH-GCP guidelines in defining the role and responsibility of global health research partners, we conclude that such governance should stipulate the minimal requirements for creating an equitable environment of inclusion, mutual learning, transparency and accountability. Procedurally, this can be supported by i) shared research agenda setting with local leadership, ii) capacity assessments, and iii) construction of a memorandum of understanding (MoU). Moreover, the requirement of capacity building needs to be coordinated amongst partners to support good collaborative practice and deliver on the public health goals of the research enterprise; improving local conditions of health and reducing global health inequality. In this respect, and in order to develop consistency between sources of research governance, ICH-GCP should reference CIOMS ethical guidelines as the established standard for collaborative partnership. Moreover, greater commitment and support should be given to co-ordinate, strengthen and enforce local laws requiring equitable research partnerships and health system strengthening.",

        "Abstract": "Despite increasing interest in integrity issues, relatively few studies have examined researchers' own interpretations of integrity. As part of the Perspectives on Research Integrity in Science and Medicine (PRISM) project, we sought to explore how researchers themselves define research integrity. We conducted 33 semi-structured interviews with clinical and laboratory-based researchers from across Switzerland. Data were transcribed and coded using thematic analysis and illustrative quotes were selected. Researchers defined integrity in terms of honesty, transparency, and objectivity, and generally stressed the importance of sticking to the research question and avoiding bias in data interpretation. Some saw research integrity as being synonymous with scientific integrity, but others regarded research integrity as being a subset of the wider domain of scientific integrity. A few participants equated research integrity with mere absence of misconduct, but the majority of participants regarded integrity as being more than this. Researchers regarded truth as the key aspect of integrity, though they expressed this in different ways and with various emphases on honesty, transparency, and objectivity. Integrity goes beyond avoiding misconduct, and scientific integrity has a wider domain than research integrity.",

We review the major insects and pathogens affecting the disturbance regime for coastal Douglas-fir forests in western Oregon and Washington State, USA, and ask how future climate changes may influence their role in disturbance ecology. Although the physiological constraints of light, temperature, and moisture largely control tree growth, episodic and chronic disturbances interacting with biological factors have substantial impacts on the structure and functioning of forest ecosystems in this region. Understanding insect and disease interactions is critical to predicting forest response to climate change and the consequences for ecosystem services, such as timber, clean water, fish and wildlife. We focused on future predictions for warmer wetter winters, hotter drier summers, and elevated atmospheric CO",

        "Abstract": "The reward infrastructure in science centres on publication, in which journal editors play a key role. Reward distribution hinges on value assessments performed by editors, who draw from plural value systems to judge manuscripts. This conceptual paper examines the numerous biases and other factors that affect editorial decisions. Hybrid and often conflicting value systems contribute to an infrastructure in which editors manage reward through editorial review, commissioned commentaries and reviews and weighing of peer review judgments. Taken together, these systems and processes push the editor into a role resembling censorship. Editors and authors both experience this phenomenon as an unintended side-effect of the reward infrastructure in science. To work towards a more constructive editor-author relationship, we propose a conversation, an exchange between editor and author in which value is collectively assessed (or constructed) as obligatory passage points in the publishing process are traversed. This paper contributes to the discourse on editorial practices by problematising editorial paradigms in a new way and suggesting solutions to entrenched problems.",

        "Abstract": "Faced with similar issues of organ scarcity to its neighbors, Switzerland has developed donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) as a way to expand the organ pool since 1985. Here, we analyze the history, practical considerations, and ethical issues relating to the Swiss donation after circulatory death programs. In Switzerland, determination of death for DCDD requires a stand-off period of 10 minutes. This time between cardiac arrest and the declaration of death is mandated in the guidelines of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences. As in other DCDD programs, safeguards are put to avoid physicians denying lifesaving treatment to savable patients because of being influenced by receivers' interest. An additional recommendation could be made: Recipients should be transparently informed of the worse graft outcomes with DCDD programs and given the possibility to refuse such organs.",

We conducted 52 key informant interviews with major stakeholders of an international multi-center PMVT (GSK/PATH-MVI RTS,S) (NCT00866619) in Ghana and Tanzania. Based on their stakeholder experiences, the responses fell into three main themes: (a) undue inducement, (b) community disparities, and (c) broad therapeutic misconceptions. The study identified the critical ethical aspects, from the perspectives of stakeholders, of delivering health care during a PMVT. The study showed that integrating research into health care services needs to be addressed in a manner that upholds the favorable risk-benefit ratio of research and attends to the health needs of local populations. The implementation of research should aim to improve local standards of care through building a collaborative agenda with local institutions and systems of health.",

On the basis of evidence from Cambridge and AT&T's Bell Laboratories, and as a condensation of the Janelia Experiment, an institutional focus on \"small groups\" and \"open doors\" may foster individual and group creativity. The evidence suggests that small organizational units of up to seven scientists and open door concepts could nurture interactions within and between groups and enhance the critical mass for individual and group creativity.",

        "Abstract": "Noncovalent interactions are of fundamental importance across the disciplines of chemistry, materials science, and biology. Quantum chemical calculations on noncovalently bound complexes, which allow for the quantification of properties such as binding energies and geometries, play an essential role in advancing our understanding of, and building models for, a vast array of complex processes involving molecular association or self-assembly. Because of its relatively modest computational cost, second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory is one of the most widely used methods in quantum chemistry for studying noncovalent interactions. MP2 is, however, plagued by serious errors due to its incomplete treatment of electron correlation, especially when modeling van der Waals interactions and π-stacked complexes. Here we present spin-network-scaled MP2 (SNS-MP2), a new semi-empirical MP2-based method for dimer interaction-energy calculations. To correct for errors in MP2, SNS-MP2 uses quantum chemical features of the complex under study in conjunction with a neural network to reweight terms appearing in the total MP2 interaction energy. The method has been trained on a new data set consisting of over 200 000 complete basis set (CBS)-extrapolated coupled-cluster interaction energies, which are considered the gold standard for chemical accuracy. SNS-MP2 predicts gold-standard binding energies of unseen test compounds with a mean absolute error of 0.04 kcal mol",

        "Title": "Transcriptomic changes in Echinochloa colona in response to treatment with the herbicide imazamox.",
        "Abstract": "Presented here is the first Echinochloa colona leaf transcriptome. Analysis of gene expression before and after herbicide treatment reveals that E. colona mounts a stress response upon exposure to herbicide. Herbicides are the most frequently used means of controlling weeds. For many herbicides, the target site is known; however, it is considerably less clear how plant gene expression changes in response to herbicide exposure. In this study, changes in gene expression in response to herbicide exposure in imazamox-sensitive (S) and- resistant (R) junglerice (Echinochloa colona L.) biotypes was examined. As no reference genome is available for this weed, a reference leaf transcriptome was generated. Messenger RNA was isolated from imazamox-treated- and untreated R and S plants and the resulting cDNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000. The transcriptome was assembled, annotated, and differential gene expression analysis was performed to identify transcripts that were upregulated or downregulated in response to herbicide exposure for both biotypes. Differentially expressed transcripts included transcription factors, protein-modifying enzymes, and enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling. A literature search revealed that members of the families represented in this analysis were known to be involved in abiotic stress response in other plants, suggesting that imazamox exposure induced a stress response. A time course study examining a subset of transcripts showed that expression peaked within 4-12 h and then returned to untreated levels within 48 h of exposure. Testing of plants from two additional biotypes showed a similar change in gene expression 4 h after herbicide exposure compared to the resistant and sensitive biotypes. This study shows that within 48 h junglerice mounts a stress response to imazamox exposure.",

        "Title": "T-cells and their cytokine production: The anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of strenuous exercise.",
        "Abstract": "Strenuous exercise bouts and heavy training are associated with a heightened anti-inflammatory state and a transient suppression of several immune components. In turn, many athletes are susceptible to illness, particularly upper respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, sore throat, running nose). T-lymphocytes (T-cells) are important for orchestrating the immune response and can be categorised into subsets according to their phenotypical characteristics resulting from polarisation (i.e. type-1, type-2 and regulatory T-cells). Each T-cell subset has a unique functional role, including their capacity to produce pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to an immune challenge. Prolonged and exhaustive exercise typically reduces peripheral blood type-1 T-cell number and their capacity to produce the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon-γ. Moreover, heavy training loads are associated with elevated numbers of resting peripheral blood type-2 and regulatory T-cells, which characteristically produce the anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-4 and interleukin-10, respectively. This appears to increase the risk of upper respiratory symptoms, potentially due to the cross-regulatory effect of interleukin-4 on interferon-γ production and immunosuppressive action of IL-10. Catecholamines significantly influence the number of peripheral blood T-cells in response to exercise. Whereas, glucocorticoids and prostaglandin E2 promote the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines by T-cells. In summary, strenuous exercise bouts and heavy training shifts T-cell immunity towards an anti-inflammatory state. This impairs the ability of the immune system to mount an inflammatory response to an immune challenge, which may weaken defences against intracellular pathogens (e.g. viruses), and increase the risk of infection and viral reactivation.",

A single limiting dilution step followed by direct imaging, as supplemental information, provides direct evidence that a cell line originated from a single progenitor cell. To obtain this evidence, a high-throughput automated imaging system was developed and characterized to consistently ensure that cell lines used for therapeutic protein production are clonally-derived. Fluorescent cell mixing studies determined that the automated imaging workflow and analysis provide ∼95% confidence in accurately and precisely identifying one cell in a well.

        "Abstract": "Establishing that a cell line was derived from a single cell progenitor and defined as clonally-derived for the production of clinical and commercial therapeutic protein drugs has been the subject of increased emphasis in cell line development (CLD). Several regulatory agencies have expressed that the prospective probability of clonality for CHO cell lines is assumed to follow the Poisson distribution based on the input cell count. The probability of obtaining monoclonal progenitors based on the Poisson distribution of all cells suggests that one round of limiting dilution may not be sufficient to assure the resulting cell lines are clonally-derived. We experimentally analyzed clonal derivatives originating from single cell cloning (SCC) via one round of limiting dilution, following our standard legacy cell line development practice. Two cell populations with stably integrated DNA spacers were mixed and subjected to SCC via limiting dilution. Cells were cultured in the presence of selection agent, screened, and ranked based on product titer. Post-SCC, the growing cell lines were screened by PCR analysis for the presence of identifying spacers. We observed that the percentage of nonclonal populations was below 9%, which is considerably lower than the determined probability based on the Poisson distribution of all cells. These results were further confirmed using fluorescence imaging of clonal derivatives originating from SCC via limiting dilution of mixed cell populations expressing GFP or RFP. Our results demonstrate that in the presence of selection agent, the Poisson distribution of all cells clearly underestimates the probability of obtaining clonally-derived cell lines. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

        "Abstract": "Many families refuse to consent to donation from their deceased relatives or over-rule the consent given before death by the patient, but giving families more information about the potential recipients of organs could reduce refusal rates. In this paper, we analyse arguments for and against doing so, and conclude that this strategy should be attempted. While it would be impractical and possibly unethical to give details of actual potential recipients, generic, realistic information about the people who could benefit from organs should be provided to families before they make a decision about donation or attempt to over-rule it.",

        "Title": "Geochemical landscapes as drivers of trace and toxic element profiles in wild red deer (Cervus elaphus).",
        "Abstract": "Tissue concentrations of essential trace and toxic elements in red deer (Cervus elaphus) are associated with the plants, soil and water they ingest. As such, variation in tissue concentrations is associated with variation in local geochemistry and bioavailability of elements. Physiological factors such as liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) infection, breeding status, and in-tissue element interactions may also affect tissue concentrations, though their effects in red deer are not well understood. The primary objective of this study was therefore to survey wild red deer liver element concentrations across a range of geographically distinct populations during the Scottish red deer stalking season; and, in so doing, establishes element reference ranges while also exploring geographic and temporal variation and physiological factors. Livers were sampled from carcasses intended for human consumption on nine hunting estates during two seasons (2012-13, 2013-14). Samples were digested and analysed by ICP-OES for essential trace elements (Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Se, Zn) and for Cd. Data (n=787) were modelled against cull location, date, and F. hepatica diagnosis. Interactions between elements within liver, and differences in element profiles between estates, were explored by principal component analysis. Our results revealed marked geographic variation in Cd, Cu and Se, where up to four-fold differences in median element concentrations occurred between estates, and, in males, Mn, Mo and Zn declined as the breeding season approached. In both sexes, within-liver associations (Cd-Cu-Se and Mn-Mo-Zn) were found. In females, liver Zn was greater on average in individuals that were not infected with F. hepatica. This study is the first to quantify geographic variation in Scottish red deer liver element concentrations; the drivers of which remain to be explored (and may be management related), and, the consequence of which may affect sub-clinical health.",

        "Abstract": "A quantitative characterization of the binding properties of drug fragments to a target protein is an important component of a fragment-based drug discovery program. Fragments typically have a weak binding affinity, however, making it challenging to experimentally characterize key binding properties, including binding sites, poses, and affinities. Direct simulation of the binding equilibrium by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide a computational route to characterize fragment binding, but this approach is so computationally intensive that it has thus far remained relatively unexplored. Here, we perform MD simulations of sufficient length to observe several different fragments spontaneously and repeatedly bind to and unbind from the protein FKBP, allowing the binding affinities, on- and off-rates, and relative occupancies of alternative binding sites and alternative poses within each binding site to be estimated, thereby illustrating the potential of long time scale MD as a quantitative tool for fragment-based drug discovery. The data from the long time scale fragment binding simulations reported here also provide a useful benchmark for testing alternative computational methods aimed at characterizing fragment binding properties. As an example, we calculated binding affinities for the same fragments using a standard free energy perturbation approach and found that the values agreed with those obtained from the fragment binding simulations within statistical error.",

In a utopian occupational world devoid of night-shifts or artificial light, Ford wants to experiment with \"working through the night\". To support Ford's project, Edison offers his patented electric lamps to \"turn nights into days\". An ethics committee [EC] does not approve the night-work experiment and Utopia's Food and Drug Administration [FDA] does not approve the potential medical device as safe for use by humans. According to the EC and FDA, complex effects on circadian biology and thus safety of work and light at night are not understood.

        "Title": "The Consequences of Vagueness in Consent to Organ Donation.",
        "Abstract": "In this article I argue that vagueness concerning consent to post-mortem organ donation causes considerable harm in several ways. First, the information provided to most people registering as organ donors is very vague in terms of what is actually involved in donation. Second, the vagueness regarding consent to donation increases the distress of families of patients who are potential organ donors, both during and following the discussion about donation. Third, vagueness also increases the chances that the patient's intention to donate will not be fulfilled due to the family's distress. Fourth, the consequent reduction in the number of donated organs leads to avoidable deaths and increased suffering among potential recipients, and distresses them and their families. There are three strategies which could be used to reduce the harmful effects of this vagueness. First, recategorizing the reasons (commonly referred to as 'overrules' under the current system) given by families who refuse donation from registered donors would bring greater clarity to donation discussions. Second, people who wish to donate their organs should be encouraged to discuss their wishes in detail with their families, and to consider recording their wishes in other ways. Finally, the consent system for organ donation could be made more detailed, ensuring both that more information is provided to potential donors and that they have more flexibility in how their intentions are indicated; this last strategy, however, could have the disadvantage of discouraging some potential donors from registering.",

        "Abstract": "The balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae (Ratzeburg) (Homoptera: Adelgidae)) (BWA) is a nonnative, invasive insect that threatens Abies species throughout North America. It is well established in the Pacific Northwest, but continues to move eastward through Idaho and into Montana and potentially threatens subalpine fir to the south in the central and southern Rocky Mountains. We developed a climatic risk model and map that predicts BWA impacts to subalpine fir using a two-step process. Using 30-year monthly climate normals from sites with quantitatively derived BWA damage severity index values, we built a regression model that significantly explained insect damage. The sites were grouped into two distinct damage categories (high damage and mortality versus little or no mortality and low damage) and the model estimates for each group were used to designate distinct value ranges for four climatic risk categories: minimal, low, moderate, and high. We then calculated model estimates for each cell of a 4-kilometer resolution climate raster and mapped the risk categories over the entire range of subalpine fir in the western United States. The spatial variation of risk classes indicates a gradient of climatic susceptibility generally decreasing from the Olympic Peninsula in Washington and the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington moving eastward, with the exception of some high risk areas in northern Idaho and western Montana. There is also a pattern of decreasing climatic susceptibility from north to south in the Rocky Mountains. Our study provides an initial step for modeling the relationship between climate and BWA damage severity across the range of subalpine fir. We showed that September minimum temperature and a metric calculated as the maximum May temperature divided by total May precipitation were the best climatic predictors of BWA severity. Although winter cold temperatures and summer heat have been shown to influence BWA impacts in other locations, these variables were not as predictive as spring and fall conditions in the Pacific Northwest.",

        "Title": "Family Over Rules? An Ethical Analysis of Allowing Families to Overrule Donation Intentions.",
        "Abstract": "Millions of people want to donate their organs after they die for transplantation, and many of them have registered their wish to do so or told their family and friends about their decision. For most of them, however, this wish is unlikely to be fulfilled, as only a small number of deaths (1% in the United Kingdom) occur in circumstances where the opportunity to donate organs is possible. Even for those who do die in the \"right\" way and have recorded their wishes or live in a jurisdiction with a \"presumed consent\" system, donation often does not go ahead because of another issue: their families refuse to allow donation to proceed. In some jurisdictions, the rate of \"family overrule\" is over 10%. In this article, we provide a systematic ethical analysis of the family overrule of donation of solid organs by deceased patients, and examine arguments both in favor of and against allowing relatives to \"veto\" the potential donor's intentions. First, we provide a brief review of the different consent systems in various European countries, and the ramifications for family overrule. Next, we describe and discuss the arguments in favor of permitting donation intentions to be overruled, and then the arguments against doing so. The \"pro\" arguments are: overrule minimises family distress and staff stress; families need to cooperate for donation to take place; families might have evidence regarding refusal; and failure to permit overrules could weaken trust in the donation system. The \"con\" arguments are: overrule violates the patient's wishes; the family is too distressed and will regret the decision; overruling harms other patients; and regulations prohibit overrule. We conclude with a general discussion and recommendations for dealing with families who wish to overrule donation. Overall, overrule should only rarely be permitted.",

We address key considerations concerning payment for participation in trials, including patient autonomy, risk/benefit and justice, taking account of two previous critiques of the ethics of P4. We conclude that such trials could be ethical under certain strict conditions, but only if other potential sources of funding have first been explored or are unavailable.",

The details regarding content and implementation were critical to the initial and subsequent success of this novel program. In this paper, we discuss the evidence-based advances, considerations, and pitfalls that we have encountered in the program's development through the discussion of four unanticipated tasks unique to a point-of-care ultrasound curriculum. The formatted discussion of these tasks will hopefully assist development of ultrasound programs at other institutions.",

Universities and funding bodies tend to prefer projects that involve interdisciplinarity, collaboration between different institutions, and international consortiums. Such projects can yield great benefits, but they also pose particular challenges for certain aspects of research integrity, and particularly for awarding credit and authorship. In this article, we describe and analyze the phenomenon of the ghost collaborator, who is initially fully involved and makes a full contribution to a project's design, but then finds him- or herself excluded from meetings and publications.",

Biosecurity concerns, deontological issues and human right aspects of genome editing have been the subject of in-depth debate; however, a lack of transparent regulatory guidelines, outdated governance codes, inefficient time-consuming clinical trial pathways and frequent misunderstanding of the scientific potential of cutting-edge technologies have created substantial obstacles to translational research in this area. While a precautionary principle should be applied at all stages of genome engineering research, the stigma of germline editing, synthesis of new life forms and unrealistic presentation of current technologies should not arrest the transition of new therapeutic, diagnostic or preventive tools from research to clinic. We provide a brief review on the present regulation of CRISPR and discuss the translational aspect of genome engineering research and patient autonomy with respect to the \"right to try\" potential novel non-germline gene therapies.",

        "Abstract": "We analyzed stable patients' views regarding synthetic biology in general, the medical application of synthetic biology, and their potential participation in trials of synthetic biology in particular. The aim of the study was to find out whether patients' views and preferences change after receiving more detailed information about synthetic biology and its clinical applications. The qualitative study was carried out with a purposive sample of 36 stable patients, who suffered from diabetes or gout. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, translated and fully anonymized. Thematic analysis was applied in order to examine stable patients' attitudes towards synthetic biology, its medical application, and their participation in trials. When patients were asked about synthetic biology in general, most of them were anxious that something uncontrollable could be created. After a concrete example of possible future treatment options, patients started to see synthetic biology in a more positive way. Our study constitutes an important first empirical insight into stable patients' views on synthetic biology and into the kind of fears triggered by the term \"synthetic biology.\" Our results show that clear and concrete information can change patients' initial negative feelings towards synthetic biology. Information should thus be transmitted with great accuracy and transparency in order to reduce irrational fears of patients and to minimize the risk that researchers present facts too positively for the purposes of persuading patients to participate in clinical trials. Potential participants need to be adequately informed in order to be able to autonomously decide whether to participate in human subject research involving synthetic biology.",

In all, 6 prisoners and 3 stakeholders spontaneously expressed their attitudes concerning assisted suicide. Some prisoners seek assisted suicide for medical reasons and others because they regard spending the rest of their lives in prison as undignified. However, stakeholders identified several ethical and practical challenges in providing assisted suicide to prisoners. This article presents these perspectives on assisted suicide in prison and provides an ethical analysis of the issues raised.",

        "Abstract": "Human ubiquitin has been extensively characterized using a variety of experimental and computational methods and has become an important model for studying protein dynamics. Nevertheless, it has proven difficult to characterize the microsecond time scale dynamics of this protein with atomistic resolution. Here we use an unbiased computer simulation to describe the structural dynamics of ubiquitin on the picosecond to millisecond time scale. In the simulation, ubiquitin interconverts between a small number of distinct states on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. We find that the conformations visited by free ubiquitin in solution are very similar to those found various crystal structures of ubiquitin in complex with other proteins, a finding in line with previous experimental studies. We also observe weak but statistically significant correlated motions throughout the protein, including long-range concerted movement across the entire β sheet, consistent with recent experimental observations. We expect that the detailed atomistic description of ubiquitin dynamics provided by this unbiased simulation may be useful in interpreting current and future experiments on this protein.",

        "Abstract": "A range of interventions in dying patients can improve both the possibility of successful organ donation and the likely long-term success of transplantation. The ethical and legal issues surrounding such interventions, which most frequently occur in the context of donation after circulatory determination of death, are complex, controversial and many remain unresolved. This is true with adults, but even more so with children, where the issue of organ donation and premortem interventions to facilitate it, are highly sensitive. Essentially, such interventions are being undertaken in dying children who cannot medically benefit from them, though arguments have been advanced that becoming a donor might be in a child's extended best interest. However, certain interventions carry a potential risk, although small, of direct harm and of course overall objections to child donation after circulatory determination of death per se are still expressed in the literature. But, unlike the case in critically ill adults, those giving permission for such interventions are normally able to fully participate in decision-making, and indeed to consent, to both donation and premortem interventions. We review the issue of the use of premortem interventions in dying children to facilitate organ donation, including decision-making and ethical justification. Individual interventions are then considered, including an ethical analyse of their use. Finally, we recommend an approach using a combination of welfare checklist strategy, coupled with the establishment of an agreed zone of parental discretion about individual interventions which might be used in dying children to increase the possibility of successful organ donation.",

        "Abstract": "Organ-preserving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OP-ECMO) is defined as the use of extracorporeal support for the primary purpose of preserving organs for transplantation, rather than to save the patient's life. This paper discusses the ethics of using OP-ECMO in donation after brain determination of death (DBDD) to avoid the loss of organs for transplantation. We review case reports in the literature and analyze the ethical issues raised. We conclude that there is little additional ethical concern in continuing OP-ECMO in patients already on ECMO if they become brain dead. The implementation of OP-ECMO in hemodynamically unstable brain-dead patients is ethically permissible in certain clinical situations but requires specific consent from relatives if the patient's wish to donate is not clear. If no evidence of a patient's wish to donate is available, OP-ECMO is not recommended. In countries with presumed consent legislation, failure to opt out should be considered as a positive wish to donate. If a patient is not-yet brain-dead or is undergoing testing for brain death, OP-ECMO is not recommended. Further research on OP-ECMO is needed to better understand the attitudes of professionals, families, and lay people to ensure agreement on key ethical issues.",

        "Abstract": "Controlled donation after circulatory determination of death (cDCDD) concerns donation after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (W-LST). We examine the ethical issues raised by W-LST in the cDCDD context in the light of a review of cDCDD protocols and the ethical literature. Our analysis confirms that W-LST procedures vary considerably among cDCDD centers and that despite existing recommendations, the conflict of interest in the W-LST decision and process might be difficult to avoid, the process of W-LST might interfere with usual end-of-life care, and there is a risk of hastening death. In order to ensure that the practice of W-LST meets already well-established ethical recommendations, we suggest that W-LST should be managed in the ICU by an ICU physician who has been part of the W-LST decision. Recommending extubation for W-LST, when this is not necessarily the preferred procedure, is inconsistent with the recommendation to follow usual W-LST protocol. As the risk of conflicts of interest in the decision of W-LST and in the process of W-LST exists, this should be acknowledged and disclosed. Finally, when cDCDD programs interfere with W-LST and end-of-life care, this should be transparently disclosed to the family, and specific informed consent is necessary.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can describe protein motions in atomic detail, but transitions between protein conformational states sometimes take place on time scales that are infeasible or very expensive to reach by direct simulation. Enhanced sampling methods, the aim of which is to increase the sampling efficiency of MD simulations, have thus been extensively employed. The effectiveness of such methods when applied to complex biological systems like proteins, however, has been difficult to establish because even enhanced sampling simulations of such systems do not typically reach time scales at which convergence is extensive enough to reliably quantify sampling efficiency. Here, we obtain sufficiently converged simulations of three proteins to evaluate the performance of simulated tempering, a member of a widely used class of enhanced sampling methods that use elevated temperature to accelerate sampling. Simulated tempering simulations with individual lengths of up to 100 μs were compared to (previously published) conventional MD simulations with individual lengths of up to 1 ms. With two proteins, BPTI and ubiquitin, we evaluated the efficiency of sampling of conformational states near the native state, and for the third, the villin headpiece, we examined the rate of folding and unfolding. Our comparisons demonstrate that simulated tempering can consistently achieve a substantial sampling speedup of an order of magnitude or more relative to conventional MD.",
