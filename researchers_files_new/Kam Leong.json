We review the application of brain organoids in neural disorder modeling and emerging bioengineering methods to improve data collection and feature extraction at multiscale. The integration of multiscale engineering strategies and analytical methods has significant potential to advance insight into neurological disorders and accelerate drug development.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the impact of long-term opioid exposure on the embryonic brain is critical due to the surging number of pregnant mothers with opioid dependency. However, this has been limited by human brain inaccessibility and cross-species differences in animal models. Here, a human midbrain model is established that uses hiPSC-derived midbrain organoids to assess cell-type-specific responses to acute and chronic fentanyl treatment and fentanyl withdrawal. Single-cell mRNA sequencing of 25,510 cells from organoids in different treatment groups reveals that chronic fentanyl treatment arrests neuronal subtype specification during early midbrain development and alters synaptic activity and neuron projection. In contrast, acute fentanyl treatment increases dopamine release but does not significantly alter gene expression related to cell lineage development. These results provide the first examination of the effects of opioid exposure on human midbrain development at the single-cell level.",

        "Abstract": "Conventionally, nanocarriers are used to regulate the controlled release of therapeutic payloads. Increasingly, they can also be designed to have an intrinsic therapeutic effect. For example, a positively charged nanocarrier can bind damage-associated molecular patterns, inhibiting toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway activation and thus modulating inflammation. These nucleic acid-binding nanomaterials (NABNs), which scavenge pro-inflammatory stimuli, exist in diverse forms, ranging from soluble polymers to nanoparticles and 2D nanosheets. Unlike conventional drugs that primarily address inflammation symptoms, these NABPs target the upstream inflammation initiation pathway by removing the agonists responsible for inflammation. Many NABNs have demonstrated effectiveness in murine models of inflammatory diseases. However, these scavengers have not been systematically studied and compared within a single setting. Herein, we screen a subset of the most potent NABNs to define their relative efficiency in scavenging cell-free nucleic acids and inhibiting various TLR pathways. This study helps interpret existing in vivo results and provides insights into the future design of anti-inflammatory nanocarriers.",

        "Abstract": "Trauma and its associated complications, including dysregulated inflammatory responses, severe infection, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), continue to pose lethal threats worldwide. Following injury, cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs), categorized as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), are released from dying or dead cells, triggering local and systemic inflammatory responses and coagulation abnormalities that worsen disease progression. Harnessing cfNA scavenging strategies with biomaterials has emerged as a promising approach for treating posttrauma systemic inflammation. In this study, the effectiveness of cationic hyperbranched polyaminoglycosides derived from tobramycin (HPT) and disulfide-included HPT (ss-HPT) in scavenging cfNAs to mitigate posttrauma inflammation and hypercoagulation is investigated. Both cationic polymers demonstrate the ability to suppress DAMP-induced toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and hypercoagulation by efficiently scavenging cfNAs. Additionally, HPT and ss-HPT exhibit potent antibacterial efficacy attributed to the presence of tobramycin in their chemical composition. Furthermore, HPT and ss-HPT exhibit favorable modulatory effects on inflammation and therapeutic outcomes in a cecal ligation puncture (CLP) mouse abdominal trauma model. Notably, in vivo studies reveal that ss-HPT displayed high accumulation and retention in injured organs of traumatized mice while maintaining a higher biodegradation rate in healthy mice, contrasting with findings for HPT. Thus, functionalized ss-HPT, a bioreducible polyaminoglycoside, holds promise as an effective option to enhance therapeutic outcomes for trauma patients by alleviating posttrauma inflammation and coagulation complications.",

        "Abstract": "Effective delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 components is crucial to realizing the therapeutic potential. Although many delivery approaches have been developed for this application, oral delivery has not been explored due to the degradative nature of the gastrointestinal tract. For this issue, we developed a series of novel phenylboronic acid (PBA)-functionalized chitosan-polyethylenimine (CS-PEI) polymers for oral CRISPR delivery. PBA functionalization equipped the polyplex with higher stability, smooth transport across the mucus, and efficient endosomal escape and cytosolic unpackaging in the cells. From a library of 12 PBA-functionalized CS-PEI polyplexes, we identified a formulation that showed the most effective penetration in the intestinal mucosa after oral gavage to mice. The optimized formulation performed feasible CRISPR-mediated downregulation of the target protein and reduction in the downstream cholesterol. As the first oral CRISPR carrier, this study suggests the potential of addressing the needs of both local and systemic editing in a patient-compliant manner.",

        "Abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an effective treatment modality that is highly selective for tumor suppression and is a hopeful alternative to traditional cancer therapy. However, PTT-induced inflammatory responses may result in undesirable side effects including increased risks of tumor recurrence and metastasis. Here we developed multifunctional MnO nanoparticles as scavengers of proinflammatory molecules to alleviate the PTT-induced inflammatory response. The MnO nanoparticles improve the PTT therapy by (1) binding and scavenging proinflammatory molecules to inhibit the proinflammatory molecule-induced Toll-like receptors (TLR) activation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling; (2) inhibiting activated macrophage-induced macrophage recruitment; and (3) inhibiting tumor cell migration and invasion. In vivo experimental results showed that further treatment with MnO nanoparticles after laser therapy not only inhibited the PTT-induced inflammatory response and primary tumor recurrence but also significantly reduced tumor metastasis due to the scavenging activity. These findings suggest that MnO nanoparticles hold the potential for mitigating the therapy-induced severe inflammatory response and inhibiting tumor recurrence and metastasis.",

        "Abstract": "Periodontitis is a common type of inflammatory bone loss and a risk factor for systemic diseases. The pathogenesis of periodontitis involves inflammatory dysregulation, which represents a target for new therapeutic strategies to treat periodontitis. After establishing the correlation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) level with periodontitis in patient samples, we test the hypothesis that the cfDNA-scavenging approach will benefit periodontitis treatment. We create a nanoparticulate cfDNA scavenger specific for periodontitis by coating selenium-doped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (SeHANs) with cationic polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM-G3), namely G3@SeHANs, and compare the activities of G3@SeHANs with those of soluble PAMAM-G3 polymer. Both G3@SeHANs and PAMAM-G3 inhibit periodontitis-related proinflammation in vitro by scavenging cfDNA and alleviate inflammatory bone loss in a mouse model of ligature-induced periodontitis. G3@SeHANs also regulate the mononuclear phagocyte system in a periodontitis environment, promoting the M2 over the M1 macrophage phenotype. G3@SeHANs show greater therapeutic effects than PAMAM-G3 in reducing proinflammation and alveolar bone loss in vivo. Our findings demonstrate the importance of cfDNA in periodontitis and the potential for using hydroxyapatite-based nanoparticulate cfDNA scavengers to ameliorate periodontitis.",

        "Abstract": "We propose an ex vivo T cell expansion system that mimics natural antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for adoptive cell therapy (ACT). Microfiber scaffolds coated with dendritic cell (DC) membrane replicate physicochemical properties of dendritic cells specific for T cell activation such as rapid recognition by T cells, long duration of T cell tethering, and DC-specific co-stimulatory cues. The DC membrane-coated scaffold is first surface-immobilized with T cell stimulatory ligands, anti-CD3 (αCD3) and anti-CD28 (αCD28) antibodies, followed by adsorption of releasable interleukin-2 (IL-2). The scaffolds present both surface and soluble cues to T cells ex vivo in the same way that these cues are presented by natural APCs in vivo. We demonstrate that the DC-mimicking scaffold promotes greater polyclonal expansion of primary human T cells as compared to αCD3/αCD28-functionalized Dynabead. More importantly, major histocompatibility complex molecules derived from the DC membrane of the scaffold allow antigen-specific T cell expansion with target cell-specific killing ability. In addition, most of the expanded T cells (∼97%) can be harvested from the scaffold by density gradient centrifugation. Overall, the DC-mimicking scaffold offers a scalable, modular, and customizable platform for rapid expansion of highly functional T cells for ACT.",

Since the first engineered hearts were introduced over two decades ago, human induced pluripotent stem cell-based three-dimensional cardiac organoids and heart-on-a-chip systems have now become mainstays in basic cardiovascular research as valuable platforms for investigating fundamental human pathophysiology and development. However, major obstacles remain to be addressed before the field can truly advance toward commercial and clinical translation. Here we provide a snapshot of the state-of-the-art methods in cardiac tissue engineering, with a focus on in vitro models of the human heart.

        "Abstract": "Tremendous progress has been made in the past decade regarding our understanding of the gut microbiome's role in human health. Currently, however, a comprehensive and focused review marrying the two distinct fields of gut microbiome and material research is lacking. To bridge the gap, the current paper discusses critical aspects of the rapidly emerging research topic of \"material engineering in the gut microbiome and human health.\" By engaging scientists with diverse backgrounds in biomaterials, gut-microbiome axis, neuroscience, synthetic biology, tissue engineering, and biosensing in a dialogue, our goal is to accelerate the development of research tools for gut microbiome research and the development of therapeutics that target the gut microbiome. For this purpose, state-of-the-art knowledge is presented here on biomaterial technologies that facilitate the study, analysis, and manipulation of the gut microbiome, including intestinal organoids, gut-on-chip models, hydrogels for spatial mapping of gut microbiome compositions, microbiome biosensors, and oral bacteria delivery systems. In addition, a discussion is provided regarding the microbiome-gut-brain axis and the critical roles that biomaterials can play to investigate and regulate the axis. Lastly, perspectives are provided regarding future directions on how to develop and use novel biomaterials in gut microbiome research, as well as essential regulatory rules in clinical translation. In this way, we hope to inspire research into future biomaterial technologies to advance gut microbiome research and gut microbiome-based theragnostics.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammation plays an important role in the response to danger signals arising from damage to our body and in restoring homeostasis. Dysregulated inflammatory responses occur in many diseases, including cancer, sepsis and autoimmunity. The efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs, developed for the treatment of dysregulated inflammation, can be potentiated using biomaterials, by improving the bioavailability of drugs and by reducing side effects. In this Review, we first outline key elements and stages of the inflammatory environment and then discuss the design of biomaterials for different anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies. Biomaterials can be engineered to scavenge danger signals, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and cell-free DNA, in the early stages of inflammation. Materials can also be designed to prevent adhesive interactions of leukocytes and endothelial cells that initiate inflammatory responses. Furthermore, nanoscale platforms can deliver anti-inflammatory agents to inflammation sites. We conclude by discussing the challenges and opportunities for biomaterial innovations in addressing inflammation.",

        "Title": "Biomaterialomics: Data science-driven pathways to develop fourth-generation biomaterials.",
        "Abstract": "Conventional approaches to developing biomaterials and implants require intuitive tailoring of manufacturing protocols and biocompatibility assessment. This leads to longer development cycles, and high costs. To meet existing and unmet clinical needs, it is critical to accelerate the production of implantable biomaterials, implants and biomedical devices. Building on the Materials Genome Initiative, we define the concept 'biomaterialomics' as the integration of multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools throughout the entire pipeline of biomaterials development. The Data Science-driven approach is envisioned to bring together on a single platform, the computational tools, databases, experimental methods, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing) to develop the fourth-generation biomaterials and implants, whose clinical performance will be predicted using 'digital twins'. While analysing the key elements of the concept of 'biomaterialomics', significant emphasis has been put forward to effectively utilize high-throughput biocompatibility data together with multiscale physics-based models, E-platform/online databases of clinical studies, data science approaches, including metadata management, AI/ Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and uncertainty predictions. Such integrated formulation will allow one to adopt cross-disciplinary approaches to establish processing-structure-property (PSP) linkages. A few published studies from the lead author's research group serve as representative examples to illustrate the formulation and relevance of the 'Biomaterialomics' approaches for three emerging research themes, i.e. patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine. The increased adaptability of AI/ML tools in biomaterials science along with the training of the next generation researchers in data science are strongly recommended. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This leading opinion review paper emphasizes the need to integrate the concepts and algorithms of the data science with biomaterials science. Also, this paper emphasizes the need to establish a mathematically rigorous cross-disciplinary framework that will allow a systematic quantitative exploration and curation of critical biomaterials knowledge needed to drive objectively the innovation efforts within a suitable uncertainty quantification framework, as embodied in 'biomaterialomics' concept, which integrates multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like machine learning. The formulation of this approach has been demonstrated for patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Pain is one of the most common medical conditions and affects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. Current pain treatments mainly rely on opioid analgesics and remain unsatisfactory. The life-threatening side effects and addictive properties of opioids demand new therapeutic approaches. Nanomedicine may be able to address these challenges as it allows for sensitive and targeted treatments without some of the burdens associated with current clinical pain therapies. This review discusses the physiology of pain, the current landscape of pain treatment, novel targets for pain treatment, and recent and ongoing efforts to effectively treat pain using nanotechnology-based approaches. We highl ight advances in nanoparticle-based drug delivery to reduce side effects, gene therapy to tackle the source of pain, and nanomaterials-based scavenging to proactively mediate pain signaling.",

Great progress has been achieved in the development of novel light-driven drug delivery strategies with both breadth and depth. Light-controlled drug delivery platforms can be generally categorized into three groups: photochemical, photothermal, and photoisomerization-mediated therapies. Various advanced materials, such as metal nanoparticles, metal sulfides and oxides, metal-organic frameworks, carbon nanomaterials, upconversion nanoparticles, semiconductor nanoparticles, stimuli-responsive micelles, polymer- and liposome-based nanoparticles have been applied for light-stimulated drug delivery.

        "Abstract": "Biomimetic strategies are useful for designing potent vaccines. Decorating a nanoparticulate adjuvant with cell membrane fragments as the antigen-presenting source exemplifies, such as a promising strategy. For translation, a standardizable, consistent, and scalable approach for coating nanoadjuvant with the cell membrane is important. Here a turbulent mixing and self-assembly method called flash nanocomplexation (FNC) for producing cell membrane-coated nanovaccines in a scalable manner is demonstrated. The broad applicability of this FNC technique compared with bulk-sonication by using ten different core materials and multiple cell membrane types is shown. FNC-produced biomimetic nanoparticles have promising colloidal stability and narrow particle polydispersity, indicating an equal or more homogeneous coating compared to the bulk-sonication method. The potency of a nanovaccine comprised of B16-F10 cancer cell membrane decorating mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with the adjuvant CpG is then demonstrated. The FNC-fabricated nanovaccines when combined with anti-CTLA-4 show potency in lymph node targeting, DC antigen presentation, and T cell immune activation, leading to prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a melanoma mouse model. This study advances the design of a biomimetic nanovaccine enabled by a robust and versatile nanomanufacturing technique.",

Incorporation of stimulus-sensitive moieties into the carriers would lead to \"smart\" delivery systems. A further evolution would be to endow the carrier with a therapeutic function such that it no longer serves as a mere passive entity to release the drug at the target tissue but can be viewed as a therapeutic agent in itself. In this review, we will discuss recent and ongoing efforts over the past decade to design therapeutic drug carriers that confer a biological benefit, including ROS scavenging or generating, pro- or anti-inflammatory, and immuno-evasive properties, to enhance the overall therapeutic efficacy of the delivery systems.",

        "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis begins with the accumulation of cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins on blood vessel walls and progresses to endothelial cell dysfunction, monocyte adhesion, and foam cell formation. Endothelialized tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBVs) have previously been fabricated to recapitulate artery functionalities, including vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and endothelium activation. Here, the initiation of atherosclerosis is emulated by designing branched TEBVs (brTEBVs) of various geometries treated with enzyme-modified low-density-lipoprotein (eLDL) and TNF-α to induce endothelial cell dysfunction and adhesion of perfused human monocytes. Locations of monocyte adhesion under pulsatile flow are identified, and the hemodynamics in the brTEBVs are characterized using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Monocyte adhesion is greater at the side outlets than at the main outlets or inlets, and is greatest at larger side outlet branching angles (60° or 80° vs 45°). In PIV experiments, the branched side outlets are identified as atherosclerosis-prone areas where fluorescent particles show a transient swirling motion following flow pulses; in CFD simulations, side outlets with larger branching angles show higher vorticity magnitude and greater flow disturbance than other areas. These results suggest that the branched TEBVs with eLDL/TNF-α treatment provide a physiologically relevant model of early atherosclerosis for preclinical studies.",

        "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated a preexisting epidemic: the opioid crisis. Much literature has shown that the circumstances imposed by COVID-19, such as social distancing regulations, medical and financial instability, and increased mental health issues, have been detrimental to those with opioid use disorder (OUD). In addition, unexpected neurological sequelae in COVID-19 patients suggest that COVID-19 compromises neuroimmunity, induces hypoxia, and causes respiratory depression, provoking similar effects as those caused by opioid exposure. Combined conditions of COVID-19 and OUD could lead to exacerbated complications. With limited human in vivo options to study these complications, we suggest that iPSC-derived brain organoid models may serve as a useful platform to investigate the physiological connection between COVID-19 and OUD. This mini-review highlights the advances of brain organoids in other neuropsychiatric and infectious diseases and suggests their potential utility for investigating OUD and COVID-19, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "The burden of liver diseases is increasing worldwide, accounting for two million deaths annually. In the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in the basic and translational research of liver tissue engineering. Liver microtissues are small, three-dimensional hepatocyte cultures that recapitulate liver physiology and have been used in biomedical research and regenerative medicine. This review summarizes recent advances, challenges, and future directions in liver microtissue research. Cellular engineering approaches are used to sustain primary hepatocytes or produce hepatocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells and other adult tissues. Three-dimensional microtissues are generated by scaffold-free assembly or scaffold-assisted methods such as macroencapsulation, droplet microfluidics, and bioprinting. Optimization of the hepatic microenvironment entails incorporating the appropriate cell composition for enhanced cell-cell interactions and niche-specific signals, and creating scaffolds with desired chemical, mechanical and physical properties. Perfusion-based culture systems such as bioreactors and microfluidic systems are used to achieve efficient exchange of nutrients and soluble factors. Taken together, systematic optimization of liver microtissues is a multidisciplinary effort focused on creating liver cultures and on-chip models with greater structural complexity and physiological relevance for use in liver disease research, therapeutic development, and regenerative medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in CRISPR present attractive genome-editing toolsets for therapeutic strategies at the genetic level. Here, a liposome-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle (lipoMSN) is reported as an effective CRISPR delivery system for multiplex gene-editing in the liver. The MSN provides efficient loading of Cas9 plasmid as well as Cas9 protein/guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), while liposome-coating offers improved serum stability and enhanced cell uptake. Hypothesizing that loss-of-function mutation in the lipid-metabolism-related genes pcsk9, apoc3, and angptl3 would improve cardiovascular health by lowering blood cholesterol and triglycerides, the lipoMSN is used to deliver a combination of RNPs targeting these genes. When targeting a single gene, the lipoMSN achieved a 54% gene-editing efficiency, besting the state-of-art Lipofectamine CRISPRMax. For multiplexing, lipoMSN maintained significant gene-editing at each gene target despite reduced dosage of target-specific RNP. By delivering combinations of targeting RNPs in the same nanoparticle, synergistic effects on lipid metabolism are observed in vitro and vivo. These effects, such as a 50% decrease in serum cholesterol after 4 weeks of post-treatment with lipoMSN carrying both pcsk9 and angptl3-targeted RNPs, could not be reached with a single gene-editing approach. Taken together, this lipoMSN represents a versatile platform for the development of efficient, combinatorial gene-editing therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Though the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is vital for the maintenance of brain homeostasis, it also accounts for a high attrition rate of therapies targeting the central nervous system (CNS). The challenge of delivery across the BBB is attributed to a combination of low permeability through an endothelium closely knit by tight and adherens junctions, extremely low rates of endothelial transcytosis, and efflux transporters. In the past decade, enormous research efforts have been spent to develop BBB penetration strategies using biochemical or physical stimuli, aided by BBB-on-chips or microphysiological BBB models to facilitate in vitro studies. Here, we discuss recent advances in BBB-chip technology that have enabled effective preclinical screenings of brain targeting therapeutics and external stimulation, such as sonoporation and electroporation, for improved BBB penetration.",

Localized delivery of immunomodulators to activate anticancer immunity in situ avoids overactivation of the systemic immune system and reduces side effects.

Nanomedicine holds exciting potential in modulating inflammation. In particular, cell membranes derived from cells involved in the inflammatory process may be used to coat nanotherapeutics for effective targeted delivery to inflammatory tissues.

        "Abstract": "Efficiency of drug and gene delivery via nonviral vehicles is contingent on proper cellular uptake and intracellular release. Further, various cargos, such as nucleases for gene editing or inhibitors for endosomal receptors, require transport to specific compartments of the cell. Hence, characterization of cellular uptake and endocytic pathways is crucial for the optimization of any nanoparticle-mediated intracellular delivery system. Previous work on endocytic pathways looks at the effect of various pathway inhibitors on the uptake efficiency of nanoparticles carrying fluorescently-labeled cargo. While this helps attribute particle uptake to specific pathways like caveolae-mediated or clathrin-mediated endocytosis, this does not provide a holistic picture of the delivery process. Here, we provide a general protocol that combines systematic studies of inhibitor effects on efficiency with quantification of particle-induced cell membrane permeability. By applying this methodology to a nucleic acid delivery system, for example a helical polypeptide-based nanoparticle for plasmid and guide RNA delivery, we gain understanding of the endocytic mechanisms and cell uptake for intelligent design of intracellular delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) has been increasingly applied to cancer therapy because of its tumor-tropic capability. However, short retention at target tissue and limited payload option hinder the progress of MSC-based cancer therapy. Herein, we proposed a hybrid spheroid/nanomedicine system, comprising MSC spheroid entrapping drug-loaded nanocomposite, to address these limitations. Spheroid formulation enhanced MSC's tumor tropism and facilitated loading of different types of therapeutic payloads. This system acted as an active drug delivery platform seeking and specifically targeting glioblastoma cells. It enabled effective delivery of combinational protein and chemotherapeutic drugs by engineered MSC and nanocomposite, respectively. In an in vivo migration model, the hybrid spheroid showed higher nanocomposite retention in the tumor tissue compared with the single MSC approach, leading to enhanced tumor inhibition in a heterotopic glioblastoma murine model. Taken together, this system integrates the merits of cell- and nanoparticle- mediated drug delivery with the tumor-homing characteristics of MSC to advance targeted combinational cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy and also the second leading cause of cancer mortality in women globally. Strategies for early and precise detection of breast cancer cells are highly desired in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, we report on the efficient detection of HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer cells using an amplified signal scheme enabled by gold nanoclusters entrapped in mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). The utilization of MSNs as an excellent enzyme immobilization support and gold nanoclusters as an effective peroxidase mimic imparts high sensitivity to this detection platform. In addition, the inclusion of target-specific HER2 antibodies adds excellent selectivity. Determination of HER2+ cancer cells in breast cancer tissue demonstrates the potential application of this biosensor design in clinical diagnosis in particular, and bioanalysis in general.",

        "Abstract": "Cutaneous injuries, especially chronic wounds, burns, and skin wound infection, require painstakingly long-term treatment with an immense financial burden to healthcare systems worldwide. However, clinical management of chronic wounds remains unsatisfactory in many cases. Various strategies including growth factor and gene delivery as well as cell therapy have been used to enhance the healing of non-healing wounds. Drug delivery systems across the nano, micro, and macroscales can extend half-life, improve bioavailability, optimize pharmacokinetics, and decrease dosing frequency of drugs and genes. Replacement of the damaged skin tissue with substitutes comprising cell-laden scaffold can also restore the barrier and regulatory functions of skin at the wound site. This review covers comprehensively the advanced treatment strategies to improve the quality of wound healing.",

        "Abstract": "Molecularly, breast cancer represents a highly heterogenous family of neoplastic disorders, with substantial interpatient variations regarding genetic mutations, cell composition, transcriptional profiles, and treatment response. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for alternative diagnostic approaches aimed at the molecular annotation of the disease on a patient-by-patient basis and the design of more personalized treatments. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) technology enables the development of such novel approaches. For instance, in diagnostics, the use of the RNA-specific C2c2 system allows ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection and could be used to characterize the mutational repertoire and transcriptional breast cancer signatures. In disease modeling, CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be applied to selectively engineer oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes involved in disease pathogenesis. In treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to develop gene-therapy, while its catalytically-dead variant (dCas9) can be applied to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of malignant cells. As immunotherapy becomes increasingly prominent in cancer treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can engineer the immune cells to redirect them against cancer cells and potentiate antitumor immune responses. In this review, CRISPR strategies for the advancement of breast cancer diagnostics, modeling, and treatment are highlighted, culminating in a perspective on developing a precision medicine-based approach against breast cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Efficient nonviral oral gene delivery offers an attractive modality for chronic protein replacement therapy. Herein, the oral delivery of insulin gene is reported by a nonviral vector comprising a copolymer with a high degree of substitution of branched polyethylenimine on chitosan (CS-g-bPEI). Protecting the plasmid from gastric acidic degradation and facilitating transport across the gut epithelium, the CS-g-bPEI/insulin plasmid DNA nanoparticles (NPs) can achieve systemic transgene expression for days. A single dose of orally administered NPs (600 µg plasmid insulin (pINS)) to diabetic mice can protect the animals from hyperglycemia for more than 10 d. Three repeated administrations spaced over a 10 d interval produce similar glucose-lowering results with no hepatotoxicity detected. Positron-emission-tomography and computed-tomography images also confirm the glucose utilization by muscle cells. While this work suggests the feasibility of basal therapy for diabetes mellitus, its significance lies in the demonstration of a nonviral oral gene delivery system that can impact chronic protein replacement therapy and DNA vaccination.",

        "Abstract": "Burn, trauma, and various medical conditions including bacterial infection, diabetes complication, and surgery could lead to an acute cutaneous wound and scar formation. Application of tissue glues instead of sutures could minimize the additional trauma and scar formation. Despite the countless efforts devoted to the development of high-strength tissue glues, little attention has been paid to their influence on the scar formation. Here, we report the development of a new tissue glue with excellent biocompatibility and tunable degradability for scarless wound closure. A series of catechol-containing poly(amidoamine) (CPAA) polymers were synthesized via the one-step Michael addition of dopamine and bisacrylamide. The tertiary amino group in the polymer backbone was used to introduce a zwitterionic sulfobetaine group by one-step ring-opening polymerization. The introduction of the zwitterionic sulfobetaine group could easily tune the hydrophilicity and the degradability of CPAA without influencing the density of the catechol group in the polymer. Lap-shear tests on the porcine skin demonstrated a high adhesion strength of 7 kPa at 1 h, rising to 24 kPa by 12 h. Addition of silica nanoparticles could further enhance the adhesion strength by 50%. In vivo studies further confirmed that the CPAA tissue glue could effectively accelerate the healing process of incisional wounds on the back of Sprague Dawley rats compared with suture and reduce the scar formation.",

        "Abstract": "Controlled delivery of protein therapeutics remains a challenge. Here, the inclusion of diselenide-bond-containing organosilica moieties into the framework of silica to fabricate biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with oxidative and redox dual-responsiveness is reported. These diselenide-bridged MSNs can encapsulate cytotoxic RNase A into the 8-10 nm internal pores via electrostatic interaction and release the payload via a matrix-degradation controlled mechanism upon exposure to oxidative or redox conditions. After surface cloaking with cancer-cell-derived membrane fragments, these bioinspired RNase A-loaded MSNs exhibit homologous targeting and immune-invasion characteristics inherited from the source cancer cells. The efficient in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer performance, which includes increased blood circulation time and enhanced tumor accumulation along with low toxicity, suggests that these cell-membrane-coated, dual-responsive degradable MSNs represent a promising platform for the delivery of bio-macromolecules such as protein and nucleic acid therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Biological systems have developed an efficient multi-tiered defense system to block foreign substances such as engineered nanomaterials (NMs) from causing damage. In a pathological scenario, the disease itself may also pose additional barriers due to the imbalance between abnormal cells and their surrounding microenvironment, and NMs could behave similarly or differently to classic foreign substances, depending on their unique characteristics. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that govern the fate of NMs against these biological barriers, including the strategies that can be used to shift their fate between access and blockage, become key information for NMs design. In this manuscript, we first describe the biological barriers that NMs may encounter, and further discuss how these biological barrier interactions could shift the fate of NMs between toxicity and therapeutic potential. A list of effects that may influence NMs access at nano/bio interface are presented and discussed, followed by personal insights on the important nano/bio topics that require additional research for a better understanding of NM/biological barrier interactions.",

        "Abstract": "Effective and safe delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing elements remains a challenge. Here we report the development of PEGylated nanoparticles (named P-HNPs) based on the cationic α-helical polypeptide poly(γ-4-((2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)aminomethyl)benzyl-l-glutamate) for the delivery of Cas9 expression plasmid and sgRNA to various cell types and gene-editing scenarios. The cell-penetrating α-helical polypeptide enhanced cellular uptake and promoted escape of pCas9 and/or sgRNA from the endosome and transport into the nucleus. The colloidally stable P-HNPs achieved a Cas9 transfection efficiency up to 60% and sgRNA uptake efficiency of 67.4%, representing an improvement over existing polycation-based gene delivery systems. After performing single or multiplex gene editing with an efficiency up to 47.3% in vitro, we demonstrated that P-HNPs delivering Cas9 plasmid/sgRNA targeting the polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) gene achieved 35% gene deletion in HeLa tumor tissue to reduce the Plk1 protein level by 66.7%, thereby suppressing the tumor growth by >71% and prolonging the animal survival rate to 60% within 60 days. Capable of delivering Cas9 plasmids to various cell types to achieve multiplex gene knock-out, gene knock-in, and gene activation in vitro and in vivo, the P-HNP system offers a versatile gene-editing platform for biological research and therapeutic applications.",

We emphasize that continuous exploration of biomaterial technologies to engineer a more SMC-specific microenvironment will provide further insight on complex vascular diseases.",

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology can be used to edit single or multiple genes in a wide variety of cell types and organisms in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we review the rapidly developing CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies for disease modeling and gene correction and recent progress toward Cas9/guide RNA (gRNA) delivery based on viral and nonviral vectors. We discuss the relative merits of delivering the genome editing elements in the form of DNA, mRNA, or protein, and the opportunities of combining viral delivery of a transgene encoding Cas9 with nonviral delivery of gRNA. We highlight the lessons learned from nonviral gene delivery in the past three decades and consider their applicability for CRISPR/Cas9 delivery. We also include a discussion of bioinformatics tools for gRNA design and chemical modifications of gRNA. Finally, we consider the extracellular and intracellular barriers to nonviral CRISPR/Cas9 delivery and propose strategies that may overcome these barriers to realize the clinical potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing.",

        "Abstract": "Theranostics based on nanoparticles (NPs) is a promising paradigm in nanomedicine. Mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-based systems offer unique characteristics to enable multimodal imaging or simultaneous diagnosis and therapy. They include large surface area and volume, tunable pore size, functionalizable surface, and acceptable biological safety. Hybridization with other NPs and chemical modification can further potentiate the multifunctionality of MSN-based systems toward translation. Here, we update the recent progress on MSN-based systems for theranostic purposes. We discuss various synthetic approaches used to construct the theranostic platforms either via intrinsic chemistry or extrinsic combination. These include defect generation in the silica structure, encapsulation of diagnostic NPs within silica, their assembly on the silica surface, and direct conjugation of dye chemicals. Collectively, in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that multimodal imaging capacities can be integrated with the therapeutic functions of these MSN systems for therapy. With further improvement in bioimaging sensitivity and targeting specificity, the multifunctional MSN-based theranostic systems will find many clinical applications in the near future.",

        "Abstract": "Transdifferentiation has been described as a novel method for converting human fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells. Such an approach can produce differentiated cells to study physiology or pathophysiology, examine drug interactions or toxicities, and engineer cardiac tissues. Here we describe the transdifferentiation of human dermal fibroblasts towards the cardiac cell lineage via the induced expression of transcription factors GATA4, TBX5, MEF2C, MYOCD, NKX2-5, and delivery of microRNAs miR-1 and miR-133a. Cells undergoing transdifferentiation expressed ACTN2 and TNNT2 and partially organized their cytoskeleton in a cross-striated manner. The conversion process was associated with significant upregulation of a cohort of cardiac-specific genes, activation of pathways associated with muscle contraction and physiology, and downregulation of fibroblastic markers. We used a genetically encoded calcium indicator and readily detected active calcium transients although no spontaneous contractions were observed in transdifferentiated cells. Finally, we determined that inhibition of Janus kinase 1, inhibition of Glycogen synthase kinase 3, or addition of NRG1 significantly enhanced the efficiency of transdifferentiation. Overall, we describe a method for achieving transdifferentiation of human dermal fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells via transcription factor overexpression, microRNA delivery, and molecular pathway manipulation.",

        "Abstract": "Substrate nanotopography has been shown to be a potent modulator of cell phenotype and function. To dissect nanotopography modulation of cell behavior, a large area of nanopatterned substrate is desirable so that enough cells can be cultured on the nanotopography for subsequent biochemical and molecular biology analyses. However, current nanofabrication techniques have limitations to generate highly defined nanopatterns over a large area. Herein, we present a method to expand nanopatterned substrates from a small, highly defined nanopattern to a large area using stitch technique. The method combines multiple techniques, involving soft lithography to replicate poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) molds from a well-defined mold, stitch technique to assemble multiple PDMS molds to a single large mold, and nanoimprinting to generate a master mold on polystyrene (PS) substrates. With the PS master mold, we produce PDMS working substrates and demonstrate nanotopographical modulation of cell spreading. This method provides a simple, affordable yet versatile avenue to generate well-defined nanopatterns over large areas, and is potentially extended to create micro-/nanoscale devices with hybrid components.",

        "Abstract": "Regeneration of diseased tissue is one of the foremost concerns for millions of patients who suffer from tissue damage each year. Local delivery of cell-laden hydrogels offers an attractive approach for tissue repair. However, due to the typical macroscopic size of these cell constructs, the encapsulated cells often suffer from poor nutrient exchange. These issues can be mitigated by incorporating cells into microscopic hydrogels, or microgels, whose large surface-to-volume ratio promotes efficient mass transport and enhanced cell-matrix interactions. Using microfluidic technology, monodisperse cell-laden microgels with tunable sizes can be generated in a high-throughput manner, making them useful building blocks that can be assembled into tissue constructs with spatially controlled physicochemical properties. In this review, we examine microfluidics-generated cell-laden microgels for tissue regeneration applications. We provide a brief overview of the common biomaterials, gelation mechanisms, and microfluidic device designs that are used to generate these microgels, and summarize the most recent works on how they are applied to tissue regeneration. Finally, we discuss future applications of microfluidic cell-laden microgels as well as existing challenges that should be resolved to stimulate their clinical application.",

        "Abstract": "Translation of any inventions into products requires manufacturing. Development of drug/gene/cell delivery systems will eventually face manufacturing challenges, which require the establishment of standardized processes to produce biologically-relevant products of high quality without incurring prohibitive cost. Microfluidicu technologies present many advantages to improve the quality of drug/gene/cell delivery systems. They also offer the benefits of automation. What remains unclear is whether they can meet the scale-up requirement. In this perspective, we discuss the advantages of microfluidic-assisted synthesis of nanoscale drug/gene delivery systems, formation of microscale drug/cell-encapsulated particles, generation of genetically engineered cells and fabrication of macroscale drug/cell-loaded micro-/nano-fibers. We also highlight the scale-up challenges one would face in adopting microfluidic technologies for the manufacturing of these therapeutic delivery systems.",

        "Abstract": "The development of stable, functional microvessels remains an important obstacle to overcome for tissue engineered organs and treatment of ischemia. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a promising cell source for vascular tissue engineering as they are readily obtainable and carry the potential to differentiate towards all endothelial phenotypes. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of human umbilical cord blood-derived EPCs to form vessel-like structures within a tissue engineering scaffold material, a cell-adhesive and proteolytically degradable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel. EPCs in co-culture with angiogenic mural cells were encapsulated in hydrogel scaffolds by mixing with polymeric precursors and using a mild photocrosslinking process to form hydrogels with homogeneously dispersed cells. EPCs formed 3D microvessels networks that were stable for at least 30 days in culture, without the need for supplemental angiogenic growth factors. These 3D EPC microvessels displayed aspects of physiological microvasculature with lumen formation, expression of endothelial cell proteins (connexin 32, VE-cadherin, eNOS), basement membrane formation with collagen IV and laminin, perivascular investment of PDGFR-β and α-SMA positive cells, and EPC quiescence (<1% proliferating cells) by 2 weeks of co-culture. Our findings demonstrate the development of a novel, reductionist system that is well-defined and reproducible for studying progenitor cell-driven microvessel formation.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatocyte spheroids microencapsulated in hydrogels can contribute to liver research in various capacities. The conventional approach of microencapsulating spheroids produces a variable number of spheroids per microgel and requires an extra step of spheroid loading into the gel. Here, a microfluidics technology bypassing the step of spheroid loading and controlling the spheroid characteristics is reported. Double-emulsion droplets are used to generate microencapsulated homotypic or heterotypic hepatocyte spheroids (all as single spheroids <200 μm in diameter) with enhanced functions in 4 h. The composition of the microgel is tunable as demonstrated by improved hepatocyte functions during 24 d culture (albumin secretion, urea secretion, and cytochrome P450 activity) when alginate-collagen composite hydrogel is used instead of alginate. Hepatocyte spheroids in alginate-collagen also perform better than hepatocytes cultured in collagen-sandwich configuration. Moreover, hepatocyte functions are significantly enhanced when hepatocytes and endothelial progenitor cells (used as a novel supporting cell source) are co-cultured to form composite spheroids at an optimal ratio of 5:1, which could be further boosted when encapsulated in alginate-collagen. This microencapsulated-spheroid formation technology with high yield, versatility, and uniformity is envisioned to be an enabling technology for liver tissue engineering as well as biomanufacturing.",

        "Abstract": "For the successful treatment of severe wounds, angiogenesis must be induced to provide a sufficient blood supply to the wound site. There have been many studies on various structural and biochemical factors regulating angiogenesis, such as surface topography, surface modifications, angiogenic factors, and various cell types. However, there is a paucity of research on the effects of micro- and nanoscale topography and the application of pericytes in angiogenesis. In this study, we utilized nanoscale topography combined with a triculture system consisting of human pericytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. We investigated the effects of the nanografted substrata and a triculture system on proangiogenic therapies in vitro. Human dermal fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded with human pericytes from the placenta directly onto nanografted substrata composed of polydimethylsiloxane. We demonstrated that key elements of angiogenesis, including segment and capillary-like tubular structure formation, as well as the secretion of extracellular matrix, were increased by interaction between the nanografted substrata and the coculture containing pericytes. Thus, nanografted surfaces and triculture systems containing human pericytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells promote angiogenesis.",

Herein we report the direct conversion of human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to induced smooth muscle cells (iSMC) by induced expression of MYOCD. The EPC undergo a cytoskeletal rearrangement resembling that of mesenchymal cells within 3 days post initiation of MYOCD expression. By day 7, the reprogrammed cells show upregulation of smooth muscle markers ACTA2, MYH11, and TAGLN by qRT-PCR and ACTA2 and MYH11 expression by immunofluorescence. By two weeks, they resemble umbilical artery SMC in microarray gene expression analysis. The iSMC, in contrast to EPC control, show calcium transients in response to phenylephrine stimulation and a contractility an order of magnitude higher than that of EPC as determined by traction force microscopy. Tissue-engineered blood vessels constructed using iSMC show functionality with respect to flow- and drug-mediated vasodilation and vasoconstriction.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBV) can serve as vascular grafts and may also play an important role in the development of organs-on-a-chip. Most TEBV construction involves scaffolding with biomaterials such as collagen gel or electrospun fibrous mesh. Hypothesizing that a scaffold-free TEBV may be advantageous, we constructed a tubular structure (1 mm i.d.) from aligned human mesenchymal cell sheets (hMSC) as the wall and human endothelial progenitor cell (hEPC) coating as the lumen. The burst pressure of the scaffold-free TEBV was above 200 mmHg after three weeks of sequential culture in a rotating wall bioreactor and perfusion at 6.8 dynes/cm(2). The interwoven organization of the cell layers and extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) formation of the hMSC-based TEBV resembled that of native blood vessels. The TEBV exhibited flow-mediated vasodilation, vasoconstriction after exposure to 1 μM phenylephrine and released nitric oxide in a manner similar to that of porcine femoral vein. HL-60 cells attached to the TEBV lumen after TNF-α activation to suggest a functional endothelium. This study demonstrates the potential of a hEPC endothelialized hMSC-based TEBV for drug screening.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) directs post-transcriptional regulation of a network of genes by targeting mRNA. Although relatively recent in development, many miRNAs direct differentiation of various stem cells including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a major player in regenerative medicine. An effective and safe delivery of miRNA holds the key to translating miRNA technologies. Both viral and nonviral delivery systems have seen success in miRNA delivery, and each approach possesses advantages and disadvantages. A number of studies have demonstrated success in augmenting osteogenesis, improving cardiogenesis, and reducing fibrosis among many other tissue engineering applications. A scaffold-based approach with the possibility of local and sustained delivery of miRNA is particularly attractive since the physical cues provided by the scaffold may synergize with the biochemical cues induced by miRNA therapy. Herein, we first briefly cover the application of miRNA to direct stem cell fate via replacement and inhibition therapies, followed by the discussion of the promising viral and nonviral delivery systems. Next we present the unique advantages of a scaffold-based delivery in achieving lineage-specific differentiation and tissue development.",

        "Abstract": "Regenerative medicine has the potential to drastically change the field of health care from reactive to preventative and restorative. Exciting advances in stem cell biology and cellular reprogramming have fueled the progress of this field. Biochemical cues in the form of small molecule drugs, growth factors, zinc finger protein transcription factors and nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, monoclonal antibodies, plasmid DNA, aptamers, or RNA interference agents can play an important role to influence stem cell differentiation and the outcome of tissue regeneration. Many of these biochemical factors are fragile and must act intracellularly at the molecular level. They require an effective delivery system, which can take the form of a scaffold (e.g., hydrogels and electrospun fibers), carrier (viral and nonviral), nano- and microparticle, or genetically modified cell. In this review, we will discuss the history and current technologies of drug, protein, and gene delivery in the context of regenerative medicine. Next, we will present case examples of how delivery technologies are being applied to promote angiogenesis in nonhealing wounds or prevent angiogenesis in age related macular degeneration. Finally, we will conclude with a brief discussion of the regulatory pathway from bench to bedside for the clinical translation of these novel therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Researchers have applied mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to a variety of therapeutic scenarios by harnessing their multipotent, regenerative, and immunosuppressive properties with tropisms toward inflamed, hypoxic, and cancerous sites. Although MSC-based therapies have been shown to be safe and effective to a certain degree, the efficacy remains low in most cases when MSC are applied alone. To enhance their therapeutic efficacy, researchers have equipped MSC with targeted delivery functions using genetic engineering, therapeutic agent incorporation, and cell surface modification. MSC can be genetically modified virally or non-virally to overexpress therapeutic proteins that complement their innate properties. MSC can also be primed with non-peptidic drugs or magnetic nanoparticles for enhanced efficacy and externally regulated targeting, respectively. Furthermore, MSC can be functionalized with targeting moieties to augment their homing toward therapeutic sites using enzymatic modification, chemical conjugation, or non-covalent interactions. These engineering techniques are still works in progress, requiring optimization to improve the therapeutic efficacy and targeting effectiveness while minimizing any loss of MSC function. In this review, we will highlight the advanced techniques of engineering MSC, describe their promise and the challenges of translation into clinical settings, and suggest future perspectives on realizing their full potential for MSC-based therapy.",

Especially in oncology, aptamer nanomedicine may perform better than conventional or antibody-based chemotherapeutics due to specificity compared to the former and stability compared to the latter. Many proof-of-concept studies on applying aptamers to drug delivery, gene therapy, and cancer imaging have shown promising efficacy and impressive safety in vivo toward translation. Yet, there remains ample room for improvement and critical barriers to be addressed. In this review, we will first introduce the recent progress in clinical trials of aptamer nanomedicine, followed by a discussion of the barriers at the design and in vivo application stages. We will then highlight recent advances and engineering strategies proposed to tackle these barriers.

The aim of this research is to discover biocompatible materials and drugs that can promote cell migration in the wound area and thus enhance desirable wound healing effects. In this paper, we report that PDMS nanogratings could accelerate the migration of epithelial cells along the grating axis, and the addition of Imatinib could further increase the epithelial cell wound healing speed to 1.6 times the speed of control cells. We also demonstrate that this migration is mediated by lamellipodia protrusion, and is Rac1-GTPase activity dependent. Lastly, we discuss the potential application and prospect of different nanostructured biomaterials for wound healing studies.",

        "Abstract": "Transgene insertion plays an important role in gene therapy and in biological studies. Transposon-based systems that integrate transgenes by transposase-catalyzed \"cut-and-paste\" mechanism have emerged as an attractive system for transgenesis. Hyperactive piggyBac transposon is particularly promising due to its ability to integrate large transgenes with high efficiency. However, prolonged expression of transposase can become a potential source of genotoxic effects due to uncontrolled transposition of the integrated transgene from one chromosomal locus to another. In this study we propose a vector design to decrease post-transposition expression of transposase and to eliminate the cells that have residual transposase expression. We design a single plasmid construct that combines the transposase and the transpositioning transgene element to share a single polyA sequence for termination. Consequently, the separation of the transposase element from the polyA sequence after transposition leads to its deactivation. We also co-express Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) with the transposase. Therefore, cells having residual transposase expression can be eliminated by the administration of ganciclovir. We demonstrate the utility of this combination transposon system by integrating and expressing a model therapeutic gene, human coagulation Factor IX, in HEK293T cells.",

The objective of this study is to create a purely natural, uniform, and highly aligned nanofibrous ECM scaffold for potential tissue engineering applications. Synthetic nanogratings (130 nm in depth) were used to direct the growth of human dermal fibroblasts for up to 8 weeks, resulting in a uniform 70 μm-thick fibroblast cell sheet with highly aligned cells and ECM nanofibers. A natural ECM scaffold with uniformly aligned nanofibers of 78 ± 9 nm in diameter was generated after removing the cellular components from the detached fibroblast sheet. The elastic modulus of the scaffold was well maintained after the decellularization process because of the preservation of elastin fibers. Reseeding human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) showed the excellent capacity of the scaffold in directing and supporting cell alignment and proliferation along the underlying fibers.

Targeted activation of the endogenous Myod1 gene locus with this system led to stable and sustained reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into skeletal myocytes.

        "Abstract": "Use of mRNA-based vaccines for tumour immunotherapy has gained increasing attention in recent years. A growing number of studies applying nanomedicine concepts to mRNA tumour vaccination show that the mRNA delivered in nanoparticle format can generate a more robust immune response. Advances in the past decade have deepened our understanding of gene delivery barriers, mRNA's biological stability and immunological properties, and support the notion for engineering innovations tailored towards a more efficient mRNA nanoparticle vaccine delivery system. In this review we will first examine the suitability of mRNA for engineering manipulations, followed by discussion of a model framework that highlights the barriers to a robust anti-tumour immunity mediated by mRNA encapsulated in nanoparticles. Finally, by consolidating existing literature on mRNA nanoparticle tumour vaccination within the context of this framework, we aim to identify bottlenecks that can be addressed by future nanoengineering research.",

In this report, we demonstrate that tumor immunity can be achieved via nasal administration of mRNA. Mice nasally immunized with mRNA delivered in nanoparticle format demonstrate delayed tumor progression in both prophylactic and therapeutic immunization models. The observed tumor immunity correlates with splenic antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and is achieved only when mRNA is delivered in nanoparticle but not in naked format.

        "Abstract": "Co-delivery is a rapidly growing sector of drug delivery that aspires to enhance therapeutic efficacy through controlled delivery of diverse therapeutic cargoes with synergistic activities. It requires the design of carriers capable of simultaneously transporting to and releasing multiple therapeutics at a disease site. Co-delivery has arisen from the emerging trend of combination therapy, where treatment with two or more therapeutics at the same time can succeed where single therapeutics fail. However, conventional combination therapy offers little control over achieving an optimized therapeutic ratio at the target site. Co-delivery via inclusion of multiple therapeutic cargos within the same carrier addresses this issue by not only ensuring delivery of both therapeutics to the same cell, but also offering a platform for control of the delivery process, from loading to release. Co-delivery systems have been formulated using a number of carriers previously developed for single-therapeutic delivery. Liposomes, polymeric micelles, PLGA nanoparticles, and dendrimers have all been adapted for co-delivery. Much of the effort focuses on dealing with drugs having dissimilar properties, increasing loading efficiencies, and controlling loading and release ratios. In this review, we highlight the innovations in carrier designs and formulations to deliver combination cargoes of drug/drug, drug/siRNA, and drug/pDNA toward disease therapy. With rapid advances in mechanistic understanding of interrelating molecular pathways and development of molecular medicine, the future of co-delivery will become increasingly promising and prominent.",

        "Abstract": "Cellular reprogramming holds tremendous potential for cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Recently, fibroblasts have been directly converted into induced neurons (iNs) by overexpression of the neuronal transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1L. Hypothesizing that cell-topography interactions could influence the fibroblast-to-neuron reprogramming process, we investigated the effects of various topographies on iNs produced by direct reprogramming. Final iN purity and conversion efficiency were increased on micrograting substrates. Neurite branching was increased on microposts and decreased on microgratings, with a simplified dendritic arbor characterized by the reduction of MAP2(+) neurites. Neurite outgrowth increased significantly on various topographies. DNA microarray analysis detected 20 differentially expressed genes in iNs reprogrammed on smooth versus microgratings, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed the upregulation of Vip and downregulation of Thy1 and Bmp5 on microgratings. Electrophysiology and calcium imaging verified the functionality of these iNs. This study demonstrates the potential of applying topographical cues to optimize cellular reprogramming.",

        "Abstract": "Microemulsion represents an attractive platform for fundamental and applied biomedical research because the emulsified droplets can serve as millions of compartmentalized micrometer-sized reactors amenable to high-throughput screening or online monitoring. However, establishing stable emulsions with surfactants that are compatible with biological applications remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the lack of commercially available surfactants suitable for microemulsion-based biological assays, this study describes the facile synthesis of a biocompatible fluorosurfactant with nonionic tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl (Tris) polar head groups. We have further demonstrated compatibility of the developed surfactant with diverse emulsion-based applications, including DNA polymeric nanoparticle synthesis, enzymatic activity assay, and bacterial or mammalian cell culture, in the setup of both double- and multiphases of emulsions.",

        "Abstract": "An attractive option for tissue engineering is to use of multicellular spheroids as microtissues, particularly with stem cell spheroids. Conventional approaches of fabricating spheroids suffer from low throughput and polydispersity in size, and fail to supplement cues from extracellular matrix (ECM) for enhanced differentiation. In this study, we report the application of microfluidics-generated water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double-emulsion (DE) droplets as pico-liter sized bioreactor for rapid cell assembly and well-controlled microenvironment for spheroid culture. Cells aggregated to form size-controllable (30-80 μm) spheroids in DE droplets within 150 min and could be retrieved via a droplet-releasing agent. Moreover, precursor hydrogel solution can be adopted as the inner phase to produce spheroid-encapsulated microgels after spheroid formation. As an example, the encapsulation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) spheroids in alginate and alginate-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (-RGD) microgel was demonstrated, with enhanced osteogenic differentiation further exhibited in the latter case.",

        "Abstract": "As the designs of polymer systems used to deliver nucleic acids continue to evolve, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the basic bulk manufacturing techniques of the past will be insufficient to produce polymer-nucleic acid nanocomplexes that possess the uniformity, stability, and potency required for their successful clinical translation and widespread commercialization. Traditional bulk-prepared products are often physicochemically heterogeneous and may vary significantly from one batch to the next. Here we show that preparation of bioreducible nanocomplexes with an emulsion-based droplet microfluidic system produces significantly improved nanoparticles that are up to fifty percent smaller, more uniform, and are less prone to aggregation. The intracellular integrity of nanocomplexes prepared with this microfluidic method is significantly prolonged, as detected using a high-throughput flow cytometric quantum dot Förster resonance energy transfer nanosensor system. These physical attributes conspire to consistently enhance the delivery of both plasmid DNA and messenger RNA payloads in stem cells, primary cells, and human cell lines. Innovation in processing is necessary to move the field toward the broader clinical implementation of safe and effective nonviral nucleic acid therapeutics, and preparation with droplet microfluidics represents a step forward in addressing the critical barrier of robust and reproducible nanocomplex production.",

Herein, we demonstrate that gallium (Ga) doping can increase the band edge of SnO2, and we show that DSSCs using a Ga-doped SnO2 nano-cuboids based photoanode offer improved open circuit potential (~0.74 V), fill factor (~73.7%), and power conversion efficiency (~4.05%).",

        "Abstract": "Electrodeposited nanorods serving as multivalent bridges were fabricated and surface-decorated with ligands for immune cells. Gold and nickel solutions were sequentially electrodeposited on nanoporous anodized disc templates and the template was dissolved to retrieve bisegmented nanorods with different lengths. Gold and nickel segmented nanorods were surface-immobilized with mannose and RGD peptides to prepare immune-cell recruiting nanorods. Surface-functionalization of nanorods were confirmed by fluorescence-labeling of each ligands and confocal microscopy. Dendritic cells and T cells were co-incubated with the surface-functionalized nanorods, and the proximity between the nanorods and the immune cells was visualized by variable pressure scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. The long nanorods were associated with the immune cells, whereas the shorter nanorods were rather endocytosed by cells, suggesting a feasibility of the longer nanorods as bridging for the cells. Cytokine releases from the immune cells were monitored by cultivating lipopolysaccharide-activated dendritic cells with T cells. Interleukine-2 and interferon-γ release profiles showed a strong correlation with the length of the nanorod, where the 4 μm nanorods induced the highest levels of cytokine release compared to 1 or 2 μm nanorods. Thus, we concluded that the proximity of the immune cells increased by bridging the immune cells with the nanobridging system, which subsequently increased cytokine release by facilitating the antigen presentation process.",

        "Title": "Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors differentiate to cardiomyocytes and form biosynthetic tissues.",
        "Abstract": "The mammalian heart has little capacity to regenerate, and following injury the myocardium is replaced by non-contractile scar tissue. Consequently, increased wall stress and workload on the remaining myocardium leads to chamber dilation, dysfunction, and heart failure. Cell-based therapy with an autologous, epigenetically reprogrammed, and cardiac-committed progenitor cell source could potentially reverse this process by replacing the damaged myocardium with functional tissue. However, it is unclear whether cardiac progenitor cell-derived cardiomyocytes are capable of attaining levels of structural and functional maturity comparable to that of terminally-fated cardiomyocytes. Here, we first describe the derivation of mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which once differentiated allow for the enrichment of Nkx2-5(+) cardiac progenitors, and the cardiomyocyte-specific expression of the red fluorescent protein. We show that the cardiac progenitors are multipotent and capable of differentiating into endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. Moreover, cardiac progenitor selection corresponds to cKit(+) cell enrichment, while cardiomyocyte cell-lineage commitment is concomitant with dual expression of either cKit/Flk1 or cKit/Sca-1. We proceed to show that the cardiac progenitor-derived cardiomyocytes are capable of forming electrically and mechanically coupled large-scale 2D cell cultures with mature electrophysiological properties. Finally, we examine the cell progenitors' ability to form electromechanically coherent macroscopic tissues, using a physiologically relevant 3D culture model and demonstrate that following long-term culture the cardiomyocytes align, and form robust electromechanical connections throughout the volume of the biosynthetic tissue construct. We conclude that the iPS cell-derived cardiac progenitors are a robust cell source for tissue engineering applications and a 3D culture platform for pharmacological screening and drug development studies.",

In this study, we design an excisable loxP-flanked lentiviral construct that a) includes all the reprogramming elements in a single lentiviral vector expressed by a strong EF-1α promoter; b) enables easy determination of lentiviral titer; c) enables transgene removal and cell enrichment using LoxP-site-specific Cre-recombinase excision and Herpes Simplex Virus-thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/gan) negative selection; and d) allows for transgene excision in a colony format. A reprogramming efficiency comparable to that reported in the literature without boosting molecules can be consistently obtained. To further demonstrate the utility of this Cre-loxP/HSV-tk/gan strategy, we incorporate a non-viral therapeutic transgene (human blood coagulation Factor IX) in the iPSCs, whose expression can be controlled by a temporal pulse of Cre recombinase. The robustness of this platform enables the implementation of an efficacious and cost-effective protocol for iPSC generation and their subsequent transgenesis for downstream studies.",

        "Abstract": "Transient overexpression of defined combinations of master regulator genes can effectively induce cellular reprogramming: the acquisition of an alternative predicted phenotype from a differentiated cell lineage. This can be of particular importance in cardiac regenerative medicine wherein the heart lacks the capacity to heal itself, but simultaneously contains a large pool of fibroblasts. In this study we determined the cardio-inducing capacity of ten transcription factors to actuate cellular reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells. Overexpression of transcription factors MYOCD and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp1 and SMARCD3 enhanced the basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported GATA4, TBX5, and MEF2C. In particular, combinations of five or seven transcription factors enhanced the activation of cardiac reporter vectors, and induced an upregulation of cardiac-specific genes. Global gene expression analysis also demonstrated a significantly greater cardio-inducing effect when the transcription factors MYOCD and SRF were used. Detection of cross-striated cells was highly dependent on the cell culture conditions and was enhanced by the addition of valproic acid and JAK inhibitor. Although we detected Ca(2+) transient oscillations in the reprogrammed cells, we did not detect significant changes in resting membrane potential or spontaneously contracting cells. This study further elucidates the cardio-inducing effect of the transcriptional networks involved in cardiac cellular reprogramming, contributing to the ongoing rational design of a robust protocol required for cardiac regenerative therapies.",

        "Abstract": "High throughput cellular studies require small sample volume to reduce costs and enhance sensitivity. Microfluidics-generated water-in-oil (W/O) single emulsion droplet systems, in particular, provide uniform, well defined and discrete microenvironment for cell culture, screening, and sorting. However, these single emulsion droplets are incapable of continuous supply of nutrient molecule and are not compatible with aqueous phase-based analysis. A solution is to entrap W/O droplets in another aqueous phase, forming water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsions. The external aqueous phase efficiently prevents desiccation and reduces the amount of organic component, and yet retaining the advantages of compartmentalization. The internal environment can also be programmed dynamically without the need of rupturing the droplets. In this study, we explore the potential application of W/O/W double emulsion droplets for cell cultivation, genetic activation and study of more complicated biological events such as bacteria quorum-sensing as an example. This study demonstrates the advantages and potential application of double emulsion for the study of complex biological processes.",

        "Abstract": "Oral delivery is an attractive route to deliver therapeutics via nanoparticles due to its ease of administration and patient compliance. This review discusses laboratory techniques for studying oral delivery of nanoparticles, which offer protection of cargo through the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the difficulties in modeling oral delivery include the harsh acidic environment, variable pH, and the tight monolayer of endothelial cells present throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The use of in vitro techniques including the Transwell ® system, simulated gastric/intestinal fluid, and diffusion chambers addresses these challenges. When studying effects after oral delivery in vivo, bioimaging of nanoparticle biodistribution using radioactive markers has been popular. Functional assays such as immune response and systemic protein concentration analysis can further define the merits of the oral delivery systems. As biologics become increasingly more important in chronic therapies, nanoparticle-mediated oral delivery will assume greater prominence, and more sophisticated in vitro and in vivo models will be required.",

        "Abstract": "Transdifferentiation, where differentiated cells are reprogrammed into another lineage without going through an intermediate proliferative stem cell-like stage, is the next frontier of regenerative medicine. Wernig et al. first described the direct conversion of fibroblasts into functional induced neuronal cells (iNs). Subsequent reports of transdifferentiation into clinically relevant neuronal subtypes have further endorsed the prospect of autologous cell therapy for neurodegenerative disorders. So far, all published neuronal transdifferentiation protocols rely on lentiviruses, which likely precludes their clinical translation. Instead, we delivered plasmids encoding neuronal transcription factors (Brn2, Ascl1, Myt1l) to primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a bioreducible linear poly(amido amine). The low toxicity and high transfection efficiency of this gene carrier allowed repeated dosing to sustain high transgene expression levels. Serial 0.5 µg cm(-2) doses of reprogramming factors delivered at 48-hour intervals produced up to 7.6% Tuj1(+) (neuron-specific class III β-tubulin) cells, a subset of which expressed MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2), tau, and synaptophysin. A synapsin-red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter helped to identify more mature, electrophysiologically active cells, with 24/26 patch-clamped RFP(+) cells firing action potentials. Some non-virally induced neuronal cells (NiNs) were observed firing multiple and spontaneous action potentials. This study demonstrates the feasibility of nonviral neuronal transdifferentiation, and may be amenable to other transdifferentiation processes.",

In this study, we evaluated transfection efficiencies of mRNA delivered in naked and nanoparticle format in vitro and in vivo using GFP and luciferase as reporters. While mRNA nanoparticles transfect primary human and mouse dendritic cells (DCs) efficiently in vitro, naked mRNA could not produce any detectable gene product. The protein expression of nanoparticle-mediated transfection in vitro peaks rapidly within 5-7h and decays in a biphasic manner. In vivo, naked mRNA is more efficient than mRNA nanoparticles when administered subcutaneously. In contrast, mRNA nanoparticle performs better when administered intranasally and intravenously. Gene expression is most transient when delivered intravenously in nanoparticle format with an apparent half-life of 1.4h and lasts less than 24h, and most sustained when delivered in the naked format subcutaneously at the base of tail with an apparent half-life of 18h and persists for at least 6days. Notably, exponential decreases in protein expression are consistently observed post-delivery of mRNA in vivo regardless of the mode of delivery (naked or nanoparticle) or the site of administration. This study elucidates the performance of mRNA transfection and suggests a niche for mRNA therapeutics when predictable in vivo transgene expression kinetics is imperative.",

Human umbilical cord blood-derived ECs (hCB-ECs) were grown in coculture with human aortic SMCs in either a mixed or lamellar spatial geometry and analyzed over a culture period of 12 days. The hCB-ECs cultured on SMCs in a mixed system had higher cell speeds, shorter persistence times, and lower random motility coefficients than ECs in a lamellar system. By day 12 of coculture, mixed systems demonstrated greater anastomoses and capillary loop formation than lamellar systems as evidenced by a higher number of branch points, angle of curvature between branch points, and percentage of imaged area covered by networks. The network morphology was more uniform in the mixed systems than the lamellar systems with fewer EC clusters present after several days in culture. Proliferation of hCB-ECs was higher for mixed cocultures during the first 24 h of coculture, and then declined dramatically suggesting that proliferation only contributed to network formation during the early stages of coculture. Proteome assay results show reduced solution levels, but no change in intracellular levels of angiogenic proteins in lamellar systems compared to mixed systems. These data suggest that mixing ECs and SMCs together favors the formation of EC networks to a greater extent than a lamellar arrangement in which ECs form a cell layer above a confluent, quiescent layer of SMCs.",

It relies on the precise organization of nanomaterials to achieve unique functionality. There are no interactions more elegant than those governing nucleic acids via Watson-Crick base-pairing rules. The infinite combinations of DNA/RNA base pairs and their remarkable molecular recognition capability can give rise to interesting nanostructures that are only limited by our imagination. Over the past years, creative assembly of nucleic acids has fashioned a plethora of two-dimensional and three-dimensional nanostructures with precisely controlled size, shape and spatial functionalization. These nanostructures have been precisely patterned with molecules, proteins and gold nanoparticles for the observation of chemical reactions at the single molecule level, activation of enzymatic cascade and novel modality of photonic detection, respectively. Recently, they have also been engineered to encapsulate and release bioactive agents in a stimulus-responsive manner for therapeutic applications. The future of nucleic acid-based nanoengineering is bright and exciting. In this review, we will discuss the strategies to control the assembly of nucleic acids and highlight the recent efforts to build functional nucleic acid nanodevices for nanomedicine.",

        "Abstract": "Polymeric substrates intended for cell culture and tissue engineering are often surface-modified to facilitate cell attachment of most anchorage-dependent cell types. The modification alters the surface chemistry and possibly topography. However, scant attention has been paid to other surface property alterations. In studying oxygen plasma treatment of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), we show that oxygen plasma treatment alters the surface chemistry and, consequently, the topography and elasticity of PDMS at the nanoscale level. The elasticity factor has the predominant effect, compared with the chemical and topographical factors, on cell adhesions of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The enhanced focal adhesions favor cell spreading and osteogenesis of hMSCs. Given the prevalent use of PDMS in biomedical device construction and cell culture experiments, this study highlights the importance of understanding how oxygen plasma treatment would impact subsequent cell-substrate interactions. It helps explain inconsistency in the literature and guides preparation of PDMS-based biomedical devices in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Antibodies to DNA (anti-DNA) are the serological hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and can mediate disease pathogenesis by the formation of immune complexes. Since blocking immune complex formation can attenuate disease manifestations, the effects of nucleic acid binding polymers (NABPs) on anti-DNA binding in vitro were investigated. The compounds tested included polyamidoamine dendrimer, 1,4-diaminobutane core, generation 3.0 (PAMAM-G3), hexadimethrine bromide, and a β-cylodextrin-containing polycation. As shown with plasma from patients with SLE, NABPs can inhibit anti-DNA antibody binding in ELISA assays. The inhibition was specific since the NABPs did not affect binding to tetanus toxoid or the Sm protein, another lupus autoantigen. Furthermore, the polymers could displace antibody from preformed complexes. Together, these results indicate that NABPs can inhibit the formation of immune complexes and may represent a new approach to treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Stem cells possess unique abilities as they can renew themselves for extended periods of time and have the capacity to differentiate into a variety of lineages. They hold promise for treating a plethora of diseases ranging from musculoskeletal defects to myocardial infarction and to neural disorders. Understanding how to control the fate decision of these cells to self-renew or differentiate is paramount in stem cell tissue engineering. Recently, significant progress has been made in guiding stem cell differentiation in vitro, and we are beginning to understand the complex interplay of factors that control their fate. Here, we highlight the recent approaches for guidance of stem cells through patterning of surfaces at the micro- and nanoscale. Particular attention is given to chemical patterning of substrates with adhesion ligands and physical patterning with a variety of topographical features. These surface-mediated biochemical and mechanical cues have proven influential in altering a wide range of stem cell phenotypes. This approach to guide or ultimately control stem cells by surface patterning has enormous potential implications in cell therapies and regenerative medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Nanotopography changes human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) from their shape to their differentiation potential; however little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we study the culture of hMSC on polydimethylsiloxane substrates with 350 nm grating topography and investigate the focal adhesion composition and dynamics using biochemical and imaging techniques. Our results show that zyxin protein plays a key role in the hMSC response to nanotopography. Zyxin expression is downregulated on 350 nm gratings, leading to smaller and more dynamic focal adhesion. Since the association of zyxin with focal adhesions is force-dependent, smaller zyxin-positive adhesion as well as its higher turnover rate suggests that the traction force in focal adhesion on 350 nm topography is decreased. These changes lead to faster and more directional migration on 350 nm gratings. These findings demonstrate that nanotopography decreases the mechanical forces acting on focal adhesions in hMSC and suggest that force-dependent changes in zyxin protein expression and kinetics underlie the focal adhesion remodeling in response to 350 nm grating topography, resulting in modulation of hMSC function.",

        "Abstract": "Nonviral delivery of nucleic acids is a potentially safe and viable therapeutic modality for inherited and acquired diseases. However, current systems have proven too inefficient for widespread clinical translation. The rational design of improved carriers depends on a quantitative, mechanistic understanding of the rate-limiting barriers to efficient intracellular delivery. Separation of the nucleic acid from the carrier is one of the barriers, which may be analyzed by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), a mechanism used to detect interactions between fluorescently labeled molecules. When applied to the molecular components of polymer or lipid-based nanocomplexes, FRET provides information on their complexation status, uptake, release and degradation. Recently, the design of FRET systems incorporating quantum dots as energy donors has led to improved signal stability, allowing prolonged measurements, as well as increased sensitivity, enabling direct detection and the potential for multiplexing. The union of quantum dots and FRET is providing new insights into the mechanisms of nonviral nucleic acid delivery through convergent characterization of delivery barriers, and has the potential to accelerate the design of improved carriers to realize the potential of nucleic acid therapeutics and gene medicine.",

        "Title": "Comparative study of nanoparticle-mediated transfection in different GI epithelium co-culture models.",
        "Abstract": "Oral nonviral gene delivery is the most attractive and arguably the most challenging route of administration. To identify a suitable carrier, we studied the transport of different classes (natural polymer, synthetic polymer and synthetic lipid-polymer) of DNA nanoparticles through three well-characterized cellular models of intestinal epithelium (Caco2, Caco2-HT29MTX and Caco2-Raji). Poly(phosphoramidate-dipropylamine) (PPA) and Lipid-Protamine-DNA (LPD) nanoparticles consistently showed the highest level of human insulin mRNA expression and luciferase protein expression in these models, typically at least three orders of magnitude above background. All of the nanoparticles increased tight junction permeability, with PPA and PEI having the most dramatic transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) decreases of (35.3±8.5%) and (37.5±1.5%) respectively in the first hour. The magnitude of TEER decrease correlated with nanoparticle surface charge, implicating electrostatic interactions with the tight junction proteins. However, confocal microscopy revealed that the nanoparticles were mostly uptaken by the enterocytes. Quantitative uptake and transport experiments showed that the endocytosed, quantum dot (QD)-labeled PPA-DNA nanoparticles remained in the intestinal cells even after 24h. Negligible amount of quantum dot labeled DNA was detected in the basolateral chamber, with the exception of the Caco2-Raji co-cultures, which internalized nanoparticles 2 to 3 times more readily compared to Caco2 and Caco2-HT29MTX cultures. PEGylation decreased the transfection efficacy by at least an order of magnitude, lowered the magnitude of TEER decrease and halved the uptake of PPA-DNA nanoparticles. A key finding was insulin mRNA being detected in the underlying HepG2 cells, signifying that some of the plasmid was transported across the intestinal epithelial layer while retaining at least partial bioactivity. However, the inefficient transport suggests that transcytosis alone would not engender a significant therapeutic effect, and this transport modality must be augmented by other means in vivo to render nonviral oral gene delivery practical.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in pluripotent stem cell research have provided investigators with potent sources of cardiogenic cells. However, tissue engineering methodologies to assemble cardiac progenitors into aligned, 3-dimensional (3D) myocardial tissues capable of physiologically relevant electrical conduction and force generation are lacking. In this study, we introduced 3D cell alignment cues in a fibrin-based hydrogel matrix to engineer highly functional cardiac tissues from genetically purified mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiovascular progenitors (CVPs). Procedures for CM and CVP derivation, purification, and functional differentiation in monolayer cultures were first optimized to yield robust intercellular coupling and maximize velocity of action potential propagation. A versatile soft-lithography technique was then applied to reproducibly fabricate engineered cardiac tissues with controllable size and 3D architecture. While purified CMs assembled into a functional 3D syncytium only when supplemented with supporting non-myocytes, purified CVPs differentiated into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells, and autonomously supported the formation of functional cardiac tissues. After a total culture time similar to period of mouse embryonic development (21 days), the engineered cardiac tissues exhibited unprecedented levels of 3D organization and functional differentiation characteristic of native neonatal myocardium, including: 1) dense, uniformly aligned, highly differentiated and electromechanically coupled cardiomyocytes, 2) rapid action potential conduction with velocities between 22 and 25 cm/s, and 3) significant contractile forces of up to 2 mN. These results represent an important advancement in stem cell-based cardiac tissue engineering and provide the foundation for exploiting the exciting progress in pluripotent stem cell research in the future tissue engineering therapies for heart disease.",

        "Abstract": "As a prelude to the understanding of mechanotransduction in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation, the mechanical behavior of hESCs in the form of cell pellet is studied. The pellets were tested after 3 or 5 weeks of cell culture in order to demonstrate the effect of the duration of cell culture on the mechanical properties of the pellets. A micromechanical tester was used to conduct unconfined compression on hESC pellet, and experimental, numerical, and analytical methods were combined to determine the mechanical properties of hESC pellet. It is assumed that the mechanical behavior of hESC pellets can be described by an isotropic, linear viscoelastic model consisting of a spring and two Maxwell units in parallel, and the Poisson's ratio of the hESC pellet is constant based on pellet deformation in the direction perpendicular to the compression direction. Finite element method (FEM) simulation was adopted to determine the values of Poisson's ratio and the five parameters contained in the viscoelastic model. The variations of Poisson's ratio and the initial elastic modulus are found to be larger compared with those of the four other parameters. Results show that longer duration of cell culture leads to higher modulus of hESC pellet. The effect of pellet size error on the values of mechanical parameters determined is studied using FEM simulation, and it is found that the effect of size error on Poisson's ratio and initial elastic modulus is much larger than that on the other parameters.",

Analysed with a fractal dimension formalism, we observed significant structural changes in differentiating human mesenchymal stem cells within one day after induction, earlier than could be detected by gene expression profiling. Moreover, light scattering microscopy is entirely non-perturbative, so the same sample could be monitored throughout the differentiation process. We explored one possible mechanism, chromatin remodelling, to account for the changes we observed. Correlating with the staining of HP1α, a heterochromatin protein, we applied novel microscopy methods and fractal analysis to monitor the plastic dynamics of chromatin within stem cell nuclei. We showed that the level of chromatin condensation changed during differentiation, and provide one possible explanation for the changes seen with the light scattering method. These results lend physical insight into stem cell differentiation while providing physics-based methods for non-invasive detection of the differentiation process.",

While significant effort has concentrated on developing nanocarriers to improve the delivery aspects, scant attention has been paid to the synthetic process of poorly controlled nanocomplex formation. Proposed here is a reliable system to better control the complexation process, and thus the physical properties of the nanocomplexes, through microfluidics-assisted confinement (MAC) in picoliter droplets. We show that these homogeneous MAC-synthesized nanocomplexes exhibit narrower size distribution, lower cytotoxicity, and higher transfection efficiency compared to their bulk-synthesized counterparts. MAC represents a physical approach to control the energetic self-assembly of polyelectrolytes, thereby complementing the chemical innovations in nanocarrier design to optimize nucleic acid and peptide delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Cells residing in a microenvironment interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and neighboring cells. The ECM built from biomacromolecules often includes nanotopography. Through the ECM, interstitial flows facilitate transport of nutrients and play an important role in tissue maintenance and pathobiology. To create a microenvironment that can incorporate both nanotopography and flow for studies of cell-matrix interactions, we fabricated microfluidic channels endowed with nanopatterns suitable for dynamic culture. Using polymer thin film technology, we developed a versatile stitching technique to generate a large area of nanopatterned surface and a simple microtransfer assembly technique to assemble polydimethylsiloxane-based microfluidics. The cellular study showed that both nanotopography and fluid shear stress played a significant role in adhesion, spreading, and migration of human mesenchymal stem cells. The orientation and deformation of cytoskeleton and nuclei were regulated through the interplay of these two cues. The nanostructured microfluidic platform provides a useful tool to promote the fundamental understanding of cell-matrix interactions and may be used to regulate the fate of stem cells.",

        "Abstract": "Significant effort continues to be exerted toward the improvement of transfection mediated by nonviral vectors. These endeavors are often focused on the design of particulate carriers with properties that encourage efficient accumulation at the membrane surface, particle uptake, and endosomal escape. Despite its demonstrated importance in successful nonviral transfection, relatively little investigation has been done to understand the pressures driving internalized vectors into favorable nondegradative endocytic pathways. Improvements in transfection efficiency have been noted for complexes delivered with a substrate-mediated approach, but the reasons behind such enhancements remain unclear. The phenotypic changes exhibited by cells interacting with nano- and micro-featured substrates offer hints that may explain these effects. This review describes nanoscale particulate and substrate parameters that influence both the uptake of nonviral gene carriers and the endocytic phenotype of interacting cells, and explores the molecular links that may mediate these interactions. Substrate-mediated control of endocytosis represents an exciting new design parameter that will guide the creation of efficient transgene carriers.",

        "Abstract": "Optimization of nonviral gene delivery typically focuses on the design of particulate carriers that are endowed with desirable membrane targeting, internalization, and endosomal escape properties. Topographical control of cell transfectability, however, remains a largely unexplored parameter. Emerging literature has highlighted the influence of cell-topography interactions on modulation of many cell phenotypes, including protein expression and cytoskeletal behaviors implicated in endocytosis. Using high-throughput screening of primary human dermal fibroblasts cultured on a combinatorial library of microscale topographies, we have demonstrated an improvement in nonviral transfection efficiency for cells cultured on dense micropit patterns compared to smooth substrates, as verified with flow cytometry. A 25% increase in GFP(+) cells was observed independent of proliferation rate, accompanied by SEM and confocal microscopy characterization to help explain the phenomenon qualitatively. This finding encourages researchers to investigate substrate topography as a new design consideration for the optimization of nonviral transfection systems.",

        "Abstract": "Cells sense cues in their surrounding microenvironment. These cues are converted into intracellular signals and transduced to the nucleus in order for the cell to respond and adapt its function. Within the nucleus, structural changes occur that ultimately lead to changes in the gene expression. In this study, we explore the structural changes of the nucleus of human mesenchymal stem cells as an effect of topographical cues. We use a controlled nanotopography to drive shape changes to the cell nucleus, and measure the changes with both fluorescence microscopy and a novel light scattering technique. The nucleus changes shape dramatically in response to the nanotopography, and in a manner dependent on the mechanical properties of the substrate. The kinetics of the nuclear deformation follows an unexpected trajectory. As opposed to a gradual shape change in response to the topography, once the cytoskeleton attains an aligned and elongation morphology on the time scale of several hours, the nucleus changes shape rapidly and intensely.",

        "Abstract": "In this report, we have demonstrated that by temporarily removing Kupffer cells (KCs), the transgene expression levels mediated by retrograde intrabiliary infusion (RII) of plasmid DNA, polyethylenimine-DNA, and chitosan nanoparticles were enhanced by 1,927-, 131-, and 23,450-fold, respectively, in comparison with the respective groups without KC removal. KC removal also led to significantly prolonged transgene expression in the liver that received all three carriers. This increased transgene expression was correlated with significantly reduced serum tumor necrosis factor-α level as an indicator for KC activation. These results suggest that KC activation is a significant contributing factor to the lowered transgene expression by polycation-DNA nanoparticles delivered by RII. More importantly, the combination of RII and transient removal of KCs may be adopted as an effective approach to achieving high and persistent transgene expression in the liver mediated by nonviral nanoparticles.",

In this study, we demonstrate the sustained treatment of hemophilia through a non-viral, tissue engineering approach facilitated by growth factor-releasing co-axial electrospun fibers. FVIII-producing skeletal myotubes were first engineered on aligned electrospun fibers in vitro, followed by implantation in hemophilic mice with or without a layer of core-shell electrospun fibers designed to provide sustained delivery of angiogenic or lymphangiogenic growth factors, which serves to stimulate the lymphatic or vascular systems to enhance the FVIII transport from the implant site into systemic circulation. Upon subcutaneous implantation into hemophilic mice, the construct seamlessly integrated with the host tissue within one month, and specifically induced either vascular or lymphatic network infiltration in accordance with the growth factors released from the electrospun fibers. Engineered constructs that induced angiogenesis resulted in sustained elevation of plasma FVIII and significantly reduced blood coagulation time for at least 2-months. Biomaterials-assisted functional tissue engineering was shown in this study to offer protein replacement therapy for a genetic disorder such as hemophilia.",

The extracellular matrix or substratum with which cells interact often includes topography at the nanoscale. For example, the basement membrane of many tissues displays features of pores, fibers and ridges in the nanometer range. The nanoscale topography has significant effects on cellular behavior. Knowledge of the cell-substratum interactions is crucial to the understanding of many fundamental biological questions and to regenerative medicine. Rapid advances in nanotechnology enable cellular study on engineered nanoscale surfaces. Recent findings underscore the phenomenon that mammalian cells do respond to nanosized features on a synthetic surface. This review covers the commonly used techniques of engineering nanoscale surface and the techniques which have not been adapted but are of great potential in regenerative medicine, surveys the applications of nanoscale surface in regenerative medicine including vascular, bone, neural and stem cell tissue engineering, and discusses the possible mechanisms of cellular responses to nanoscale surface.

Hypothesizing that topographical cue and a physiologically relevant low-oxygen condition could promote the formation of such an hMSC layer, we studied the culture of hMSCs on synthetic nanogratings (350 nm width and 700 nm pitch) and either under 2 or 20% O(2). Culturing hMSCs on the nanogratings highly aligned the cells, but it tended to create patchy layers and accentuate the hMSC differentiation. The 2% O(2) improved the alignment and uniformity of hMSCs, and reduced their differentiation. Over a 14-day culture period, hMSCs in 2% O(2) showed uniform connexon distribution, secreted abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and displayed a high progenicity. After 21-day culture on nanogratings, hMSCs exposed to 2% O(2) maintained a higher viability and differentiation capacity. This study established that a 2% O(2) culture condition could restrict the differentiation of hMSCs cultured on nanopatterns, thereby setting the foundation to fabricate a uniformly aligned hMSC sheet for different regenerative medicine applications.",

The rational design of more efficient nonviral gene carriers will be possible only with better mechanistic understanding of the critical rate-limiting steps, such as nanocomplex unpacking to release DNA and degradation by nucleases. We present a two-step quantum dot fluorescence resonance energy transfer (two-step QD-FRET) approach to simultaneously and non-invasively analyze DNA condensation and stability. Plasmid DNA, double-labeled with QD (525 nm emission) and nucleic acid dyes, were complexed with Cy5-labeled cationic gene carriers. The QD donor drives energy transfer stepwise through the intermediate nucleic acid dye to the final acceptor Cy5. At least three distinct states of DNA condensation and integrity were distinguished in single particle manner and within cells by quantitative ratiometric analysis of energy transfer efficiencies. This novel two-step QD-FRET method allows for more detailed assessment of the onset of DNA release and degradation simultaneously.",

        "Abstract": "Current strategies to limit macrophage adhesion, fusion and fibrous capsule formation in the foreign body response have focused on modulating material surface properties. We hypothesize that topography close to biological scale, in the micron and nanometric range, provides a passive approach without bioactive agents to modulate macrophage behavior. In our study, topography-induced changes in macrophage behavior was examined using parallel gratings (250 nm-2 mum line width) imprinted on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS). RAW 264.7 cell adhesion and elongation occurred maximally on 500 nm gratings compared to planar controls over 48 h. TNF-alpha and VEGF secretion levels by RAW 264.7 cells showed greatest sensitivity to topographical effects, with reduced levels observed on larger grating sizes at 48 h. In vivo studies at 21 days showed reduced macrophage adhesion density and degree of high cell fusion on 2 mum gratings compared to planar controls. It was concluded that topography affects macrophage behavior in the foreign body response on all polymer surfaces examined. Topography-induced changes, independent of surface chemistry, did not reveal distinctive patterns but do affect cell morphology and cytokine secretion in vitro, and cell adhesion in vivo particularly on larger size topography compared to planar controls.",

        "Title": "Transport of chitosan-DNA nanoparticles in human intestinal M-cell model versus normal intestinal enterocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Oral vaccination is one of the most promising applications of polymeric nanoparticles. Using two different in vitro cellular models to partially reproduce the characteristics of intestinal enterocytes and M-cells, this study demonstrates that nanoparticle transport through the M-cell co-culture model is 5-fold that of the intestinal epithelial monolayer, with at least 80% of the chitosan-DNA nanoparticles uptaken in the first 30 min. Among the properties of nanoparticles studied, ligand decoration has the most dramatic effect on the transcytosis rate: transferrin modification enhances transport through both models by 3- to 5-fold. The stability of the nanoparticles also affects transport kinetics. Factors which de-stabilize the nanoparticles, such as low charge (N/P) ratio and addition of serum, result in aggregation and in turn decreases transport efficiency. Of these stability factors, luminal pH is of great interest as an increase in pH from 5.5 to 6.4 and 7.4 leads to a 3- and 10-fold drop in nanoparticle transport, respectively. Since soluble chitosan can act as an enhancer to increase paracellular transport by up to 60%, this decrease is partially attributed to the soluble chitosan precipitating near neutral pH. The implication that chitosan-DNA nanoparticles are more stable in the upper regions of the small intestine suggests that higher uptake rates may occur in the duodenum compared to the ileum and the colon.",

        "Abstract": "The growth of stem cells can be modulated by physical factors such as extracellular matrix nanotopography. We hypothesize that nanotopography modulates cell behavior by changing the integrin clustering and focal adhesion (FA) assembly, leading to changes in cytoskeletal organization and cell mechanical properties. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured on 350 nm gratings of tissue-culture polystyrene (TCPS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) showed decreased expression of integrin subunits alpha2, alpha , alpha V, beta2, beta 3 and beta 4 compared to the unpatterned controls. On gratings, the elongated hMSCs exhibited an aligned actin cytoskeleton, while on unpatterned controls, spreading cells showed a random but denser actin cytoskeleton network. Expression of cytoskeleton and FA components was also altered by the nanotopography as reflected in the mechanical properties measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation. On the rigid TCPS, hMSCs on gratings exhibited lower instantaneous and equilibrium Young's moduli and apparent viscosity. On the softer PDMS, the effects of nanotopography were not significant. However, hMSCs cultured on PDMS showed lower cell mechanical properties than those on TCPS, regardless of topography. These suggest that both nanotopography and substrate stiffness could be important in determining mechanical properties, while nanotopography may be more dominant in determining the organization of the cytoskeleton and FAs.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue engineering may provide an alternative to cell injection as a therapeutic solution for myocardial infarction. A tissue-engineered muscle patch may offer better host integration and higher functional performance. This study examined the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts on aligned electrospun polyurethane (PU) fibers and in the presence of electromechanical stimulation. Skeletal myoblasts cultured on aligned PU fibers showed more pronounced elongation, better alignment, higher level of transient receptor potential cation channel-1 (TRPC-1) expression, upregulation of contractile proteins and higher percentage of striated myotubes compared to those cultured on random PU fibers and film. The resulting tissue constructs generated tetanus forces of 1.1 mN with a 10-ms time to tetanus. Additional mechanical, electrical, or synchronized electromechanical stimuli applied to myoblasts cultured on PU fibers increased the percentage of striated myotubes from 70 to 85% under optimal stimulation conditions, which was accompanied by an upregulation of contractile proteins such as α-actinin and myosin heavy chain. In describing how electromechanical cues can be combined with topographical cue, this study helped move towards the goal of generating a biomimetic microenvironment for engineering of functional skeletal muscle.",

        "Abstract": "Engineering polymeric gene-delivery vectors to release an intact DNA payload at the optimal time and subcellular compartment remains a formidable challenge. An ideal vector would provide total protection of complexed DNA from degradation prior to releasing it efficiently near or within the nucleus of a target cell. While optimization of polymer properties, such as molecular weight and charge density, has proved largely inadequate in addressing this challenge, applying polymeric carriers that respond to temperature, light, pH and redox environment to trigger a switch from a tight, protective complex to a more relaxed interaction favouring release at the appropriate time and place has shown promise. Currently, a paucity of gene carriers able to satisfy the contrary requirements of adequate DNA protection and efficient release contributes to the slow progression of non-viral gene therapy towards clinical translation. This review highlights the promising carrier designs that may achieve an optimal balance of DNA protection and release. It also discusses the imaging techniques and three-dimensional in vitro models that can help study these two barriers in the non-viral gene transfer process. Ultimately, efficacious non-viral gene therapy will depend on the combination of intelligent material design, innovative imaging techniques and sophisticated in vitro model systems to facilitate the rational design of polymeric gene-delivery vectors.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in genomics continue to fuel the development of therapeutics that can target pathogenesis at the cellular and molecular level. Typically functional inside the cell, nucleic acid-based therapeutics require an efficient intracellular delivery system. One widely adopted approach is to complex DNA with a gene carrier to form nanocomplexes via electrostatic self-assembly, facilitating cellular uptake of DNA while protecting it against degradation. The challenge lies in the rational design of efficient gene carriers, since premature dissociation or overly stable binding would be detrimental to the cellular uptake and therapeutic efficacy. Nanocomplexes synthesized by bulk mixing showed a diverse range of intracellular unpacking and trafficking behavior, which was attributed to the heterogeneity in size and stability of nanocomplexes. Such heterogeneity hinders the accurate assessment of the self-assembly kinetics and adds to the difficulty in correlating their physical properties to transfection efficiencies or bioactivities. We present a novel convergence of nanophotonics (i.e. QD-FRET) and microfluidics to characterize the real-time kinetics of the nanocomplex self-assembly under laminar flow. QD-FRET provides a highly sensitive indication of the onset of molecular interactions and quantitative measure throughout the synthesis process, whereas microfluidics offers a well-controlled microenvironment to spatially analyze the process with high temporal resolution (~milliseconds). For the model system of polymeric nanocomplexes, two distinct stages in the self-assembly process were captured by this analytic platform. The kinetic aspect of the self-assembly process obtained at the microscale would be particularly valuable for microreactor-based reactions which are relevant to many micro- and nano-scale applications. Further, nanocomplexes may be customized through proper design of microfludic devices, and the resulting QD-FRET polymeric DNA nanocomplexes could be readily applied for establishing structure-function relationships.",

Students were not allowed to attend school if their temperature readings were >37.8 degrees C for students < or =12 years old, or > or =37.5 degrees C for students >12 years old.

        "Abstract": "Electrospinning and electrospraying are facile electrohydrodynamic fabrication methods that can generate drug delivery systems (DDS) through a one-step process. The nanostructured fiber and particle morphologies produced by these techniques offer tunable release kinetics applicable to diverse biomedical applications. Coaxial electrospinning/electrospraying, a relatively new technique of fabricating core-shell fibers/particles have added to the versatility of these DDS by affording a near zero-order drug release kinetics, dampening of burst release, and applicability to a wider range of bioactive agents. Controllable electrospinning/spraying of fibers and particles and subsequent drug release from these chiefly polymeric vehicles depends on well-defined solution and process parameters. The additional drug delivery capability from electrospun fibers can further enhance the material's functionality in tissue engineering applications.

        "Title": "Sustained viral gene delivery through core-shell fibers.",
        "Abstract": "Although viral gene transfer is efficient in achieving transgene expression for tissue engineering, drawbacks of virus dissemination, toxicity and transient gene expression due to immune response have hindered its widespread application. Many tissue engineering studies thus opt to genetically engineer cells in vitro prior to their introduction in vivo. However, it would be attractive to obviate the need for in vitro manipulation by transducing the infiltrating progenitor cells in situ. This study introduces the fabrication of a virus-encapsulated electrospun fibrous scaffold to achieve sustained and localized transduction. Adenovirus encoding the gene for green fluorescent protein was efficiently encapsulated into the core of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) fibers through co-axial electrospinning and was subsequently released via a porogen-mediated process. HEK 293 cells seeded on the scaffolds expressed high level of transgene expression over a month, while cells inoculated by scaffold supernatant showed only transient expression for a week. RAW 264.7 cells cultured on the virus-encapsulated fibers produced a lower level of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha, suggesting that the activation of macrophage cells by the viral vector was reduced when encapsulated in the core-shell PCL fibers. In demonstrating sustained and localized cell transduction, this study presents an attractive alternative mode of applying viral gene transfer for regenerative medicine.",

Despite these advantages it remains difficult to achieve satisfactory bioavailability levels via oral administration due to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, particularly for biomacromolecules. One promising method to increase the bioavailability of macromolecular drugs such as proteins and nucleic acids is to encapsulate them in nanoparticles before oral administration. This review describes innovative strategies for increasing the efficacy of nanoparticle-mediated delivery to the GI tract. Approaches to optimize nanoparticle formulation by exploiting mucoadhesion, environmental responsiveness and external delivery control mechanisms are discussed. The application of recent advances in nanoparticle synthesis using supercritical fluids, microfluidics and imprint lithography to oral delivery are also presented, as well as possible strategies for incorporating nanoparticles into micro- and macroscale oral delivery devices.",

To evaluate the potential of this approach, we studied the oral gene delivery efficacy of DNA polyplexes composed of chitosan and Factor VIII DNA. Transgene DNA was detected in both local and systemic tissues following oral administration of the chitosan nanoparticles to hemophilia A mice. Functional factor VIII protein was detected in plasma by chromogenic and thrombin generation assays, reaching a peak level of 2-4% FVIII at day 22 after delivery. In addition, a bleeding challenge one month after DNA administration resulted in phenotypic correction in 13/20 mice given 250-600 microg of FVIII DNA in chitosan nanoparticles, compared to 1/13 mice given naked FVIII DNA and 0/6 untreated mice. While further optimization would be required to render this type of delivery system practical for hemophilia A gene therapy, the findings suggest the feasibility of oral, non-viral delivery for gene medicine applications.",

        "Abstract": "Sustained release of proteins from aligned polymeric fibers holds great potential in tissue-engineering applications. These protein-polymer composite fibers possess high surface-area-to-volume ratios for cell attachment, and can provide biochemical and topographic cues to enhance tissue regeneration. Aligned biodegradable polymeric fibers that encapsulate human glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, 0.13 wt%) were fabricated via electrospinning a copolymer of caprolactone and ethyl ethylene phosphate (PCLEEP) with GDNF. The protein was randomly dispersed throughout the polymer matrix in aggregate form, and released in a sustained manner for up to two months. The efficacy of these composite fibers was tested in a rat model for peripheral nerve-injury treatment. Rats were divided into four groups, receiving either empty PCLEEP tubes (control); tubes with plain PCLEEP electrospun fibers aligned longitudinally (EF-L) or circumferentially (EF-C); or tubes with aligned GDNF-PCLEEP fibers (EF-L-GDNF). After three months, bridging of a 15 mm critical defect gap by the regenerated nerve was observed in all the rats that received nerve conduits with electrospun fibers, as opposed to 50% in the control group. Electrophysiological recovery was seen in 20%, 33%, and 44% of the rats in the EF-C, EF-L, and EF-L-GDNF groups respectively, whilst none was observed in the controls. This study has demonstrated that, without further modification, plain electrospun fibers can help in peripheral nerve regeneration; however, the synergistic effect of an encapsulated growth factor facilitated a more significant recovery. This study also demonstrated the novel use of electrospinning to incorporate biochemical and topographical cues into a single implant for in vivo tissue-engineering applications.",

        "Abstract": "Polyelectrolyte complexes have been widely studied as gene carriers in recent years. In this study, poly (ethylene imine) was grafted onto chitosan (PEI-g-CHI) as a nonviral gene carrier in order to improve the water solubility as well as the inherent transfection efficiency of chitosan. We present a novel method to conjugate the amine or hydroxyl groups of chitosan (CHI) and the amine groups of PEI through opening the epoxide rings of ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EX-810), which also brings the merits as mentioned in PEGylation chemistry. The degree of substitution of PEI onto CHI was characterized by NMR. The preliminarily cellular mechanisms, from the cellular entry to the endosomal release, were investigated by the correlations among the physicochemical properties of the DNA-polymer complexes, the buffering capacity of the modified polymer, the cytotoxicity, and the efficiency of the transgene expression. The cytotoxicity assayed by MTT shows that cell viability of PEI-g-CHI is higher than CHI especially noticeable at high concentrations using human kidney 293T cells. The efficiency of transgene expression and the amount of intracellular plasmid were monitored using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The transfection efficiency of PEI-g-CHI/DNA polyplex is significantly better than CHI/DNA polyplex when using the weight ratios higher than 2.5.",

        "Abstract": "A major challenge for non-viral gene delivery is gaining a mechanistic understanding of the rate-limiting steps. A critical barrier in polyplex-mediated gene delivery is the timely unpacking of polyplexes within the target cell to liberate DNA for efficient gene transfer. In this study, the component plasmid DNA and polymeric gene carrier were individually labeled with quantum dots (QDs) and Cy5 dyes, respectively, as a donor and acceptor pair for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The high signal-to-noise ratio in QD-mediated FRET enabled sensitive detection of discrete changes in polyplex stability. The intracellular uptake and dissociation of polyplexes through QD-FRET was captured over time by confocal microscopy. From quantitative image-based analysis, distributions of released plasmid within the endo/lysosomal, cytosolic, and nuclear compartments formed the basis for constructing a three-compartment first-order kinetics model. Polyplex unpacking kinetics for chitosan, polyethylenimine, and polyphosphoramidate were compared and found to correlate well with transfection efficiencies. Thus, QD-FRET-enabled detection of polyplex stability combined with image-based quantification is a valuable method for studying mechanisms involved in polyplex unpacking and trafficking within live cells. We anticipate that this method will also aid the design of more efficient gene carriers.",

        "Abstract": "Biodegradable polymers were electrospun and recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) was immobilized on the electrospun nanofibers for the purpose of treating diabetic ulcers. Amine-terminated block copolymers composed of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) [PCL] and poly(ethyleneglycol) [PEG] and PCL were electrospun to biocompatible nanofibers with functional amine groups on the surface via PEG linkers. EGF was chemically conjugated to the surface of the nanofibers. The conjugation amount of EGF on the nanofibers was quantitated by X-ray photoelectron scattering. Human primary keratinocytes were cultivated on EGF-conjugated nanofibers in order to investigate the effect of EGF nanofibers on the differentiation of keratinocytes. Wound healing effects of the EGF nanofibers were confirmed in diabetic animals with dorsal wounds. The expression of keratinocyte-specific genes significantly increased with application of EGF-conjugated nanofibers. The EGF-nanofibers exerted superior in vivo wound healing activities compared to control groups or EGF solutions. Furthermore, immunohistochemical-staining results showed that EGF-receptor (EGFR) was highly expressed in the EGF nanofiber group. This study showed that EGF-conjugated nanofiber could potentially be employed as a novel wound healing material by increasing proliferation and phenotypic expression of keratinocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Peripheral nerve regeneration can be enhanced by the stimulation of formation of bands of Büngner prior to implantation. Aligned electrospun poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers were fabricated to test their potential to provide contact guidance to human Schwann cells. After 7 days of culture, cell cytoskeleton and nuclei were observed to align and elongate along the fiber axes, emulating the structure of bands of Büngner. Microarray analysis revealed a general down-regulation in expression of neurotrophin and neurotrophic receptors in aligned cells as compared to cells seeded on two-dimensional PCL film. Real-time-PCR analyses confirmed the up-regulation of early myelination marker, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and the down-regulation of NCAM-1, a marker of immature Schwann cells. Similar gene expression changes were also observed on cells cultured on randomly oriented PCL electrospun fibers. However, up-regulation of the myelin-specific gene, P0, was observed only on aligned electrospun fibers, suggesting the propensity of aligned fibers in promoting Schwann cell maturation.",

Anisotropic polymer scaffolds made by leaching of aligned sucrose templates were seeded with neonatal rat cardiac cells and cultured in rotating bioreactors for 6-14 days. Cells aligned and interconnected inside the scaffolds and when stimulated by a point electrode, supported macroscopically continuous, anisotropic impulse propagation. By culture day 14, the ratio of conduction velocities along vs. across cardiac fibers reached a value of 2, similar to that in native neonatal ventricles, while action potential duration and maximum capture rate, respectively, decreased to 120ms and increased to approximately 5Hz. The shorter culture time and larger scaffold thickness were associated with increased incidence of sustained reentrant arrhythmias. In summary, this study is the first successful attempt to engineer a cm(2)-size, functional anisotropic cardiac tissue patch.",

With cell source a major bottleneck in hepatic tissue engineering, we investigated whether commercially available human MSC (hMSC) can transdifferentiate into the hepatic lineage. Based on previous studies that find rapid gain of hepatic genes in bone marrow-derived stem cells cocultured with liver tissue, we used a similar approach to drive hepatic differentiation by coculturing the hMSC with rat livers treated or untreated with gadolinium chloride (GdCl(3)). After a 24-hour coculture period with liver tissue injured by GdCl(3) in a Transwell configuration, approximately 34% of the cells differentiated into albumin-expressing cells. Cocultured cells were subsequently maintained with growth factors to complete the hepatic differentiation. Cocultured cells expressed more hepatic gene markers, and had higher metabolic functions and P450 activity than cells that were only differentiated with growth factors. In conclusion, commercially available hMSC do show hepatic differentiation potential, and a liver microenvironment in culture can provide potent cues to accelerate and deepen the differentiation. The ability to generate hepatocyte-like cells from a commercially available cell source would find interesting applications in liver tissue engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation (PEC) fiber has been proposed as a biostructural unit and biological construct for tissue engineering applications, with its ability to incorporate proteins, drug molecules, DNA nanoparticles, and cells. In this study, we evaluated the biocompatibility and blood compatibility of PEC fiber in order to assess its potential for in vivo applications in tissue engineering. Although chitosan-alginate PEC fibrous scaffold was found to be thrombogenic, the blood compatibility of the scaffold could be significantly improved by incorporating a small amount of heparin in the polyelectrolyte solution during fiber formation. The platelet microparticle production and platelet adhesion on the chitosan-alginate-heparin fibrous scaffold were comparable to those on the resting control. In vitro cytotoxicity test showed that the scaffold was not toxic to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). In the in vivo biocompatibility test in rats, no acute inflammation was observed in the subcutaneously or intramuscularly implanted specimens. Good cell infiltration and vascularization were observed after 2 months of implantations. Enhanced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition was observed when hMSCs were cultured in the transforming growth factor-beta3 (TGF-beta3)-encapsulated PEC fibrous scaffold in vitro, or when the TGF-beta3-encapsulated PEC was implanted intramuscularly in vivo. The results showed that this versatile PEC fibrous scaffold could be used in various tissue engineering applications for its good biocompatible and blood compatible properties.",

        "Abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been shown to trans-differentiate into neuronal-like cells by culture in neuronal induction media, although the mechanism is not well understood. Topography can also influence cellular responses including enhanced differentiation of progenitor cells. As extracellular matrix (ECM) in vivo comprises topography in the nanoscale, we hypothesize that nanotopography could influence stem cell differentiation into specific non-default pathways, such as transdifferentiation of hMSCs. Differentiation and proliferation of hMSCs were studied on nanogratings of 350 nm width. Cytoskeleton and nuclei of hMSCs were aligned and elongated along the nanogratings. Gene profiling and immunostaining showed significant up-regulation of neuronal markers such as microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) compared to unpatterned and micropatterned controls. The combination of nanotopography and biochemical cues such as retinoic acid further enhanced the up-regulation of neuronal marker expressions, but nanotopography showed a stronger effect compared to retinoic acid alone on unpatterned surface. This study demonstrated the significance of nanotopography in directing differentiation of adult stem cells.",

        "Abstract": "Transfection of DNA vaccines with chemokines may recruit dendritic cells (DCs) locally to capture the antigenic genes and their gene products to generate enhanced CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In this study, we investigated the effects of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, MIP-3 alpha, and MIP-3beta on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Gag DNA vaccination. The chemokine plasmids markedly enhanced the local infiltration of inflammatory cells and increased the presence of CD11c(+) B7.2(+)-activated DCs. MIP-1 alpha and MIP-3 alpha were potent adjuvants in augmenting CTLs and afforded strong protection to immunized animals against challenge with vaccinia virus expressing Gag (vv-Gag). However, decreased humoral response was observed. MIP-3beta plasmid did not dramatically alter immunity. The chemokine inoculation time with respect to DNA vaccine priming was also investigated. The injection of pMIP-3 alpha three days before Gag plasmid (pGag) vaccination markedly increased specific CTLs compared with simultaneous injection and led to higher protection against vv-Gag. Immunity was also shifted toward a T-helper type-1 (Th1) response. In contrast, inoculation with pMIP-3 alpha three days after pGag vaccination shifted immunity toward a Th2 response. Our data suggest that administration of a chemokine with DNA vaccines offers a valuable strategy to modulate the efficacy and polarization of specific immunity and that chemokine-antigen timing is critical in determining overall biological effects.",

The majority of patterning studies on cellular response have been conducted on micropatterned surfaces. Cells clearly respond to the topography of substrates in the micron range in terms of adhesion, proliferation, migration, and gene expression. However, cells in their natural environment also interact with extracellular matrix components in the nanometer scale. This review will cover recent studies that show mammalian cells responding to nanoscale features on a synthetic surface. An important and exciting direction of research in nanomedicine would be to gain a better understanding of the interaction between cells and nanostructures.

        "Abstract": "Stem cells play increasingly prominent roles in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells theoretically allow every cell type in the body to be regenerated. Adult stem cells have also been identified and isolated from every major tissue and organ, some possessing apparent pluripotency comparable to that of ES cells. However, a major limitation in the translation of stem cell technologies to clinical applications is the supply of cells. Advances in biomaterials engineering and scaffold fabrication enable the development of ex vivo cell expansion systems to address this limitation. Progress in biomaterial design has also allowed directed differentiation of stem cells into specific lineages. In addition to delivering biochemical cues, various technologies have been developed to introduce micro- and nano-scale features onto culture surfaces to enable the study of stem cell responses to topographical cues. Knowledge gained from these studies portends the alteration of stem cell fate in the absence of biological factors, which would be valuable in the engineering of complex organs comprising multiple cell types. Biomaterials may also play an immunoprotective role by minimizing host immunoreactivity toward transplanted cells or engineered grafts.",

        "Abstract": "We demonstrate a highly sensitive method to characterize the structural composition and intracellular fate of polymeric DNA nanocomplexes, formed by condensing plasmid DNA with cationic polymers through electrostatic interactions. Rational design of more efficient polymeric gene carriers will be possible only with mechanistic insights of the rate-limiting steps in the non-viral gene transfer process. To characterize the composition and binding dynamics of nanocomplexes, plasmid and its polymer carrier within nanocomplexes were labeled with quantum dots (QDs) and fluorescent organic dyes, respectively, as a donor and acceptor pair for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The high signal-to-noise ratio in QD-mediated FRET enabled precise detection of discrete changes in nanocomplex state at the single-particle level, against various intracellular microenvironments. The distribution and unpacking of individual nanocomplexes within cells could thus be unambiguously followed by fluorescence microscopy. QD-FRET is a highly sensitive and quantitative method to determine the composition and dynamic stability of nanocomplexes during intracellular transport, where barriers to gene delivery may be identified to facilitate gene carrier optimization.",

        "Title": "Co-culture of umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells with human mesenchymal stem cells.",
        "Abstract": "Insufficient numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) sometimes limit allogenic transplantation of umbilical cord blood (UCB). Ex vivo expansion may overcome this limitation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as non-hematopoietic, well-characterized skeletal and connective-tissue progenitor cells within the bone marrow stroma, have been investigated as support cells for the culture of HSCs/HPCs. MSCs are attractive for the rich environmental signals that they provide and for immunological compatibility in transplantation. Thus far, HSC/MSC co-cultures have mainly been performed in 2-dimensional (2D) configuration. We postulate that a 3-dimensional (3D) culture environment that resembles the natural in vivo hematopoietic compartment might be more conducive for regulating HSC expansion. In this study, we compared the co-culture of HSCs and MSCs in 2D and 3D configurations. The results demonstrated the benefit of MSC inclusion in HSC expansion ex vivo. Direct contact between MSCs and HSCs in 3D cultures led to statistically significantly higher expansion of cord blood CD34+ cells than in 2D cultures (891- versus 545-fold increase in total cells, 96- versus 48-fold increase of CD34+ cells, and 230- versus 150-fold increase in colony-forming cell assay [CFC]). Engraftment assays in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice also indicated a high success rate of hematopoiesis reconstruction with these expanded cells.",

Human MSCs were either encapsulated in PEC fibers and constructed into a fibrous scaffold or seeded on PEC fibrous scaffolds. The proliferation, chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of the encapsulated and seeded hMSCs were compared for a culture period of 5.5 weeks. Gene expression and extracellular matrix production showed evidences of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in the cell-encapsulated scaffolds and cell-seeded scaffolds when the samples were cultured in the chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation media, respectively. However, better cell proliferation and differentiation were observed on the hMSC-encapsulated scaffolds compared to the hMSC-seeded scaffolds. The study demonstrated that the cell-encapsulated PEC fibers could support proliferation and chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of the encapsulated-hMSCs. Together with our previous works, which demonstrated the feasibility of PEC fiber in controlled release of drug, protein and gene delivery, the reported PEC fibrous scaffold system will have the potential in composing a multi-component system for various tissue-engineering applications.",

        "Abstract": "The mechanical and structural properties of a surface play an important role in determining the morphology of attached cells, and ultimately their cellular functions. As such, mechanical and structural integrity are important design parameters for a tissue scaffold. Electrospun fibrous meshes are widely used in tissue engineering. When in contact with electrospun scaffolds, cells see the individual micro- or nanofibres as their immediate microenvironment. In this study, tensile testing of single electrospun nanofibres composed of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), and its copolymer, poly(caprolactone-co-ethyl ethylene phosphate) (PCLEEP), revealed a size effect in the Young's modulus, E, and tensile strength, σ(T). Both strength and stiffness increase as the fibre diameter decreases from bulk (∼5 μm) into the nanometre region (200-300 nm). In particular, E and σ(T) of individual PCL nanofibres were at least two-fold and an order of magnitude higher than that of PCL film, respectively. PCL films were observed to have more pronounced crystallographic texture than the nanofibres; however no difference in crystalline fraction, perfection, or texture was detected among the various fibres. When drugs were encapsulated into single PCLEEP fibres, mechanical properties were enhanced with 1-20 wt% of loaded retinoic acid, but weakened by 10-20 wt% of encapsulated bovine serum albumin. This understanding of the effect of size and drug and protein encapsulation on the mechanical properties of electrospun fibres may help in the optimization of tissue scaffold design that combines biochemical and biomechanical cues for tissue regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s containing tertiary amines in the core and primary, secondary, and tertiary amines in the periphery, respectively, were evaluated for DNA delivery in vitro. The same core structure facilitated the investigation on the effects of the terminal amine type on the properties of hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s for DNA delivery. The hydrolysis of the poly(amino ester)s was monitored using (1)H NMR. The results reflected that the terminal amine type had negligible effects on the hydrolysis rate but was much slower than that of linear poly(amino ester)s, probably due to the compact hyperbranched spatial structure preventing the accessibility of water. In comparison with PEI 25 K, the hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s showed much lower cytotoxicity in Cos7, HEK293, and HepG2 cells. Gel electrophoresis indicated that poly(amino ester)s could condense DNA efficiently, and the zeta potentials and sizes of the complexes formed with different weight ratios of hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s and DNA were measured. Remarkably, all the hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s showed DNA transfection efficiency comparable to PEI 25 K in Cos7, HEK293, and HepG2 cells regardless of the terminal amine type. Therefore, the terminal amine type had insignificant effects on the hydrolysis rate, cytotoxicity, DNA condensation capability, and in vitro DNA transfection efficiency of the hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s.",

        "Abstract": "Although the field of gene delivery is dominated by viral vectors and synthetic polymeric or lipid gene carriers, natural polymers offer distinct advantages and may help advance the field of non-viral gene therapy. Natural polymers, such as chitosan, have been successful in oral and nasal delivery due to their mucoadhesive properties. Collagen has broad utility as gene activated matrices, capable of delivering large quantities of DNA in a direct, localized manner. Most natural polymers contain reactive sites amenable for ligand conjugation, cross-linking, and other modifications that can render the polymer tailored for a range of clinical applications. Natural polymers also often possess good cytocompatibility, making them popular choices for tissue engineering scaffolding applications. The marriage of gene therapy and tissue engineering exploits the power of genetic cell engineering to provide the biochemical signals to influence proliferation or differentiation of cells. Natural polymers with their ability to serve as gene carriers and tissue engineering scaffolds are poised to play an important role in the field of regenerative medicine. This review highlights the past and present research on various applications of natural polymers as particulate and matrix delivery vehicles for gene delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Controlled release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) protein by albumin-heparin microparticles administered via intramuscular vaccination in conjunction with HIV DNA vaccines stimulated HIV Gag-specific immune responses. In the murine model, Gag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and T helper (Th) responses were significantly enhanced by administration of murine GM-CSF microparticles. This effect was comparable to a GM-CSF encoded plasmid. In three of four rhesus monkeys, enhancement of Gag-specific antibody (Ab), Th, and CTL responses was observed 1 month after the first immunization with coadministration of human GM-CSF microparticles and HIV Gag plasmid. The second, third, and fourth booster immunizations, however, did not increase the Gag-specific immune responses. Subsequent application of Gag protein in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) significantly enhanced Ab and Th, but not CTL. However, Gag-specific CTL response was triggered by cytokine and Gag p55-encapsulated microparticles in all animals. The strategy of priming immune responses by coadministration of cytokine microparticles and DNA vaccines, followed by boosting with cytokine and antigen protein-encapsulated microparticles, may prove effective in improving an HIV DNA vaccine design.",

        "Abstract": "Extracellular environment regulates cell behavior and also influences the differentiation of stem cells. Two cell lines of pluriopotent human embryonic germ cell derivatives (EBD cells) were cultured on a biodegradable poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-ethyl ethylene phosphate) (PCLEEP) and non-degradable cellulose acetate scaffold. Their cell behaviors including proliferation, differentiation, cell distribution and extracellular matrix production were studied for 4 weeks and 10 months. The proliferation of the EBD cells was enhanced in both of the three-dimensional scaffolds in the first 5 weeks of culture, regardless of the material difference, compared to monolayer culture. While the gene expression profile remained multilineage for the EBD cells cultured in the cellulose acetate fibrous scaffold, much of the neuronal lineage markers were down-regulated in EBD cells cultured in the PCLEEP scaffold. On the other hand, extracellular matrix production was significantly enhanced in the PCLEEP scaffold. The study showed that the polymer substrate could influence the differentiation and growth of pluripotent stem cells in the absence of exogenous biochemical signals.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of the combination of caspase-3 gene therapy and radiation treatment. We prepared a plasmid (pCI-CSP3) that contained the human caspase-3 gene and the cytomegalovirus promoter. We introduced this plasmid into U251 and U87 human glioma cells and subjected the cells to radiation treatment. The degree of cell death and apoptosis were evaluated. None of the cell lines underwent apoptosis by the overexpression of caspase-3 alone, but the degree of cell death and apoptosis were markedly enhanced by the addition of radiation treatment. Next, we prepared another plasmid (EGR-CSP3) that contained the caspase-3 gene and a radiation-sensitive promoter. Each treatment system using either pCI-CSP3 or EGR-CSP3 showed radio response. The treatment system using pCI-CSP3 more effectively induced apoptosis than that using EGR-CSP3. Caspase-3 gene therapy in combination with radiation treatment has the potential to serve as a radio-responsive gene therapy without any radiation-sensitive promoter.",

        "Abstract": "Extensive cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction in three-dimensional (3D) culture is important for the maintenance of adult hepatocyte function and the maturation of hepatic progenitors. However, although there is significant interest in inducing the transdifferentiation of adult stem cells into the hepatic lineage, very few studies have been conducted in a 3D culture configuration. The aim of this study is to investigate the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into hepatocytes in a pellet configuration, with or without the presence of small intestinal submucosa (SIS). After 4 weeks of differentiation with growth factors bFGF, HGF, and OsM, we obtained hepatocyte-like cells that expressed a subset of hepatic genes, secreted albumin and urea, stored glycogen, and showed inducible CYP3A4 mRNA levels. When these cells were implanted into livers of hepatectomized rats, they secreted human albumin into the bloodstream. The hepatic differentiation of MSC was faster in cell pellets without SIS. The plausible explanations for this finding may be related to the mass transport issues of the two different pellets and the role of cell-cell contact over cell-matrix interactions. The findings of this study should help in the design of optimal culture configurations for efficient hepatic differentiation of adult stem cells.",

The cooperation effect of complexation of PEO segments with alpha-cyclodextrin and the hydrophobic interaction between PHB blocks resulted in the formation of the supramolecular hydrogel with a strong macromolecular network. The in vitro release kinetics studies of fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled dextran (dextran-FITC) model drug from the hydrogel showed that the hydrogel was suitable for relatively long-term sustained controlled release of macromolecular drugs, which many simple triblock copolymer hydrogel systems could not achieve. The hydrogel was found to be thixotropic and reversible, and can be applied as a promising injectable drug delivery system.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated a novel nonwoven fibrous scaffold as a vehicle for delivery of DNA. Fibers were formed by polyelectrolyte complexation of water-soluble chitin and alginate, and PEI-DNA nanoparticles were encapsulated during the fiber drawing process. Nanoparticles released from the fibers over time retained their bioactivity and successfully transfected cells seeded on the scaffold in a sustained manner. Transgene expression in HEK293 cells and human dermal fibroblasts seeded on the transfecting scaffolds was significant even after 2 weeks of culture compared to 3-day expression in two-dimensional controls. Fibroblasts seeded on scaffolds containing DNA encoding basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) demonstrated prolonged secretion of bFGF at levels significantly higher than baseline. This work establishes the potential of this fibrous scaffold as a matrix capable of delivering genes to direct and support cellular development in tissue engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Polyethylenimine-graft-chitosan (PEI-g-chitosan) was synthesized by performing cationic polymerization of aziridine in the presence of water-soluble oligo-chitosan (M(n) = 3400). The absolute molecular weight and chemistry of the PEI-g-chitosan obtained were characterized using GPC, 13C and 1H NMR, respectively. The results indicated that all the amines of chitosan were grafted with oligo-PEI, and the average length of the oligo-PEI side chains was determined by the feed molar ratio of aziridne/amine in chitosan. PEI-g-chitosan of M(n) = 7400 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.50, and PEI side chains of M(n) = 206 was prepared for gene delivery. Gel electrophoresis showed that DNA migration was retarded completely at a N/P ratio of 2.5/1, indicating good DNA condensation capability of PEI-g-chitosan. The sizes and the zeta-potentials of the complexes of PEI-g-chitosan/DNA were characterized. The cytotoxicity of PEI-g-chiotsan was evaluated, and the results reflected that PEI-g-chitosan had a lower cytotoxicity than PEI (25 K). Gene transfection efficiency of PEI-g-chitosan in HepG2, HeLa, and primary hepatocytes cells and after administration in the common bile duct of rat liver was determined. Remarkably, PEI-g-chitosan showed a higher transfection efficiency than that of PEI (25 K) both in vitro and in vivo. The systematic distribution and the distribution in liver of the gene expression of the complexes of PEI-chitosan/DNA were determined as well.",

        "Abstract": "To overcome the limitations of long-term expression of highly differentiated hepatocyte functions, we have developed a novel bioreactor in which hepatocytes are seeded in a ligand-immobilized hollow fiber cartridge. Galactosylated Pluronic polymer is immobilized on poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) hollow fiber surface through an adsorption scheme yielding a substrate with hepatocyte-specific ligand and a hydrophilic surface layer, which can resist nonspecific protein adsorption and facilitate cell binding to the galactose ligand. Interestingly, the galactosylated PVDF hollow fiber shows enhanced serum albumin diffusion across the membrane. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were seeded and cultured in the extralumenal space of the hollow fiber cartridge for 18 days in a continuously circulated system. Albumin secretion function of the seeded hepatocytes was monitored by analyzing circulating medium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Urea synthesis and P-450 function (7-ethoxycoumarin dealkylase activity) were measured periodically by doping the circulating medium with NH4Cl and 7-ethoxycoumarin, respectively. Hepatocytes cultured on galactosylated PVDF hollow fibers maintained better albumin secretion and P-450 functions than on unmodified and serum-coated PVDF hollow fibers when cultured in serum-containing medium. Morphological examination by scanning electron microscopy showed that hepatocytes cultured on galactosylated PVDF hollow fibers developed significant aggregation, in contrast to those cultured on unmodified PVDF fibers or on serum-coated PVDF fibers. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed that tight junctions and canaliculus-like structures formed in these aggregates. These results suggest the potential application of this galactosylated PVDF hollow fiber cartridge for the design of a bioartificial liver assist device.",

        "Title": "Surface-immobilization of adhesion peptides on substrate for ex vivo expansion of cryopreserved umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells.",
        "Abstract": "The interaction between integrins and extracellular matrix proteins play an important role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Human hematopoietic progenitor cells express very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) and VLA-5, which mediate their interaction with fibronectin by recognizing the connecting segment-1 (CS-1 and RGD motifs, respectively. In this study, we investigated the ex vivo expansion of human umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+ cells on synthetic substrates surface-immobilized with peptides containing the CS-1 binding motif (EILDVPST) and the RGD motif (GRGDSPC). These peptides were covalently conjugated to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film at a surface density of 2.0-2.3 nmol/cm2. UCB CD34+ cells were cultured for 10 days in serum-free medium supplemented with recombinant human thrombopoietin, stem cell factor, flt3-ligand and interleukin 3. The highest cell expansion fold was observed on the CS-1 peptide-modified surface, where total nucleated cells, total colony forming unit, and long-term culture initiating cells were expanded by 589.6+/-58.6 (mean+/-s.d.), 76.5+/-8.8, and 3.2+/-0.9-fold, respectively, compared to unexpanded cells. All substrates surface-immobilized with peptides, including the control peptides, were more efficient in supporting the expansion of CD34+, CFU-GEMM and LTC-ICs than tissue culture polystyrene surface. Nevertheless, after 10-days of ex vivo expansion from 600 CD34+ cells, only cells cultured on CS-1-immobilized surface yielded positive engraftment, even though the frequency was low. PET surface immobilized with RGD peptide was less efficient than that with CS-1 peptide. Our results suggest that covalently immobilized adhesion peptides can significantly influence the proliferation characteristics of cultured UCB CD34+ cells.",

        "Abstract": "New hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s were synthesized via A3 + 2BB'B' ' approach, represented by the Michael addition polymerization of trimethylol-propane triacrylate (TMPTA) (A3-type monomers) with a double molar 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine (AEPZ) (BB'B''-type monomer) performed in chloroform at ambient temperature. The results obtained by in situ monitoring the polymerization using NMR and MS indicated that hyperbranched poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) was formed via a A(B'B'')2 intermediate, and the B' ' (the formed 2 degrees amine) was kept intact in the reaction. Therefore, poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) contained secondary and tertiary amines in the core and primary amines in the periphery similar to polyethylenimine (PEI). The chemistry of protonated poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) was further confirmed by 13C NMR, and the molecular weight, the radius of gyration (Rg), and the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) were determined using GPC, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and laser dynamic light scattering (LDLS), respectively. The ratio of Rg/Rh of ca. 1.1 verified the hyperbranched structure. Protonated hyperbranched poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) is degradable and less cytotoxic as compared with PEI (25 K). Gel electrophoresis reflected that stable complexes could be formed from protonated hyperbranched poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) and DNA, and the size and xi-potential of the complexes were characterized. Remarkably, protonated hyperbranched poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) showed transfection efficiency comparable to PEI (25 k) for in vitro DNA delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Human embryonic germ cell derivatives, a heterogeneous population of uncommitted embryoid body derived (EBD) cells, were studied in a bioactive three-dimensional (3D) fibrous culture. Their proliferation, morphology, gene expression and differentiation were investigated to gain insights on development of 3D bioactive scaffold for pluripotent stem cells. The expansion of the EBD cells in 3D environment was significantly higher than their two-dimensional controls after 21 days. No apparent differentiation of the EBD cells cultured in the 3D environment, as indicated by histology and gene expression profile analysis, was evident. Extracellular matrix production was weak in the long-term 3D culture, and the EBD cells maintained their multilineage gene expressions for the period studied. When nerve growth factor (NGF) was surface-immobilized on the fibrous scaffold via chemically-modified Pluronic, the EBD cells cultured in this scaffold showed evidence of entering the neural pathway. An upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression was observed when EBD cells were cultured in the NGF-immobilized fibrous scaffold, as demonstrated by real-time PCR and immunofluorescence staining. The study suggests the value of such fibrous 3D culture in manipulating stem cell proliferation/differentiation and as a model for developing a bioactive scaffold.",

        "Abstract": "This paper reports the studies on micelle formation of new biodegradable amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide)-poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate]-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PHB-PEO) triblock copolymer with various PHB and PEO block lengths in aqueous solution. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the micelles took an approximately spherical shape with the surrounding diffuse outer shell formed by hydrophilic PEO blocks. The size distribution of the micelles formed by one triblock copolymer was demonstrated by dynamic light scattering technique. The critical micellization phenomena of the copolymers were extensively studied using the pyrene fluorescence dye absorption technique, and the (0,0) band changes of pyrene excitation spectra were used as a probe for the studies. For the copolymers studied in this report, the critical micelle concentrations ranged from 1.3 x 10(-5) to 1.1 x 10(-3) g/mL. For the same PEO block length of 5000, the critical micelle concentrations decreased with an increase in PHB block length, and the change was more significant in the short PHB range. It was found that the micelle formation of the biodegradable amphiphilic triblock copolymers consisting of poly(beta-hydroxyalkanoic acid) and PEO was relatively temperature-insensitive, which is quite different from their counterparts consisting of poly(alpha-hydroxyalkanoic acid) and PEO.",

        "Abstract": "Autologous tumor-specific T lymphocyte (ATTL) lines were derived from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of a healthy volunteer with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -A*0201. These lines were achieved using interleukins -1beta, -2, -4, and -6 and the p53-based peptide from the 264-272 sequence of the wild-type p53 protein with a strong affinity against HLA-A*0201.;The frequencies of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocytes were 94-96%, 30-34%, and 69-74%, respectively. ATTLs killed most of the T2 cells pulsed with p53-derived peptide, but not against the T2 cells non-pulsed or pulsed with an irrelevant peptide. ATTLs also killed TKB-14 cells, which have been derived from human glioblastoma multiforme, and exhibited HLA-A*0201 molecule and immunohistochemical accumulation of p53 protein. These cytotoxic activities were inhibited by anti-CD3, anti-CD8, and anti-class I antibodies. These findings suggested that these ATTL lines might include CTL populations, which could recognize p53-derived peptide on HLA-A*0201 and the p53-based peptide may play as an antigen on HLA-A*0201. When tumor antigens would be more analyzed in the future, ATTL could be induced without the primary-cultured cells from tumor tissue and could be applied for cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "A new biodegradable, photocrosslinkable and multifunctional macromer, poly(6-aminohexyl propylene phosphate) (PPE-HA)-ACRL, was synthesized by conjugation of acrylate groups to the side chains of PPE-HA. By controlling the synthetic conditions, different weight fractions of acrylate in the macromers were achieved as confirmed by 1H NMR. The hydrogels obtained from PPE-HA-ACRL through photocrosslinking were dominantly elastic. With increasing acrylate contents in the macromers, the hydrogels exhibited a lower swelling ratio and higher mechanical strength. The hydrogels with different crosslinking densities lost between 4.3% and 37.4% of their mass in 84 days when incubated in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 degrees C. No significant cytotoxicity of the macromers against bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells from goat (GMSC) was observed at a concentration up to 10mg/ml. Finally, GMSCs encapsulated in the photopolymerized gel maintained their viability when cultured in osteogenic medium for three weeks. Clear mineralization in the hydrogel scaffold was revealed by Von Kossa staining. This study suggests the potential of these biodegradable and photocrosslinkable as injectable tissue engineering scaffolds.",

        "Abstract": "Temperature-responsive polymers are attractive candidates for applications related to injectable delivery of biologically active therapeutics, such as stem cells. In this study, we evaluate the potential of thermosensitive hydroxybutyl chitosan (HBC) as a biomaterial for the culture of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and cells derived from the intervertebral disk, with the eventual goal of using the HBC polymer as an injectable matrix/cell therapeutic. Conjugation of hydroxybutyl groups to chitosan renders the polymer water soluble and thermally responsive. Below its lower critical solution temperature, a solution of HBC can be maintained indefinitely in its solvated state. Upon exposure to a 37 degrees C environment, within 60 s, a 3.8 wt% HBC solution rapidly forms a gel that can be maneuvered with forceps. Upon cooling, the gel once again is able to revert to its solvated state. The gel exhibits a dramatic increase in both G' and G'' with increasing temperature, signifying a temperature-dependent enhancement of gel mechanical properties. Although a solid structure upon gelation, due to its physical nature of polymer interaction and gel formation, the gel exhibits a fluid-like viscoelastic behavior when exposed to shear stresses of up to 10% strain, with both G' and G'' approaching zero with increasing shear stress. Formulations of HBC gels presented in this study have gelation temperatures ranging from 13.0 to 34.6 degrees C and water contents of 67-95%. Minimal cytotoxicity in MSC and disk cell cultures was observed with these polymers up to a concentration of 5 wt%. Detection of metabolic activity, genetic analysis of synthesized mRNA, and histological staining of MSC and disk cell cultures in these gels collectively indicate cell proliferation without a loss in metabolic activity and extracellular matrix production. This study suggests the potential of HBC gel as an injectable carrier for future applications of delivering therapeutics to encourage a biologically relevant reconstruction of the degenerated disk.",

        "Abstract": "Electrospinning is a simple and versatile technique of producing polymeric fibers ranging from submicron to micron in diameter. Incorporation of bioactive agents into the fibers could make a biofunctional tissue engineering scaffold. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of encapsulating human beta-nerve growth factor (NGF), which was stabilized in a carrier protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a copolymer of epsilon-caprolactone and ethyl ethylene phosphate (PCLEEP) by electrospinning. Partially aligned protein encapsulated fibers were obtained and the protein was found to be randomly dispersed throughout the electrospun fibrous mesh in aggregate form. A sustained release of NGF via diffusion process was obtained for at least 3 months. PC12 neurite outgrowth assay confirmed that the bioactivity of electrospun NGF was retained, at least partially, throughout the period of sustained release, thus clearly demonstrating the feasibility of encapsulating proteins via electrospinning to produce biofunctional tissue scaffolds.",

        "Abstract": "Controlled release systems for delicate compounds, such as proteins, often suffer the drawbacks of decreased bioactivity and low encapsulation efficiency. This study introduces the concept of producing drug-loaded fibers from interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation. Chitosan-alginate fibers were produced by pulling from the interface between two polyelectrolyte solutions at room temperature. Depending on the component properties, the release time of encapsulated components from these fibers can range from hours to weeks. Dexamethasone was completely released within 2 h, whereas charged compounds such as BSA, PDGF-bb, and avidin showed sustained release for 3 weeks. The fibers were able to release PDGF-bb in a steady fashion for over 3 weeks without an initial burst. Furthermore, the bioactivity of PDGF-bb was retained over this period. Release kinetics could be controlled by the inclusion of heparin, which contains specific binding sites for various growth factors. By varying the alginate/heparin ratios in the anionic polyelectrolyte solution, the release of PDGF-bb could be significantly altered. In this study, interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation has been demonstrated to be a promising technique for producing drug-loaded fibers with high encapsulation efficiency, sustained release kinetics, and capacity to retain the bioactivity of the encapsulants.",

        "Abstract": "Polymer-supported lipid bilayer is a key enabling technology for the design and fabrication of novel biomimetic devices. To date, the physical driving force underlying the formation of polymer-supported lipid bilayer remains to be determined. In this study, the interaction between dipalmitoylphosphocholine (DPPC) vesicle and poly(ethylene terephthalate) [PET] surface with or without grafted poly(acrylic acid) [PAA] layer is examined with several biophysical techniques. First, vesicle deformation analysis shows that the geometry of adherent vesicle on either plain PET or PAA-grafted PET surface is best described by a truncated sphere model. At neutral pH, the degree of deformation and adhesion energy are unaltered by the grafted polymerization of acrylic acid on PET surface. Interestingly, the average magnitude of adhesion energy is increased by 185% and -43% on PAA-grated PET and plain PET surface, respectively, towards an increase of pH at room temperature. Our results demonstrate the possibility of tuning the adhesive interaction between vesicle and polymer cushion through the control of polyelectrolyte ionization on the solid support.",

        "Abstract": "Cells are known to be surrounded by nanoscale topography in their natural extracellular environment. The cell behavior, including morphology, proliferation, and motility of bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (SMC) were studied on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) surfaces comprising nanopatterned gratings with 350 nm linewidth, 700 nm pitch, and 350 nm depth. More than 90% of the cells aligned to the gratings, and were significantly elongated compared to the SMC cultured on non-patterned surfaces. The nuclei were also elongated and aligned. Proliferation of the cells was significantly reduced on the nanopatterned surfaces. The polarization of microtubule organizing centers (MTOC), which are associated with cell migration, of SMC cultured on nanopatterned surfaces showed a preference towards the axis of cell alignment in an in vitro wound healing assay. In contrast, the MTOC of SMC on non-patterned surfaces preferentially polarized towards the wound edge. It is proposed that this nanoimprinting technology will provide a valuable platform for studies in cell-substrate interactions and for development of medical devices with nanoscale features.",

        "Title": "Biodegradable poly(terephthalate-co-phosphate)s: synthesis, characterization and drug-release properties.",
        "Abstract": "To develop biodegradable polymers with favorable physicochemical and biological properties, we have synthesized a series of poly(terephthalate-co-phosphate)s using a two-step poly-condensation. The diol 1,4-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate was first reacted with ethylphosphorodichloridate (EOP), and then chain-extended with terephthaloyl chloride (TC). Incorporation of phosphate into the poly(ethylene terephthalate) backbone rendered the co-polymers soluble in chloroform and biodegradable, lowered the Tg, decreased the crystallinity and increased the hydrophilicity. With an EOP/TC molar feed ratio of 80: 20, the polymer exhibited good film-forming property, yielding at 86.6 +/- 1.6% elongation with an elastic modulus of 13.76 +/- 2.66 MPa. This polymer showed a favorable toxicity profile in vitro and good tissue biocompatibility in the muscular tissue of mice. In vitro the polymer lost 21% of mass in 21 days, but only 20% for up to 4 months in vivo. It showed no deterioration of properties after sterilization by gamma-irradiation at 2.5 Mrad on solid CO2. Release of FITC-BSA from the microspheres was diffusion-controlled and exceeded 80% completion in two days. Release of the hydrophobic cyclosporine-A from microspheres was however much more sustained and near zero-ordered, discharging 60% in 70 days. A limited structure-property relationship has been established for this co-polymer series. The co-polymers became more hydrolytically labile as the phosphate component (EOP) was increased and the side chains were switched from the ethoxy to the methoxy structure. Converting the methoxy group to a sodium salt further increased the degradation rate significantly. The chain rigidity as reflected in the Tg values of the co-polymers decreased according to the following diol structure in the backbone: ethylene glycol > 2-methylpropylene diol > 2,2-dimethylpropylene diol. The wide range of physicochemical properties obtainable from this co-polymer series should help the design of degradable biomaterials for specific biomedical applications.",

        "Title": "Galactosylated ternary DNA/polyphosphoramidate nanoparticles mediate high gene transfection efficiency in hepatocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Galactosylated polyphosphoramidates (Gal-PPAs) with different ligand substitution degrees (6.5%, 12.5% and 21.8%, respectively) were synthesized and evaluated as hepatocyte-targeted gene carriers. The in vitro cytotoxicity of Gal-PPA decreased significantly with an increase in galactose substitution degree. The affinity of Gal-PPA/DNA nanoparticles to galactose-recognizing lectin increased with galactose substitution degree. However, decreased transfection efficiency was observed for these galactosylated PPAs in HepG2 cells. Based on the results of gel retardation and polyanion competition assays, we hypothesized that the reduced transfection efficiency of Gal-PPA/DNA nanoparticles was due to their decreased DNA-binding capacity and decreased particle stability. We therefore prepared nanoparticles by precondensing DNA with PPA at a charge ratio of 0.5, yielding nanoparticles with negative surface charge, followed by coating with Gal-PPA, resulting in a Gal-PPA/ DNA/PPA ternary complex. Such a ternary nanoparticle formulation led to significant size reduction in comparison with binary nanoparticles, particularly at low N/P ratios (2 to 5). In HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes, and at low N/P ratios (2 to 5), transfection efficiency mediated by ternary nanoparticles prepared with 6.5% Gal-PPA was 6-7200 times higher than PPA-DPA/DNA nanoparticles. Transgene expression increased slightly at higher N/P ratios in HepG2 cells and reached a plateau at N/P ratios between 5 and 10 for primary rat hepatocytes. Such an enhancement effect was not observed in HeLa cells that lack of asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). Nevertheless, transfection efficiency of ternary particles decreased dramatically, presumably due to the decreased DNA binding capacity and particle stability, as PPA galactosylation degree increased. This highlights the importance of optimizing ligand conjugation degree for PPA gene carrier.",

        "Abstract": "Poly(propyl acrylic acid) (PPAA) is a polymer specifically designed to disrupt lipid bilayer membranes within a sharply defined pH range. The pH sensitivity can be used to enhance the release of endocytosed drugs into the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell. By incorporating this polymer in a polymeric gene carrier, chitosan, the release of plasmid DNA from the endosomal compartment was enhanced. In vitro transfection studies confirmed that the incorporation of PPAA into the chitosan-DNA nanoparticles enhanced gene expression in both HEK293 and HeLa cells compared to chitosan nanoparticles alone. The dose and time at which PPAA was incorporated during the complex formation affected the release of DNA and transfection efficiency. The optimal dose of PPAA incorporated into the chitosan nanoparticles was determined to be 10 microg, corresponding to a PPAA/DNA weight ratio of 1:1. At this dose, the ternary complexes are approx. 400 nm in size with a net negative surface charge of -17.4 mV. Intracellular trafficking studies confirmed the association of PPAA, DNA and chitosan at 24 h post-transfection and the subsequent release of DNA and PPAA from the chitosan at 48 h. The diffuse appearance of the majority of the DNA and the PPAA at later time points suggests that the PPAA triggered membrane disruption resulting in the release of DNA from the endosomal compartment. Finally, the lack of colocalization between PPAA and Lysotracker indicated that the PPAA-loaded nanoparticles were not trafficked through a lysosomal pathway. This study suggests the promising strategy of including PPAA in the formulation of polymer-DNA complexes for non-viral gene delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer represents one of the most efficient polymeric gene carriers. To investigate the effect of the core structure and generation of dendrimers on the complex formation and transfection efficiency, a series of PAMAM dendrimers with a trimesyl core (DT) at different generations (DT4 to DT8) were developed as gene carriers and compared with the PAMAM dendrimers derived from pentaerythritol (DP) and inositol (DI). The minimal generation number of DTs at which the dendrimer has enough amino group density to effectively condense DNA was higher (generation 6) than those of DPs and DIs (generation 5). DTs of generation 6 or higher condensed DNA into complexes with an average diameter ranging from 100 to 300 nm, but the 4th and 5th generations of DT (DT4 and DT5) formed only a severe aggregate with DNA. Interestingly, the DT6/pDNA complex was determined to be much smaller (100-300 nm) than those prepared with DP5 or DI5 (>600 nm) at N/P ratios higher than 15. The optimal generation numbers at which the dendrimers showed the highest transgene expression in COS-7 cells were 5 for DPs and DIs but 6 for DTs. The DT6/pDNAcomplex with smaller size mediated higher transgene expression in COS-7 cells than those prepared with DP5 or DI5. The in vitro transfection efficiency of the DT dendrimers as evaluated in HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and primary hepatocytes decreased in the order of DT6 > DT7 > DT8 > DT5 > DT4. The transfection mediated by DT6 was significantly inhibited by bafilomycin A1. The acid-base titration curve for DT6 showed high buffer capacity in the pH range from 5.5 to 6.4 (pK(a) approximately 6). This permits dendrimers to buffer the pH change in the endosomal compartment. However, the transfection efficiency mediated by DT6 decreased significantly in the presence of serum in both HeLa cells and COS-7 cells. The cytotoxicity of DTs evaluated in HeLa cells using the 3-{4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl}-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed a trend of increasing toxicity with the polymer generations. The LD50 values of DT4 through DT8 were 628, 236, 79, 82, and 77 microg/mL, respectively, which were higher than that of poly(ethyleneimide) (18 microg/mL) and poly(L-lysine) (28 microg/mL) in the same assay. With a lower cytotoxicity and versatility for chemical conjugation, these PAMAM dendrimers with a DT core warrant further investigation for nonviral gene delivery.",

        "Title": "Ternary complexes comprising polyphosphoramidate gene carriers with different types of charge groups improve transfection efficiency.",
        "Abstract": "To understand the influence of charge groups on transfection mediated by polymer complexes, we have synthesized a series of biodegradable and cationic polyphosphoramidates (PPAs) with an identical backbone but different side chains. Our previous study showed that PPA with a spermidine side chain (PPA-SP) showed high transfection efficiency in culture, whereas PPAs with secondary, tertiary, and quaternary amino groups were significantly less efficient. To investigate whether the coexistence of 1 degrees amino charge groups with 3 degrees and 2 degrees amino charge groups in the DNA/polymer complexes would enhance their transfection efficiency, we evaluated a ternary complex system containing DNA and PPAs with 1 degrees amino groups (PPA-SP) and 3 degrees amino groups (PPA-DMA) and a quaternary complex system containing DNA and PPAs with 1 degrees and 2 degrees and 3 degrees amino groups (PPA-EA/PPA-MEA/PPA-DMA), respectively. Ternary complexes mediated 20 and 160 times higher transfection efficiency in COS-7 cells than complexes of DNA with PPA-SP or PPA-DMA alone, respectively. Similarly, quaternary complexes exhibited 8-fold higher transfection efficiency than PPA-EA/DNA complexes. The mechanism of enhancement in transfection efficiency by the mixture carriers appears to be unrelated to the particle size, zeta potential, or DNA uptake. The titration characterization and the transfection experiments using a proton pump inhibitor suggest that the enhancement effect is unlikely due to the slightly improved buffering capacity of the mixture over PPA-SP. This approach represents a simple strategy of developing polymeric gene carriers and understanding the mechanisms of polymer-mediated gene transfer.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we describe a novel in vitro reconstitution system for tracheal epithelium that could be useful for investigating the cellular and molecular interaction of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. In this system, a Transwell insert was used as a basement membrane on which adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were cultured on the lower side whereas normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were cultured on the opposite upper side. Under air-liquid interface conditions, the epithelial cells maintained their capacity to progressively differentiate and form a functional epithelium, leading to the differentiation of mucin-producing cells between days 14 and 21. Analysis of apical secretions showed that mucin production increased over time, with peak secretion on day 21 for NHBE cells alone, whereas mucin secretion by NHBE cells cocultured with MSCs remained constant between days 18 and day 25. This in vitro model of respiratory epithelium, which exhibited morphologic, histologic, and functional features of a tracheal mucosa, could help to understand interactions between mesenchymal and epithelial cells and mechanisms involved in mucus production, inflammation, and airway repair. It might also play an important role in the design of an composite prosthesis for tracheal replacement.",

        "Abstract": "The concept of a \"biostructural unit\" is presented as the combination of biological and structural building blocks to create scaffolds or constructs via a bottom-up approach. Three types of biostructural units were constructed using the process of fiber formation by interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation: protein-encapsulated fiber, ligand-immobilized fiber, and cell-encapsulated fiber units. Water-soluble chitin (WSC) and alginate were used as the polyelectrolyte combination to form fiber. Encapsulation and sustained release of bovine serum albumin from the fiber could be achieved, release profiles being dependent on the WSC/alginate concentration ratio. Released nerve growth factor (NGF) retained its bioactivity, as demonstrated on PC12 cells. Biotinylated fiber could be fabricated by biotinylating alginate before drawing fiber with WSC, enabling biotinylated NGF to be immobilized to fiber via an avidin bridge. The immobilized NGF induced the differentiation of PC12 cells seeded on the fiber. Bovine pulmonary endothelial cells, human dermal fibroblasts, and human mesenchymal stem cells were encapsulated, demonstrating good viability as determined by Live/Dead and WST-1 assays. The assembly of biostructural units into constructs was illustrated by using human mesenchymal stem cell-encapsulated fiber units. Cells in the resulting constructs could be induced to differentiate along chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages.",

        "Abstract": "Polyelectrolyte complex films were prepared with polyethyleneoxide-maleic acid copolymer and chitosan using a casting/solvent evaporation method. The films were examined in terms of their IR spectra, surface and cross-section morphologies, cytotoxicity, and swelling behavior at different pH levels. To assess the potential of these films as a biomedical device, the profiles of the release of model drug from the CS/PEOMA films were examined at pH 4.8. The surface morphology of the films was quite smooth and uniform, and the cross-sectional morphology was dense and homogeneous. The swelling behaviors of CS/PEOMA films were found to depend on the pH of the solution as well as on the CS/PEOMA composition. Drug release from different CS/PEOMA films at pH 4.8 was found to be dependent on film composition. The results showed the potential applicability of CS/PEOMA film as a drug delivery vehicle.",

        "Abstract": "A new biodegradable polyphosphoester, poly[[(cholesteryl oxocarbonylamido ethyl) methyl bis(ethylene) ammonium iodide] ethyl phosphate] (PCEP) was synthesized and investigated for gene delivery. Carrying a positive charge in its backbone and a lipophilic cholesterol structure in the side chain, PCEP self-assembled into micelles in aqueous buffer at room temperature with an average size of 60-100 nm. It could bind and protect plasmid DNA from nuclease digestion. Cell proliferation assay indicated a lower cytotoxicity for PCEP than for poly-L-lysine and Lipofectamine. The IC50 determined by the WST-1 assay was 69.8, 51.6, and 12.1 microg/mL for PCEP, Lipofectamine, and poly-L-lysine, respectively. PCEP efficiently delivered DNA to several cell lines such as HEK293, Caco-2, and HeLa. The highest efficiency was achieved when PCEP/DNA complex was prepared in Opti-MEM with a +/- charge ratio of 1.5-2. The transfection efficiency did not change significantly when the complex was used 3 days after preparation. The addition of chloroquine to the formulation increased transfection efficiency 10- to 50-fold compared to the complex alone. In vivo studies showed a luciferase expression by PCEP/DNA complexes in muscle increasing with time during 3 months, although the expression level was lower than that by direct injection of naked DNA. In addition to biodegradability and lower toxicity, the PCEP micelle carrier offers structural versatility. The backbone charge density and the side chain lipophilicity are two parameters that can be varied through copolymerization and monomer variation to optimize the transfection efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Regenerative medicine requires scaffolds of divergent physicochemical properties for different tissue-engineering applications. To this end, a series of biodegradable poly(phosphoester) ionomers of the general composition [p(BHET-EOP-HOP/TC)] was synthesized, with BHET(bis-hydroxyl ethylene phosphate):EOP(ethylene phosphate):HOP(free phosphate) ratios of 60:20:20, 70:10:20, and 75:5:20, respectively. The 60/20/20 ionomer possessed the best tensile properties, exhibiting an average tensile modulus of 68 MPa and strain at break of 31%. Calcium treatment of the ionomer films led to significantly higher hardness and elastic moduli as measured by indentation. Calcium binding was evident from the increase in glass transition and melting temperatures, and a shift in the P-->O absorption in the FTIR spectrum. Stable N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS) of the ionomers could be synthesized to facilitate derivatization, as demonstrated by conjugation of GRGDS in this study. The polymers conjugated with NHS were hydrolyzed in a biphasic mode, with a fast initial phase occurring in the first few hours, followed by a slower phase in the next few days. These ionomers represent a novel class of biomaterials with readily controllable physical and chemical attributes for tissue engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Chitosans with various degrees of deacetylation were synthesized by acetylation with acetic anhydride. These chitosans were evaluated for efficacy of nanoparticle formation, DNA binding efficiency, morphology, and in vitro and in vivo gene transfection efficiency. DNA binding efficacy was reduced as degree of deacetylation was decreased, therefore requiring an increased +/-ratio to effect complete DNA complexation. For chitosan with a molecular weight of 390 kDa, the +/-ratio to achieve complete DNA complexation for degrees of deacetylation of 90%, 70% and 62% was 3.3:1, 5.0:1, and 9.0:1, respectively. The size and morphology of these nanoparticle formulations were not significantly different. The decreased degree of deacetylation results in a decrease in overall luciferase expression levels in HEK293, HeLa, and SW756 cells due to particle destabilization in the presence of serum proteins. However, intramuscular luciferase expression levels increased with decreasing deacetylation over the time points tested. Degree of chitosan deacetylation is an important factor in chitosan-DNA nanoparticle formulation as it affects DNA binding, release and gene transfection efficiency in vitro and in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "The efficacy of a drug delivery system is predicated on its retention in the target tissue. Microparticle is one of the most popular and effective drug delivery configurations. Recently, it has been shown that the interaction between drug-loaded microparticles and tissues is related to the effectiveness of paclitaxel delivery to the bladder wall of mice for treating superficial bladder cancer. In this study, the adhesive interaction between poly(methylidene malonate 2.12) or PMM 2.1.2 microparticles and collagen, which serves as the model extracellular matrix for bladder wall, was probed with confocal reflectance interference contrast microscopy (C-RICM), single-particle compressive force measurement and contact mechanics theory. Young's modulus of single PMM 2.1.2 microparticle was determined as 1.56 +/- 0.25 x 10(4)N/m(2). For plain PMM 2.1.2 microparticle in water (pH 5.5), the degree of deformation (a/R) on collagen coated substrate decreased from 0.77 to 0.26 against the increase of mid-plane diameter from 2 to 18 microm. The adhesion energy of PMM 2.1.2 microparticle was determined from Maguis-JKR theory and remained at around 1.5 mJ/m(2) against the increase of particle diameter. At pH 4, the average degree of particle deformation and adhesion energy was increased by 11% and 32%, respectively, in comparison with that at pH 5.5. The loading of paclitaxel in PMM 2.1.2 microspheres enhanced the deformation and adhesion of microspheres at pH 5.5. It is hypothesized that the electrostatic repulsion between paclitaxel and collagen at pH 4 reduces the adhesion energy of PMM 2.1.2-paclitaxel microsphere. This study may offer insight for design of future microparticulate delivery systems by providing the experimental and theoretical tools to study the bioadhesive interaction between drug-loaded microparticles and model extracellular matrices.",

PPE3 degraded rapidly in PBS 7.4 at 37 degrees C. The cytotoxicity and tissue compatibility assays suggested good biocompatibility of PPE3 in vitro and in vivo. The expression of pVR1255 Luc plasmid in mouse muscle after intramuscular (i.m.) injection of DNA formulated with PPE3 solution in saline was enhanced up to 4-fold compared with that of naked DNA. These results suggest the potential of this polyphosphoester for naked DNA-based gene therapy. The advantages of this polymer design include the biodegradability of the polyphosphoester and its structural versatility, which allows the fine-tuning of the physicochemical properties to optimize the enhancement of gene expression in muscle.",

        "Title": "A nonlinear hyperelastic mixture theory model for anisotropy, transport, and swelling of annulus fibrosus.",
        "Abstract": "A precise knowledge of the local mechanical and chemical environment around the nerve endings and disc cells in the annulus fibrosus will shed insight on understanding the mechanism of low-back pain and disc degeneration. It would also present an effective tool for the studies of the intervertebral disc structure-function relationship and provide guidance to disc tissue engineering. Experimental difficulties preclude the direct and simultaneous measurement of many of the important physical quantities, such as annulus pressurization, nutrient and electrolyte transport, and mechanical and swelling deformation. Considering that many of these quantities are coupled and that the annulus is highly anisotropic, interpretation of the results would be extremely challenging without an appropriate theoretical framework. In this study, we develop a nonlinear hyperelastic fiber-reinforced continuum mixture theory model for the annulus fibrosus. Special attention is given to the anisotropic nature of the annulus. On the basis of the lamella structure of annulus, and derived from a Helmholtz energy function, a locally transversely isotropic stress-strain relation is adopted for explicit representation of the collagen fiber orientations in general finite deformation situation. The exponential form of the Helmholtz energy function naturally reduces to the infinitesimal deformation form, and the equivalence between the current model coefficients and engineering elastic constants is established under the infinitesimal deformation. This model is able to describe the anisotropic finite and infinitesimal deformation, tension-compression nonlinearity, osmotic swelling, pressurization, electrical potential and current, and water and ion transports as well as the electroneutral nutrient (or growth factor) transport within the annulus.",

        "Abstract": "Tiny tubes with fiber architecture were developed by a novel method of fabrication upon introducing some modification to the microbraiding technique, to function as nerve guide conduit and the feasibility of in vivo nerve regeneration was investigated through several of these conduits. Poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (10:90) polymer fibers being biocompatible and biodegradable were used for the fabrication of the conduits. The microbraided nerve guide conduits (MNGCs) were characterized using scanning electron microscopy to study the surface morphology and fiber arrangement. Degradation tests were performed and the micrographs of the conduit showed that the degradation of the conduit is by fiber breakage indicating bulk hydrolysis of the polymer. Biological performances of the conduits were examined in the rat sciatic nerve model with a 12-mm gap. After implantation of the MNGC to the right sciatic nerve of the rat, there was no inflammatory response. One week after implantation, a thin tissue capsule was formed on the outer surface of the conduit, indicating good biological response of the conduit. Fibrin matrix cable formation was seen inside the MNGC after 1 week implantation. One month after implantation, 9 of 10 rats showed successful nerve regeneration. None of the implanted tubes showed tube breakage. The MNGCs were flexible, permeable, and showed no swelling apart from its other advantages. Thus, these new poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) microbraided conduits can be effective aids for nerve regeneration and repair and may lead to clinical applications.",

        "Abstract": "Cholesteryl end-capped thermally responsive amphiphilic polymers with two different hydrophobic/hydrophilic chain-length ratios were synthesized from the hydroxyl-terminated random poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N,N-dimethylacrylamide) and cholesteryl chloroformate. The hydroxyl-terminated precursor polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions were synthesized by free-radical polymerization using 2-hydroxyethanethiol as a chain-transfer agent. The aqueous solutions of the cholesteryl end-capped copolymers exhibited reversible phase transitions at temperatures slightly above human body temperature, with the lower critical solution temperature values being 37.7 and 38.2 degrees C, respectively. The critical micelle concentration values of the two cholesteryl end-capped polymers were 9 and 25 mg/L, respectively. Polymeric micellar nanoparticles were prepared from the amphiphilic polymers using a dialysis method as well as a direct dissolution method. Transmission electron microscope studies showed that the micellar nanoparticles existed in different morphologies, including spherical, star-like, and cuboid shapes. Pyrene as a model hydrophobic compound could be readily encapsulated in these polymeric nanoparticles, at loading levels of 1.0 and 0.8 mg/g for the two cholesteryl end-capped polymers, respectively. The temperature sensitivity and unusual morphology of these novel polymeric nanoparticles would make an interesting drug delivery system.",

        "Abstract": "Cationic polyphosphoesters (PPEs) with different side-chain charge groups were designed and synthesized as biodegradable gene carriers. Poly(N-methyl-2-aminoethyl propylene phosphate) (PPE-MEA), with a secondary amino group (-CH(2)CH(2)NHCH3) side chain released DNA in several hours at N/P (amino group of polymer to phosphate group of DNA) ratios from 0.5 to 5; whereas PPE-HA, bearing -CH(2)(CH2)(4)CH(2)NH(2) groups in the side chain, did not release DNA at the same ratio range for 30 days. Hydrolytic degradation and DNA binding results suggested that side chain cleavage, besides the polymer degradation, was the predominant factor affected the DNA release and transfection efficiencies. The side chain of PPE-MEA was cleaved faster than that of PPE-HA, resulting poor cellular uptake and no transgene expression for PPE-MEA/DNA complexes in COS-7 cells at charge ratios from 4 to 12. In contrast, PPE-HA/DNA complexes were stable enough to be internalized by cells and effected gene transfection (3400 folds higher than background at a charge ratio of 12). Interestingly, gene expression levels mediated by PPE-MEA and PPE-HA in mouse muscle following intramuscular injection of complexes showed a reversed order: PPE-MEA/DNA complexes mediated a 1.5-2-fold higher luciferase expression in mouse muscle as compared with naked DNA injection, while PPE-HA/DNA complexes induced delayed and lowered luciferase expression than naked DNA. These results suggested that the side chain structure is a crucial factor determining the mechanism and kinetics of hydrolytic degradation of PPE carriers, which in turn influenced the kinetics of DNA release from PPE/DNA complexes and their transfection abilities in vitro and in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Many biodegradable polymers have been developed for controlled drug delivery. The plethora of drug therapies and types of drugs demand different formulations, fabrications conditions and release kinetics. No one single polymer can satisfy all the requirements. To extend the properties of poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA), we synthesized copolymers of PLA and poly(ethylethylene phosphate) (PEEP) by ring-opening polymerization using Al(Oipr)3 as the initiator. The copolymers were structurally characterized by IR and 1H NMR. DSC data confirmed the formation of random microphase structure in all the copolymers, and showed a decrease of Tg from 43.2 to -22.6 degrees C when the molar content of ethylethylene phosphate (EEP) increased from 5 to 40%. The hydrophilicity of the copolymers increased with EEP content. In contrast to the degradation behavior of PLA, disc samples made of PLAEEP90 showed a linear weight loss profile in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. BSA microspheres using PLAEEP90 were prepared by double-emulsion method, yielding a loading level of 4.3% and a loading efficiency of 75%. The BSA release profile consisted of an initial burst (9%) on the first day, followed by a daily 4% release for the following 40 days, resulting in 91% of the BSA release in a near linear manner. The released BSA remained intact according to SDS-PAGE data. Cytotoxicity and histopathology studies showed low toxicity in HeLa cells and good tissue biocompatibility in mouse brain, respectively. PLAEEP is a promising biodegradable polymer for controlled drug delivery.",

        "Abstract": "The goal of gene therapy is to introduce foreign genes into somatic cells to supplement defective genes or provide additional biological functions, and can be achieved using either viral or synthetic non-viral delivery systems. Compared with viral vectors, synthetic gene-delivery systems, such as liposomes and polymers, offer several advantages including ease of production and reduced risk of cytotoxicity and immunogenicity, but their use has been limited by the relatively low transfection efficiency. This problem mainly stems from the difficulty in controlling their properties at the nanoscale. Synthetic inorganic gene carriers have received limited attention in the gene-therapy community, the only notable example being gold nanoparticles with surface-immobilized DNA applied to intradermal genetic immunization by particle bombardment. Here we present a non-viral gene-delivery system based on multisegment bimetallic nanorods that can simultaneously bind compacted DNA plasmids and targeting ligands in a spatially defined manner. This approach allows precise control of composition, size and multifunctionality of the gene-delivery system. Transfection experiments performed in vitro and in vivo provide promising results that suggest potential in genetic vaccination applications.",

        "Title": "Injectable drug-delivery systems based on supramolecular hydrogels formed by poly(ethylene oxide)s and alpha-cyclodextrin.",
        "Abstract": "Polymeric hydrogels long have attracted interest for biomaterials applications because of their generally favorable biocompatibility. High in water content, they are particularly attractive for delivery of delicate bioactive agents, such as proteins. However, because they require covalent crosslinking for gelation, many hydrogels can be applied only as implantables, and incorporation of drugs by sorption may be time-consuming and limiting with regard to the loading level. Therefore a delivery formulation where gelation and drug loading can be achieved simultaneously, taking place in an aqueous environment and without covalent crosslinking, would be attractive. Herein is described a new class of injectable and bioabsorbable supramolecular hydrogels formed from poly(ethylene oxide)s (PEOs) and alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) for controlled drug delivery. The hydrogel formation is based on physical crosslinking induced by supramolecular self-assembling with no chemical crosslinking reagent involved. The supramolecular structure of the hydrogels was confirmed with wide-angle X-ray diffraction studies. The gelation kinetics was found to be dependent on the concentrations of the polymer and alpha-CD as well as on the molecular weight of the PEO used. The rheologic studies of the hydrogels showed that the hydrogels were thixotropic and reversible and that they could be injected through fine needles. The components of the supramolecular hydrogels potentially are biocompatible and nontoxic. Drugs can be encapsulated directly into the hydrogels in situ at room temperature without any contact with organic solvents. The supramolecular hydrogels were evaluated in terms of their in vitro release kinetics. The rate-controlling mechanism of macromolecular drug release might be the erosion of the hydrogels.",

        "Abstract": "Polymers with repeating phosphoester bonds in the backbone are structurally versatile, and biodegradable through hydrolysis, and possibly enzymatic digestion at the phosphoester linkages under physiological conditions. These biodegradable polyphosphoesters are appealing for biological and pharmaceutical applications because of their potential biocompatibility and similarity to bio-macromolecules such as nucleic acids. In the first part of this review, we will focus on one particular structure synthesized by extending oligomeric lactide prepolymers with ethylphosphate groups. This amorphous to semi-crystalline polymer is promising in delivering anti-cancer therapeutics in the form of microspheres. In the second half, we will discuss the conjugation of charged groups to the side chain of the phosphate, constituting one of the few biodegradable cationic polymers in the field for non-viral gene delivery. Capable of delivering exogenous genes to a cell nucleus or providing an extracellular sustained release of DNA, these cationic polyphosphoesters also serve as a valuable model to understand the important characteristics that render a polymer an effective gene carrier.",

        "Title": "Preparation and characterization of polypseudorotaxanes based on block-selected inclusion complexation between poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide) triblock copolymers and alpha-cyclodextrin.",
        "Abstract": "A series of new polypseudorotaxanes were synthesized in high yields when the middle poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) block of poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide) (PPO-PEO-PPO) triblock copolymers was selectively recognized and included by alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) to form crystalline inclusion complexes (ICs), although the middle PEO block was flanked by two thicker PPO blocks, and a PPO chain had been previously thought to be impenetrable to alpha-CD. X-ray diffraction studies demonstrated that the IC domains of the polypseudorotaxanes assumed a channel-type structure similar to the necklace-like ICs formed by alpha-CD and PEO homopolymers. Solid-state CP/MAS (13)C NMR studies showed that the alpha-CD molecules in the polypseudorotaxanes adopted a symmetrical conformation due to the formation of ICs. The compositions and stoichiometry of the polypseudorotaxanes were studied using (1)H NMR, and a 2:1 (ethylene oxide unit to alpha-CD) stoichiometry was found for all polypseudorotaxanes although the PPO-PEO-PPO triblock copolymers had different compositions and block lengths, suggesting that only the PEO block was closely included by alpha-CD molecules, whereas the PPO blocks were uncovered. The hypothesis was further supported by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies of the polypseudorotaxanes. The glass transitions of the PPO blocks in the polypseudorotaxanes were clearly observed because they were uncovered by alpha-CD and remained amorphous, whereas the glass-transition temperatures increased, because the molecular motion of the PPO blocks was restricted by the hard crystalline phases of the IC domains formed by alpha-CD and the PEO blocks. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the polypseudorotaxanes had better thermal stability than their free components due to the inclusion complexation. Finally, the kinetics of the threading process of alpha-CD onto the copolymers was also studied. The findings reported in this article suggested interesting possibilities in designing other cyclodextrin ICs and polypseudorotaxanes with block structures.",

        "Abstract": "A new cationic polymer (PPA-SP), polyphosphoramidate bearing spermidine side chain, was prepared as a non-viral vector for gene delivery. PPA-SP was synthesized from poly(1,2-propylene H-phosphonate) by the Atherton-Todd reaction. The weight average molecular weight of PPA-SP was 3.44x10(4) with a number average degree of polymerization of 90, as determined by GPC/LS/RI method. The average net positive charge per polymer chain was 102. PPA-SP was able to condense plasmid DNA efficiently and formed complexes at an N/P ratio (free amino groups in polymer to phosphate groups in DNA) of 2 and above, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. This new gene carrier offered significant protection to DNA against nuclease degradation at N/P ratios above 2, and showed lower cytotoxicity than PLL and PEI in cell culture. The LD(50) of PPA-SP was 85 microg/ml in COS-7 cells, in contrast to 20 and 42 microg/ml for PLL and PEI, respectively. The complexes prepared in saline at N/P ratios of 5 approximately 10 had an average size of 250 nm and zeta-potential of 26 mV. PPA-SP mediated efficient gene transfection in a number of cell lines, and the transfection protocol was optimized in HEK293 cells using a luciferase plasmid as a marker gene. Gene expression mediated by PPA-SP was greatly enhanced when chloroquine was used in conjunction at a concentration of 100 microM. Under the optimized condition, PPA-SP/DNA complexes yield a luciferase expression level closed to PEI/DNA complexes or Transfast mediated transfection. In a non-invasive CNS gene delivery model, PPA-SP/DNA complexes yielded comparable bcl-2 expression as PEI/DNA complexes in mouse brain stem following injection of the complexes in the tongue.",
