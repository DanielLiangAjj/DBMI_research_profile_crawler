        "Abstract": "Activation of p53 by the small molecule Nutlin can result in a combination of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The relative strength of these events is difficult to predict by classical gene expression analysis, leaving uncertainty as to the therapeutic benefits. In this study, we report a translational control mechanism shaping p53-dependent apoptosis. Using polysome profiling, we establish Nutlin-induced apoptosis to associate with the enhanced translation of mRNAs carrying multiple copies of an identified 3' UTR CG-rich motif mediating p53-dependent death (CGPD-motif). We identify PCBP2 and DHX30 as CGPD-motif interactors. We find that in cells undergoing persistent cell cycle arrest in response to Nutlin, CGPD-motif mRNAs are repressed by the PCBP2-dependent binding of DHX30 to the motif. Upon DHX30 depletion in these cells, the translation of CGPD-motif mRNAs increases, and the response to Nutlin shifts toward apoptosis. Instead, DHX30 inducible overexpression in SJSA1 cells leads to decreased translation of CGPD-motif mRNAs.",

        "Abstract": "The p53 and NFÎºB sequence-specific transcription factors play crucial roles in cell proliferation and survival with critical, even if typically opposite, effects on cancer progression. To investigate a possible crosstalk between p53 and NFÎºB driven by chemotherapy-induced responses in the context of an inflammatory microenvironment, we performed a proof of concept study using MCF7 cells. Transcriptome analyses upon single or combined treatments with doxorubicin (Doxo, 1.5Î¼M) and the NFÎºB inducer TNF-alpha (TNFÎ±, 5ng/ml) revealed 432 up-regulated (log2 FC> 2), and 390 repressed genes (log2 FC< -2) for the Doxo+TNFÎ± treatment. 239 up-regulated and 161 repressed genes were synergistically regulated by the double treatment. Annotation and pathway analyses of Doxo+TNFÎ± selectively up-regulated genes indicated strong enrichment for cell migration terms. A panel of genes was examined by qPCR coupled to p53 activation by Doxo, 5-Fluoruracil and Nutlin-3a, or to p53 or NFÎºB inhibition. Transcriptome data were confirmed for 12 of 15 selected genes and seven (PLK3, LAMP3, ETV7, UNC5B, NTN1, DUSP5, SNAI1) were synergistically up-regulated after Doxo+TNFÎ± and dependent both on p53 and NFÎºB. Migration assays consistently showed an increase in motility for MCF7 cells upon Doxo+TNFÎ±. A signature of 29 Doxo+TNFÎ± highly synergistic genes exhibited prognostic value for luminal breast cancer patients, with adverse outcome correlating with higher relative expression. We propose that the crosstalk between p53 and NFÎºB can lead to the activation of specific gene expression programs that may impact on cancer phenotypes and potentially modify the efficacy of cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "DNA integrity in blood is an emerging biomarker in cancer. Here we report a real time PCR approach for the absolute quantification of four amplicons of 67, 180, 306 and 476 bp in cutaneous melanoma. Three different integrity indexes (180/67, 306/67 and 476/67 ratios) were tested for their ability to reflect differences in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentation in 79 patients affected by cutaneous melanoma and 34 healthy subjects. All the three integrity indexes showed higher values in melanoma patients in comparison with healthy subjects. According to ROC curve analysis, the ratio 180/67 is the most suitable index to be used in cancer patient selection, even if the combination of the 3 indexes gives the best performance in terms of clinical sensitivity. The most represented fragments in plasma of melanoma patients are those comprised between 181 and 307 bp, while in healthy subjects there is a prevalence of shorter fragments (67-180 bp). In conclusion, DNA integrity indexes can be considered suitable parameters for monitoring cfDNA fragmentation in melanoma patients.",
