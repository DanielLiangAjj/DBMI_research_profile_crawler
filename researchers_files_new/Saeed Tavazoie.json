We present a systematic analysis of the prognostic potential of diverse molecular features across large cancer cohorts. We find that the mRNA expression of biologically coherent sets of genes (modules) is substantially more predictive of patient survival than single-locus genomic and transcriptomic aberrations. Extending our analysis beyond existing curated gene modules, we find a large novel class of highly prognostic DNA/RNA ",

        "Abstract": "Thymidine starvation causes rapid cell death. This enigmatic process known as thymineless death (TLD) is the underlying killing mechanism of diverse antimicrobial and antineoplastic drugs. Despite decades of investigation, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of the causal sequence of events that culminate in TLD. Here, we used a diverse set of unbiased approaches to systematically determine the genetic and regulatory underpinnings of TLD in Escherichia coli. In addition to discovering novel genes in previously implicated pathways, our studies revealed a critical and previously unknown role for intracellular acidification in TLD. We observed that a decrease in cytoplasmic pH is a robust early event in TLD across different genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, we show that acidification is a causal event in the death process, as chemical and genetic perturbations that increase intracellular pH substantially reduce killing. We also observe a decrease in intracellular pH in response to exposure to the antibiotic gentamicin, suggesting that intracellular acidification may be a common mechanistic step in the bactericidal effects of other antibiotics.",

        "Abstract": "Free-living bacteria adapt to environmental change by reprogramming gene expression through precise interactions of hundreds of DNA-binding proteins. A predictive understanding of bacterial physiology requires us to globally monitor all such protein-DNA interactions across a range of environmental and genetic perturbations. Here, we show that such global observations are possible using an optimized version of in vivo protein occupancy display technology (in vivo protein occupancy display-high resolution, IPOD-HR) and present a pilot application to Escherichia coli. We observe that the E. coli protein-DNA interactome organizes into 2 distinct prototypic features: (1) highly dynamic condition-dependent transcription factor (TF) occupancy; and (2) robust kilobase scale occupancy by nucleoid factors, forming silencing domains analogous to eukaryotic heterochromatin. We show that occupancy dynamics across a range of conditions can rapidly reveal the global transcriptional regulatory organization of a bacterium. Beyond discovery of previously hidden regulatory logic, we show that these observations can be utilized to computationally determine sequence specificity models for the majority of active TFs. Our study demonstrates that global observations of protein occupancy combined with statistical inference can rapidly and systematically reveal the transcriptional regulatory and structural features of a bacterial genome. This capacity is particularly crucial for non-model bacteria that are not amenable to routine genetic manipulation.",

The comprehensive nature of the library also revealed refined spacer design parameters for transcriptional repression, including location, nucleosome occupancy and nucleotide features.

        "Abstract": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been the subject of many studies aimed at understanding mechanisms of adaptation to environmental stresses. Most of these studies have focused on adaptation to sub-lethal stresses, upon which a stereotypic transcriptional program called the environmental stress response (ESR) is activated. However, the genetic and regulatory factors that underlie the adaptation and survival of yeast cells to stresses that cross the lethality threshold have not been systematically studied. Here, we utilized a combination of gene expression profiling, deletion-library fitness profiling, and experimental evolution to systematically explore adaptation of S. cerevisiae to acute exposure to threshold lethal ethanol concentrations-a stress with important biotechnological implications. We found that yeast cells activate a rapid transcriptional reprogramming process that is likely adaptive in terms of post-stress survival. We also utilized repeated cycles of lethal ethanol exposure to evolve yeast strains with substantially higher ethanol tolerance and survival. Importantly, these strains displayed bulk growth-rates that were indistinguishable from the parental wild-type strain. Remarkably, these hyper-ethanol tolerant strains had reprogrammed their pre-stress gene expression states to match the likely adaptive post-stress response in the wild-type strain. Our studies reveal critical determinants of yeast survival to lethal ethanol stress and highlight potentially general principles that may underlie evolutionary adaptation to lethal stresses in general.",

However, guide RNA libraries are costly to synthesize, and their limited diversity compromises the sensitivity of CRISPR screens. Using the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-Cas adaptation machinery, we developed CRISPR adaptation-mediated library manufacturing (CALM), which turns bacterial cells into \"factories\" for generating hundreds of thousands of crRNAs covering 95% of all targetable genomic sites. With an average gene targeted by more than 100 distinct crRNAs, these highly comprehensive CRISPRi libraries produced varying degrees of transcriptional repression critical for uncovering novel antibiotic resistance determinants. Furthermore, by iterating CRISPR adaptation, we rapidly generated dual-crRNA libraries representing more than 100,000 dual-gene perturbations. The polarized nature of spacer adaptation revealed the historical contingency in the stepwise acquisition of genetic perturbations leading to increasing antibiotic resistance. CALM circumvents the expense, labor, and time required for synthesis and cloning of gRNAs, allowing generation of CRISPRi libraries in wild-type bacteria refractory to routine genetic manipulation.",

Indeed, the isolation of bacteria with substantially increased persistence rates from chronic infections suggests that evolution of hyperpersistence is a significant factor in clinical therapy resistance. However, the pathways that lead to hyperpersistence and the underlying cellular states have yet to be systematically studied. Here, we show that laboratory evolution can lead to increase in persistence rates by orders of magnitude for multiple independently evolved populations of ",

        "Title": "Unconventional function of an Achaete-Scute homolog as a terminal selector of nociceptive neuron identity.",
        "Abstract": "Proneural genes are among the most early-acting genes in nervous system development, instructing blast cells to commit to a neuronal fate. Drosophila Atonal and Achaete-Scute complex (AS-C) genes, as well as their vertebrate orthologs, are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with such proneural activity. We show here that a C. elegans AS-C homolog, hlh-4, functions in a fundamentally different manner. In the embryonic, larval, and adult nervous systems, hlh-4 is expressed exclusively in a single nociceptive neuron class, ADL, and its expression in ADL is maintained via transcriptional autoregulation throughout the life of the animal. However, in hlh-4 null mutants, the ADL neuron is generated and still appears neuronal in overall morphology and expression of panneuronal and pansensory features. Rather than acting as a proneural gene, we find that hlh-4 is required for the ADL neuron to function properly, to adopt its correct morphology, to express its unusually large repertoire of olfactory receptor-encoding genes, and to express other known features of terminal ADL identity, including neurotransmitter phenotype, neuropeptides, ion channels, and electrical synapse proteins. hlh-4 is sufficient to induce ADL identity features upon ectopic expression in other neuron types. The expression of ADL terminal identity features is directly controlled by HLH-4 via a phylogenetically conserved E-box motif, which, through bioinformatic analysis, we find to constitute a predictive feature of ADL-expressed terminal identity markers. The lineage that produces the ADL neuron was previously shown to require the conventional, transient proneural activity of another AS-C homolog, hlh-14, demonstrating sequential activities of distinct AS-C-type bHLH genes in neuronal specification. Taken together, we have defined here an unconventional function of an AS-C-type bHLH gene as a terminal selector of neuronal identity and we speculate that such function could be reflective of an ancestral function of an \"ur-\" bHLH gene.",

Here, using a two-species system, we studied the antagonism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against Escherichia coli. Our unbiased genome-scale approach enabled us to identify multiple factors that explained the entire antagonism observed. We discovered both forms of ecological competition-sequestration of iron led to exploitative competition, while phenazine exposure engendered interference competition. We used laboratory evolution to discover adaptive evolutionary trajectories in our system. In the presence of P. aeruginosa toxins, E. coli populations showed parallel molecular evolution and adaptive convergence at the gene-level. The multiple resistance pathways discovered provide novel insights into mechanisms of toxin entry and activity. Our study reveals the molecular complexity of a simple two-species interaction, an important first-step in the application of systems biology to detailed molecular dissection of interactions within native microbiomes.",

We used a bidirectional reporter system coupled with flow cytometry and high-throughput sequencing to measure the effect of short, noncoding, vertebrate-conserved RNA sequences on transcript stability and translation. Information-theoretic motif analysis of the resulting sequence-to-gene-expression mapping revealed linear and structural RNA cis-regulatory elements that positively and negatively modulate the posttranscriptional fates of human transcripts. This combined experimental/computational strategy can be used to systematically characterize the vast landscape of posttranscriptional regulatory elements controlling physiological and pathological cellular state transitions.",

A prerequisite for any practical application of this phenotypic diversity is knowledge of the genetic determinants for each trait of interest. Sequence divergence between strains is often so extensive as to make brute-force approaches to identifying the loci contributing to a given trait impractical. Here we describe a global linkage analysis approach, GLINT, for rapid discovery of the causal genetic variants underlying phenotypic divergence between distantly related strains of Escherichia coli. This general strategy will also be usable, with minor modifications, for revealing genotype-phenotype associations between naturally occurring strains of other bacterial species.",

A logical elaboration of this idea leads to a dynamical neural architecture that oscillates between two fundamental network states, one driven by external input, and the other by recurrent synaptic drive in the absence of sensory input. Synaptic strength is modified by a proposed synaptic state matching (SSM) process that ensures equivalence of spike statistics between the two network states. Remarkably, SSM, operating locally at individual synapses, generates accurate and stable network-level predictive internal representations, enabling pattern completion and unsupervised feature detection from noisy sensory input. SSM is a biologically plausible substrate for learning and memory because it brings together sequence learning, feature detection, synaptic homeostasis, and network oscillations under a single unifying computational framework.",

        "Abstract": "The metabolic capabilities and regulatory networks of bacteria have been optimized by evolution in response to selective pressures present in each species' native ecological niche. In a new environment, however, the same bacteria may grow poorly due to regulatory constraints or biochemical deficiencies. Adaptation to such conditions can proceed through the acquisition of new cellular functionality due to gain of function mutations or via modulation of cellular networks. Using selection experiments on transposon-mutagenized libraries of bacteria, we illustrate that even under conditions of extreme nutrient limitation, substantial adaptation can be achieved solely through loss of function mutations, which rewire the metabolism of the cell without gain of enzymatic or sensory function. A systematic analysis of similar experiments under more than 100 conditions reveals that adaptive loss of function mutations exist for many environmental challenges. Drawing on a wealth of examples from published articles, we detail the range of mechanisms through which loss-of-function mutations can generate such beneficial regulatory changes, without the need for rare, specific mutations to fine-tune enzymatic activities or network connections. The high rate at which loss-of-function mutations occur suggests that null mutations play an underappreciated role in the early stages of adaption of bacterial populations to new environments.",

        "Abstract": "Phenotypic heterogeneity displayed by a clonal bacterial population permits a small fraction of cells to survive prolonged exposure to antibiotics. Although first described over 60 y ago, the molecular mechanisms underlying this behavior, termed persistence, remain largely unknown. To systematically explore the genetic basis of persistence, we selected a library of transposon-mutagenized Escherichia coli cells for survival to multiple rounds of lethal ampicillin exposure. Application of microarray-based genetic footprinting revealed a large number of loci that drastically elevate persistence frequency through null mutations and domain disruptions. In one case, the C-terminal disruption of methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetG) results in a 10,000-fold higher persistence frequency than wild type. We discovered a mechanism by which null mutations in transketolase A (tktA) and glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) dehydrogenase (glpD) increase persistence through metabolic flux alterations that increase intracellular levels of the growth-inhibitory metabolite methylglyoxal. Systematic double-mutant analyses revealed the genetic network context in which such persistent mutants function. Our findings reveal a large mutational target size for increasing persistence frequency, which has fundamental implications for the emergence of antibiotic tolerance in the clinical setting.",

        "Abstract": "Regulatory networks allow organisms to match adaptive behavior to the complex and dynamic contingencies of their native habitats. Upon a sudden transition to a novel environment, the mismatch between the native behavior and the new niche provides selective pressure for adaptive evolution through mutations in elements that control gene expression. In the case of core components of cellular regulation and metabolism, with broad control over diverse biological processes, such mutations may have substantial pleiotropic consequences. Through extensive phenotypic analyses, we have characterized the systems-level consequences of one such mutation (rho*) in the global transcriptional terminator Rho of Escherichia coli. We find that a single amino acid change in Rho results in a massive change in the fitness landscape of the cell, with widely discrepant fitness consequences of identical single locus perturbations in rho* versus rho(WT) backgrounds. Our observations reveal the extent to which a single regulatory mutation can transform the entire fitness landscape of the cell, causing a massive change in the interpretation of individual mutations and altering the evolutionary trajectories which may be accessible to a bacterial population.",

        "Abstract": "Microbial regulatory strategies have long been understood in terms of the homeostatic framework, in which a response is interpreted as a restoring force counteracting the immediate intracellular consequences of a change in the environment. In this review, we summarize the breadth of recent discoveries of cellular behavior extending beyond the homeostatic framework. We argue that the nonrandom structure of native habitats makes environmental fluctuations inherently multidimensional. Beyond its utility for accurate perception of immediate events, the temporal regularity of this multidimensional correlation structure allows microbes to make predictions about the trajectory of their sensory environment. We describe recently discovered examples of such predictive behavior, their physiological benefits, and the underlying evolutionary forces shaping them. These observations compel us to go beyond homeostasis and consider a predictive-dynamic framework in which cellular behavior is orchestrated in response to the meaning of an environmental perturbation, not only its direct and immediate fitness consequences.",

        "Title": "Systematic discovery of structural elements governing stability of mammalian messenger RNAs.",
        "Abstract": "Decoding post-transcriptional regulatory programs in RNA is a critical step towards the larger goal of developing predictive dynamical models of cellular behaviour. Despite recent efforts, the vast landscape of RNA regulatory elements remains largely uncharacterized. A long-standing obstacle is the contribution of local RNA secondary structure to the definition of interaction partners in a variety of regulatory contexts, including--but not limited to--transcript stability, alternative splicing and localization. There are many documented instances where the presence of a structural regulatory element dictates alternative splicing patterns (for example, human cardiac troponin T) or affects other aspects of RNA biology. Thus, a full characterization of post-transcriptional regulatory programs requires capturing information provided by both local secondary structures and the underlying sequence. Here we present a computational framework based on context-free grammars and mutual information that systematically explores the immense space of small structural elements and reveals motifs that are significantly informative of genome-wide measurements of RNA behaviour. By applying this framework to genome-wide human mRNA stability data, we reveal eight highly significant elements with substantial structural information, for the strongest of which we show a major role in global mRNA regulation. Through biochemistry, mass spectrometry and in vivo binding studies, we identified human HNRPA2B1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1, also known as HNRNPA2B1) as the key regulator that binds this element and stabilizes a large number of its target genes. We created a global post-transcriptional regulatory map based on the identity of the discovered linear and structural cis-regulatory elements, their regulatory interactions and their target pathways. This approach could also be used to reveal the structural elements that modulate other aspects of RNA behaviour.",

A major outstanding question is the degree to which the biofilm-specific cellular state and its constituent genetic determinants contribute to this hyper-tolerant phenotype. Here, we used genome-wide functional profiling of a complex, heterogeneous mutant population of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPAO1 in biofilm and planktonic growth conditions with and without tobramycin to systematically quantify the contribution of each locus to antibiotic tolerance under these two states. We identified large sets of mutations that contribute to antibiotic tolerance predominantly in the biofilm or planktonic setting only, offering global insights into the differences and similarities between biofilm and planktonic antibiotic tolerance. Our mixed population-based experimental design recapitulated the complexity of natural biofilms and, unlike previous studies, revealed clinically observed behaviors including the emergence of quorum sensing-deficient mutants. Our study revealed a substantial contribution of the cellular state to the antibiotic tolerance of biofilms, providing a rational foundation for the development of novel therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated infections.",

        "Abstract": "Successful strain engineering involves perturbing key nodes within the cellular network. How the -network's connectivity affects the phenotype of interest and the ideal nodes to modulate, however, are frequently not readily apparent. To guide the generation of a list of candidate nodes for detailed investigation, designers often examine the behavior of a representative set of strains, such as a library of transposon insertion mutants, in the environment of interest. Here, we first present design principles for creating a maximally informative competitive selection. Then, we describe how to globally quantify the change in distribution of strains within a transposon library in response to a competitive selection by amplifying the DNA adjacent to the transposons and hybridizing it to a microarray. Finally, we detail strategies for analyzing the resulting hybridization data to identify genes and pathways that contribute both negatively and positively to fitness in the desired environment.",

Here we show that short, linear protein motifs can be efficiently recovered from proteome-scale datasets such as sub-cellular localization, molecular function, half-life, and protein abundance data using an information theoretic approach. Using this approach, we have identified many known protein motifs, such as phosphorylation sites and localization signals, and discovered a large number of candidate elements. We estimate that ~80% of these are novel predictions in that they do not match a known motif in both sequence and biological context, suggesting that post-translational regulation of protein behavior is still largely unexplored. These predicted motifs, many of which display preferential association with specific biological pathways and non-random positioning in the linear protein sequence, provide focused hypotheses for experimental validation.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation is a central problem in biology. However, revealing the underlying molecular mechanisms has been challenging as changes in fitness may result from perturbations to many pathways, any of which may contribute relatively little. We have developed a combined experimental/computational framework to address this problem and used it to understand the genetic basis of ethanol tolerance in Escherichia coli. We used fitness profiling to measure the consequences of single-locus perturbations in the context of ethanol exposure. A module-level computational analysis was then used to reveal the organization of the contributing loci into cellular processes and regulatory pathways (e.g. osmoregulation and cell-wall biogenesis) whose modifications significantly affect ethanol tolerance. Strikingly, we discovered that a dominant component of adaptation involves metabolic rewiring that boosts intracellular ethanol degradation and assimilation. Through phenotypic and metabolomic analysis of laboratory-evolved ethanol-tolerant strains, we investigated naturally accessible pathways of ethanol tolerance. Remarkably, these laboratory-evolved strains, by and large, follow the same adaptive paths as inferred from our coarse-grained search of the fitness landscape.",

We show that such pathway perturbations, and the cis-regulatory elements through which they operate, can be efficiently extracted from global gene expression profiles. Our approach utilizes information-theoretic analysis of expression levels, pathways, and genomic sequences. Analysis across a diverse set of human cancers reveals the majority of previously known cancer pathways. Through de novo motif discovery we associate these pathways with transcription-factor binding sites and miRNA targets, including those of E2F, NF-Y, p53, and let-7. Follow-up experiments confirmed that these predictions correspond to functional in vivo regulatory interactions. Strikingly, the majority of the perturbations, associated with putative cis-regulatory elements, fall outside of known cancer pathways. Our study provides a systems-level dissection of regulatory perturbations in cancer-an essential component of a rational strategy for therapeutic intervention and drug-target discovery.",

We have developed in vivo protein occupancy display (IPOD), a technology that reveals protein occupancy across an entire bacterial chromosome at the resolution of individual binding sites. Application to Escherichia coli reveals thousands of protein occupancy peaks, highly enriched within and in close proximity to noncoding regulatory regions. In addition, we discovered extensive (>1 kilobase) protein occupancy domains (EPODs), some of which are localized to highly expressed genes, enriched in RNA-polymerase occupancy. However, the majority are localized to transcriptionally silent loci dominated by conserved hypothetical ORFs. These regions are highly enriched in both predicted and experimentally determined binding sites of nucleoid proteins and exhibit extreme biophysical characteristics such as high intrinsic curvature. Our observations implicate these transcriptionally silent EPODs as the elusive organizing centers, long proposed to topologically isolate chromosomal domains.",

However, developing effective strategies for controlling biofilms requires an understanding of the underlying biology well beyond what currently exists. Using a novel strategy, we have induced formation of a robust biofilm in Escherichia coli by utilizing an exogenous source of poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) polymer, a major virulence factor of many pathogens. Through microarray profiling of competitive selections, carried out in both transposon insertion and over-expression libraries, we have revealed the genetic basis of PNAG-based biofilm formation. Our observations reveal the dominance of electrostatic interactions between PNAG and surface structures such as lipopolysaccharides. We show that regulatory modulation of these surface structures has significant impact on biofilm formation behavior of the cell. Furthermore, the majority of clinical isolates which produced PNAG also showed the capacity to respond to the exogenously produced version of the polymer.",

        "Abstract": "The homeostatic framework has dominated our understanding of cellular physiology. We question whether homeostasis alone adequately explains microbial responses to environmental stimuli, and explore the capacity of intracellular networks for predictive behavior in a fashion similar to metazoan nervous systems. We show that in silico biochemical networks, evolving randomly under precisely defined complex habitats, capture the dynamical, multidimensional structure of diverse environments by forming internal representations that allow prediction of environmental change. We provide evidence for such anticipatory behavior by revealing striking correlations of Escherichia coli transcriptional responses to temperature and oxygen perturbations-precisely mirroring the covariation of these parameters upon transitions between the outside world and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. We further show that these internal correlations reflect a true associative learning paradigm, because they show rapid decoupling upon exposure to novel environments.",

Fastcompare is based on the network-level conservation principle, according to which the connectivity of transcriptional regulatory networks should be largely conserved between two closely related genomes. We describe here the procedure for applying Fastcompare to large genomes (with an emphasis on metazoan genomes), including scoring of exhaustive motif lists, determination of conservation threshold using sequence randomizations, and discovery of interactions between regulatory elements.",

        "Abstract": "Deciphering the noncoding regulatory genome has proved a formidable challenge. Despite the wealth of available gene expression data, there currently exists no broadly applicable method for characterizing the regulatory elements that shape the rich underlying dynamics. We present a general framework for detecting such regulatory DNA and RNA motifs that relies on directly assessing the mutual information between sequence and gene expression measurements. Our approach makes minimal assumptions about the background sequence model and the mechanisms by which elements affect gene expression. This provides a versatile motif discovery framework, across all data types and genomes, with exceptional sensitivity and near-zero false-positive rates. Applications from yeast to human uncover putative and established transcription-factor binding and miRNA target sites, revealing rich diversity in their spatial configurations, pervasive co-occurrences of DNA and RNA motifs, context-dependent selection for motif avoidance, and the strong impact of posttranscriptional processes on eukaryotic transcriptomes.",

Application of this method to Escherichia coli motility identifies 95% of the known flagellar and chemotaxis genes, and reveals three dozen novel loci that, to varying degrees and through diverse mechanisms, affect motility. To probe the network context in which these genes function, we developed a method that uncovers genome-wide epistatic interactions through comprehensive analyses of double-mutant phenotypes. This allows us to place the novel genes within the context of signaling and regulatory networks, including the Rcs phosphorelay pathway and the cyclic di-GMP second-messenger system. This unifying framework enables sensitive and comprehensive genetic characterization of complex behaviors across the microbial biosphere.",

        "Abstract": "During the maternal-to-zygotic transition, a developing embryo integrates post-transcriptional regulation of maternal mRNAs with transcriptional activation of its own genome. By combining chromosomal ablation in Drosophila with microarray analysis, we characterized the basis of this integration. We show that the expression profile for at least one third of zygotically active genes is coupled to the concomitant degradation of the corresponding maternal mRNAs. The embryo uses transcription and degradation to generate localized patterns of expression, and zygotic transcription to degrade distinct classes of maternal transcripts. Although degradation does not appear to involve a simple regulatory code, the activation of the zygotic genome starts from intronless genes sharing a common cis-element. This cis-element interacts with a single protein, the Bicoid stability factor, and acts as a potent enhancer capable of timing the activity of an exogenous transactivator. We propose that this regulatory mode links morphogen gradients with temporal regulation during the maternal-to-zygotic transition.",

        "Abstract": "Yeast Kar4 is a putative transcription factor required for karyogamy (the fusion of haploid nuclei during mating) and possibly other functions. Previously known to be required only for the transcriptional induction of KAR3 and CIK1, microarray experiments identified many genes regulated by Kar4 in both mating and mitosis. Several gene clusters are positively or negatively regulated by mating pheromone in a Kar4-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays confirmed that Kar4 binds to regulatory DNA sequences upstream of KAR3. Together with one-hybrid experiments, these data support a model in which both Kar4 and Ste12 bind jointly to the KAR3 promoter. Analysis of the upstream regions of Kar4-induced genes identified a DNA sequence motif that may be a binding site for Kar4. Mutation within the motif upstream of KAR3 eliminated pheromone induction. Genes regulated by Kar4, on average, are delayed in their temporal expression and exhibit a more stringent dose response to pheromone. Furthermore, the induction of Kar4 by pheromone is necessary for the delayed temporal induction of KAR3 and PRM2, genes required for efficient nuclear fusion during mating. Accordingly, we propose that Kar4 plays a critical role in the choreography of the mating response.",

However, our molecular understanding of these phenotypes is based almost entirely on studies in a handful of model organisms that together represent only a small fraction of this phenotypic diversity. Furthermore, many microbial species are not amenable to traditional laboratory analysis because of their exotic lifestyles and/or lack of suitable molecular genetic techniques. As an adjunct to experimental analysis, we have developed a computational information-theoretic framework that produces high-confidence gene-phenotype predictions using cross-species distributions of genes and phenotypes across 202 fully sequenced archaea and eubacteria. In addition to identifying the genetic basis of complex traits, our approach reveals the organization of these genes into generic preferentially co-inherited modules, many of which correspond directly to known enzymatic pathways, molecular complexes, signaling pathways, and molecular machines.",

Many of these elements are complementary to the 5' extremity of known microRNAs (miRNAs), and likely correspond to their target sites. We also identify known targets of RNA-binding proteins, and many novel sites not yet known to be functional. Coherent sets of genes with similar function often bear the same conserved elements, providing new insights into their cellular functions. We also show that target sites for distinct miRNAs are often simultaneously conserved, suggesting combinatorial regulation by multiple miRNAs. A genome-wide search for conserved stem-loops, containing complementary sequences to the novel sites, revealed many new candidate miRNAs that likely target them. We also provide evidence that posttranscriptional networks have undergone extensive rewiring across distant phyla, despite strong conservation of regulatory elements themselves.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a powerful new approach for discovering globally conserved regulatory elements between two genomes. The method is fast, simple and comprehensive, without requiring alignments. Its application to pairs of yeasts, worms, flies and mammals yields a large number of known and novel putative regulatory elements. Many of these are validated by independent biological observations, have spatial and/or orientation biases, are co-conserved with other elements and show surprising conservation across large phylogenetic distances.",

        "Abstract": "Histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases with specificities for different sites of acetylation affect common chromatin regions. This could generate unique patterns of acetylation that may specify downstream biological processes. To search for existence of these patterns and their relationship to gene activity, we analyzed the genome-wide acetylation profiles for eleven lysines in the four core histones of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that both hyper- and hypoacetylation of individual lysines are associated with transcription, generating distinct patterns of acetylation that define groups of biologically related genes. The genes within these groups are significantly coexpressed, mediate similar physiological processes, share unique cis-regulatory DNA motifs, and are enriched for binding of specific transcription factors. Our data also indicate that the in vivo binding of the transcription factor Bdf1 is associated with acetylation on most lysines but relative deacetylation on H4 lysine 16. Thus, certain acetylation patterns may be used as surfaces for specific protein-histone interactions, providing one mechanism for coordinate regulation of chromatin processes that are biologically related.",

Our probabilistic approach identifies local DNA-sequence elements and the positional and combinatorial constraints that determine their context-dependent role in transcriptional regulation. The inferred regulatory rules correctly predict expression patterns for 73% of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, utilizing microarray expression data and sequences in the 800 bp upstream of genes. Application to Caenorhabditis elegans identifies predictive regulatory elements and combinatorial rules that control the phased temporal expression of transcription factors, histones, and germline specific genes. Successful prediction requires diverse and complex rules utilizing AND, OR, and NOT logic, with significant constraints on motif strength, orientation, and relative position. This system generates a large number of mechanistic hypotheses for focused experimental validation, and establishes a predictive dynamical framework for understanding cellular behavior from genomic sequence.",

        "Abstract": "We present a computational method for de novo identification of gene function using only cross-organismal distribution of phenotypic traits. Our approach assumes that proteins necessary for a set of phenotypic traits are preferentially conserved among organisms that share those traits. This method combines organism-to-phenotype associations,along with phylogenetic profiles,to identify proteins that have high propensities for the query phenotype; it does not require the use of any functional annotations for any proteins. We first present the statistical foundations of this approach and then apply it to a range of phenotypes to assess how its performance depends on the frequency and specificity of the phenotype. Our analysis shows that statistically significant associations are possible as long as the phenotype is neither extremely rare nor extremely common; results on the flagella,pili, thermophily,and respiratory tract tropism phenotypes suggest that reliable associations can be inferred when the phenotype does not arise from many alternate mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Comprehensive identification of DNA cis-regulatory elements is crucial for a predictive understanding of transcriptional network dynamics. Strong evidence suggests that these DNA sequence motifs are highly conserved between related species, reflecting strong selection on the network of regulatory interactions that underlie common cellular behavior. Here, we exploit a systems-level aspect of this conservation-the network-level topology of these interactions-to map transcription factor (TF) binding sites on a genomic scale. Using network-level conservation as a constraint, our algorithm finds 71% of known TF binding sites in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using only 12% of the sequence of a phylogenetic neighbor. Most of the novel predicted motifs show strong features of known TF binding sites, such as functional category and/or expression profile coherence of their corresponding genes. Network-level conservation should provide a powerful constraint for the systematic mapping of TF binding sites in the larger genomes of higher eukaryotes.",

        "Abstract": "We describe the genome-wide distribution of the histone deacetylase and repressor Rpd3 and its associated proteins Ume1 and Ume6 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a new cross-linking protocol, we found that Rpd3 binds upstream of many individual genes and upstream of members of gene classes with similar functions in anabolic processes. In addition, Rpd3 is preferentially associated with promoters that direct high transcriptional activity. We also found that Rpd3 was absent from large sub-telomeric domains. We show by co-immunoprecipitation and by the high similarity of their binding maps that Ume1 interacts with Rpd3. In contrast, despite the known role of Ume6 in Rpd3 recruitment, only a limited number of the genes targeted by Rpd3 are also enriched for (or targeted by) Ume6. This suggests that Rpd3 is brought to many promoters by alternative recruiters, some of which may bind the putative cis-regulatory DNA elements that we have identified in sets of Rpd3 target genes. Finally, we show that comparing the genome-wide pattern of Rpd3 binding with gene expression and histone acetylation in the rpd3 Delta mutant strain reveals new sites of Rpd3 function.",
