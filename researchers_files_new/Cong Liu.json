        "Abstract": "Gel-electromembrane extraction (G-EME) is an increasingly popular green variant of electromembrane extraction (EME). However, the electroendosmosis (EEO) flow associated with G-EME greatly limits the development of this technology. To address this challenge, the current study proposed the concept of confined G-EME (CG-EME), and a three-dimensional-printed modular device was elaborately designed to realize this concept. The device blocked the EEO flow by limiting the volume of the sample compartment. Moreover, the mesh structure at the bottom of the extraction module helps to prepare thin and stable gel films, which enhance the electromigration driving force and shorten the migration path. In addition, polar oligonucleotides, a nucleic acid analyte, were extracted for the first time to prove the concept of CG-EME. After optimization, 62% of the oligonucleotides were extracted at 50 V voltage for 15 min using a 3 mm thick agarose (3%) gel film. Finally, the application capability of CG-EME was further demonstrated by recovering DNA primers and isolating disease biomarkers (miRNA-181b) from real samples. In combination with CG-EME and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis, the upregulation of miRNA-181b expression in the peripheral blood of patients with schizophrenia was observed. In conclusion, this study proposes CG-EME to diminish EEO and push EME into the clinical field to isolate nucleic acid biomarkers, which will greatly expand the application scenarios of this emerging technology.",

        "Abstract": "With the continuous advancements of laparoscopic techniques, many surgeons have enhanced the feasibility and safety of this approach for carefully selected patients. This study aims to offer a comprehensive account of the technical aspects and surgical outcomes associated with laparoscopic anatomical right hepatectomy, explicitly utilizing a four-incision anterior approach. The surgical procedure involved several maneuvers, including blocking the Glissonean pedicle, ligation of the right hepatic artery, right branch of the portal vein, and the right hepatic duct, removal of the liver parenchyma along the ischemic line, and determination of the liver section based on four anatomical landmarks: the right anterior Glissonian pedicle, middle hepatic vein, root of the right hepatic vein, and retrohepatic inferior vena cava. The article provides clear visualization of these anatomical landmarks following right hepatectomy. Proper patient positioning and precise incision placement are crucial factors for ensuring the success of the laparoscopic right anterior hepatectomy procedure. The separation of the extrahepatic Glissonean pedicle at the liver hilum to determine the hepatic resection ischemia line, as well as the identification of liver sections using four anatomical landmarks are essential steps in the liver resection process. The laparoscopic anatomical right hepatectomy using a four-incision anterior approach was performed smoothly, with standard intraoperative techniques completed. Measures are in place to address any complications that may arise during the surgery.",

        "Abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are important for many biological processes, but predicting them from sequence data remains challenging. Existing deep learning models often cannot generalize to proteins not present in the training set and do not provide uncertainty estimates for their predictions. To address these limitations, we present TUnA, a Transformer-based uncertainty-aware model for PPI prediction. TUnA uses ESM-2 embeddings with Transformer encoders and incorporates a Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process. TUnA achieves state-of-the-art performance and, importantly, evaluates uncertainty for unseen sequences. We demonstrate that TUnA's uncertainty estimates can effectively identify the most reliable predictions, significantly reducing false positives. This capability is crucial in bridging the gap between computational predictions and experimental validation.",

        "Title": "Effect of music therapy on anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "Abstract": "To systematically evaluate the intervention effect of music therapy on anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients. Randomised controlled trial (RCT) on music therapy for anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients was searched from 7 major databases, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, WOS, CNIC, Wanfang, and Wipro, spanning the period of library construction to 23 October 2023, and the literature screening of music therapy for anxiety or depression in breast cancer patients was carried out by 2 experimentalists, each of whom conducted a literature screening RCT independently of the other anxiety or depression in a RCT. Methodological quality was evaluated using the PEDro scale; GRADE profiler software for quality of evidence; and RevMan 5.4 was used for effect size merging and forest plots; publication bias tests and sensitivity analyses were performed using Stata 17.0; and standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI were used as the effect statistics. A total of 13 RCTs with 1326 subjects (aged 18-70 years) were included in the literature, with a mean PEDro score of 6.8, and the literature was overall of good methodological quality. Meta-analysis showed that music therapy improved anxiety in breast cancer patients (841 cases), with a combined effect size (SMD = - 0.82, 95% CI [- 1.03, - 0.61] and P < 0.001); and improved depression in breast cancer patients (387 cases) with a combined effect size (SMD = - 0.76, 95% CI [- 1.15, - 0.38], P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that music intervention with off-site music (757 cases) and music choice of non-self-selected music (537 cases) had the best effect on anxiety improvement, with corresponding combined effect sizes (SMD = - 0.88, P < 0.001; SMD = - 0.83, P < 0.001), respectively; followed by an intervention length of < 30 min (589 cases), a frequency of 2 times/day (382 cases), and intervention period of 2-3 weeks (101 cases) had the best effect on anxiety improvement, and the corresponding combined effect sizes were (SMD = - 0.80, P < 0.001; SMD = - 0.91, P < 0.001; SMD = - 1.02, P < 0.001), respectively; and the music selection was the choice of one's own favourite music among the expert recommendations (219 cases) (270 cases) had the best effect on the improvement of depressed mood, with combined effect sizes of (SMD = - 1.15, P < 0.001; SMD = - 0.71, P < 0.001) and music with an intervention duration of 30 min (287 cases), an intervention frequency of 1 time/day (348 cases), and an intervention period of 2-4 weeks (120 cases), respectively, with corresponding combined effect sizes of (SMD = - 0.75, P < 0.001; SMD = - 0.86, P < 0.001; SMD = - 1.06, P < 0.001), respectively. Music therapy can improve anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients, and the level of evidence is moderate. Although the heterogeneity between studies is high, which may lead to bias in the results, we explored the source of heterogeneity through subgroup and sensitivity analyses, providing a good evidence-based basis for clinical practice. The heterogeneity of anxiety and depression was explored by subgroup analysis, with anxiety due to music duration and music cycle; and depression due to intervention cycles and music duration. Sensitivity analyses also identified music duration and music cycle as contributing to the heterogeneity. Also, this study has some limitations since the included literature did not take into account the duration of the disease, education, and family economic status and did not categorize the age stages. This study found that music therapy improves anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients and the results can be used as a basis for clinical practice and researcher enquiry.

        "Abstract": "Accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn) in Lewy bodies is the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Genetic mutations in lipid metabolism are causative for a subset of patients with Parkinsonism. The role of α-syn's lipid interactions in its function and aggregation is recognized, yet the specific lipids involved and how lipid metabolism issues trigger α-syn aggregation and neurodegeneration remain unclear. Here, we found that α-syn shows a preference for binding to lysophospholipids (LPLs), particularly targeting lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) without relying on electrostatic interactions. LPC is capable of maintaining α-syn in a compact conformation, significantly reducing its propensity to aggregate both ",

        "Abstract": "Stress granules (SGs), formed by untranslated messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) during cellular stress in eukaryotes, have been linked to flavivirus interference without clear understanding. This study reveals the role of Zika virus (ZIKV) NS2B as a scaffold protein mediating interaction between protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). This interaction promotes eIF2α dephosphorylation by PP1α, inhibiting SG formation. The NS2B-PP1α complex exhibits remarkable stability, resisting ubiquitin-induced degradation and amplifying eIF2α dephosphorylation, thus promoting ZIKV replication. In contrast, the NS2BV35A mutant, interacting exclusively with eIF2α, fails to inhibit SG formation, resulting in reduced viral replication and diminished impact on brain organoid growth. These findings reveal PP1α's dual role in ZIKV infection, inducing interferon production as an antiviral factor and suppressing SG formation as a viral promoter. Moreover, we found that NS2B also serves as a versatile mechanism employed by flaviviruses to counter host antiviral defenses, primarily by broadly inhibiting SG formation. This research advances our comprehension of the complex interplay in flavivirus-host interactions, offering potential for innovative therapeutic strategies against flavivirus infections.",

        "Abstract": "Enhancing the flame retardancy of epoxy (EP) resins typically entailed a trade-off with other physical properties. Herein, hyperbranched poly(amidoamine) (HPAA) and phytic acid (PA) were used to functionalize graphene oxide (GO) via electrostatic self-assembly in water to prepare a phosphorus-nitrogen functionalized graphene oxide nanosheet (PN-GOs), which could be utilized as high efficient flame-retardant additive of epoxy resin without sacrificing other properties. The PN-GOs demonstrated improved dispersion and compatibility within the EP matrix, which resulted in significant concurrent enhancements in both the mechanical performance and flame-retardant properties of the PN-GOs/EP nanocomposites over virgin EP. Notably, the incorporation of just 1.0 wt% PN-GOs yielded a 20.4, 6.4 and 42.7 % increases in flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength for the PN-GOs/EP nanocomposites, respectively. Furthermore, simultaneous reductions were achieved in the peak heat release rate (pHRR) by 60.0 %, total smoke production (TSP) by 43.0 %, peak CO production rate (pCOP) by 57.9 %, and peak CO",

        "Abstract": "Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) have been recommended by the World Health Organization for their higher efficacy, favorable safety and tolerability. However, the clinical evidence supporting switching to INSTI-containing regimens in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited, as few patients have access to these regimens. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of INSTI-containing regimens in real-world settings in China compared to government-provided free ART. We compared the short-term (first 4 mo following ART initiation) and long-term (1 year after ART initiation) effectiveness between INSTI-containing regimens and free ART drugs provided by the Chinese government in 4 dimensions: viral suppression status, immune response, liver and kidney function, and AIDS-related diseases. We obtained data from electronic medical records in the National Infectious Disease Surveillance System. To control baseline confounders, we used propensity score matching (PSM), calculated using logistic regression including socio-demographic and baseline factors. Among 12,836 patients from 2012 to 2019, 673 (5.2%) used INSTI-containing regimens. Patients with INSTI-containing regimens were matched to those with free drugs (644 vs 644). For short-term effectiveness, patients initiating INSTI-containing regimens were more likely to achieve viral suppression (81.4% vs 52.0%; P < .001). The differences in immune response, liver and kidney function and AIDS-related diseases were not significant between the 2 groups. For long-term effectiveness, viral suppression rates were similar (87.96% vs 84.59%; P = .135), with no significant differences in immune response, liver and kidney function, or AIDS-related diseases. Our study suggests that patients initiating ART with INSTI-containing regimens have worse physical status at baseline than patients starting with free ART drugs. Furthermore, we found better virological performances of INSTI-containing regimens in the short-term but not in the long-term due to a high rate of drug changes. Our findings have clinical implications and provide new evidence regarding the effectiveness of INSTI-containing regimens in LMICs.",

        "Abstract": "Nucleotide second messengers are highly versatile signaling molecules that regulate a variety of key biological processes in bacteria. The best-studied examples are cyclic AMP (cAMP) and bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), which both act as global regulators. Global regulatory frameworks of c-di-GMP and cAMP in bacteria show several parallels but also significant variances. In this review, we illustrate the global regulatory models of the two nucleotide second messengers, compare the different regulatory frameworks between c-di-GMP and cAMP, and discuss the mechanisms and physiological significance of cross-regulation between c-di-GMP and cAMP. c-di-GMP responds to numerous signals dependent on a great number of metabolic enzymes, and it regulates various signal transduction pathways through its huge number of effectors with varying activities. In contrast, due to the limited quantity, the cAMP metabolic enzymes and its major effector are regulated at different levels by diverse signals. cAMP performs its global regulatory function primarily by controlling the transcription of a large number of genes via cAMP receptor protein (CRP) in most bacteria. This review can help us understand how bacteria use the two typical nucleotide second messengers to effectively coordinate and integrate various physiological processes, providing theoretical guidelines for future research.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, the dynamic marine atmospheric corrosion behavior of AZ91 Mg alloy sailing from Yellow Sea to Western Pacific Ocean was studied. The corrosion rates were measured using the weight loss method. The microstructure, phase, and chemical composition of corroded samples were investigated by SEM, EDS, XRD, and XPS. The results show that the evolution of corrosion rates of AZ91 Mg alloy was divided into three stages: rapidly increasing during the first 3 months, then remaining stable for the next three months, and finally decreasing after 6 months. The annual corrosion rate of Mg alloy reached 32.50 μm/y after exposure for 12 months in a dynamic marine atmospheric environment, which was several times higher than that of the static field exposure tests. AZ91 magnesium alloy was mainly subjected to localized corrosion with more destructiveness to Mg parts, which is mainly due to the synergistic effect of high relative humidity, the high deposition rate of chloride ion, sulfur dioxide acidic gas produced by fuel combustion, and rapid temperature changes caused by the alternating changes in longitude and latitude during navigation. As the exposure time increased, the corrosion pits gradually increased and deepened. The maximum depth of the corrosion pit was 197 μm after 12 months of exposure, which is almost 6 times the average corrosion depth. This study provides scientific data support for the application of magnesium alloys in shipborne aircraft and electronic equipment. The results could provide guidance for the design of new magnesium alloys and development of anti-corrosion technologies.",

Phenopackets is an expert knowledge-driven schema designed to facilitate the storage and exchange of multimodal patient data, and support downstream analysis. The first goal of this paper is to explore model alignment by characterizing the common data models using a newly developed data transformation process and evaluation method. Second, using OMOP normalized clinical data, we evaluate the mapping of real-world patient data to Phenopackets. We evaluate the suitability of Phenopackets as a patient data representation for real-world clinical cases.",

Mg-BG powders with different Mg concentrations were successfully synthesized via the sol-gel method and evaluated using x-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Apatite formation was observed on the surfaces of the materials after soaking in simulated body fluid. hDPSCs were cultured with Mg-BG powder extracts in vitro, and no evident cytotoxicity was observed. Mg-BG induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression and mineralization of hDPSCs and upregulated the expression of odontogenic genes, including those encoding dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein 1, ALP, osteocalcin, and runt-related transcription factor 2. Moreover, Mg-BG substantially suppressed the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Collectively, the results of this study suggest that Mg-BG has excellent in vitro bioactivity and is a potential material for vital pulp therapy of inflamed pulps.",

In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was used to benchmark seven exchange correlation functionals at different basis sets for 17 atomically precise nanoclusters against experimentally determined geometries, band gaps, and optical gaps. The set contains both monometallic and bimetallic clusters that possess at least two types of 3d transition metals (specifically, Cu, Ni, Fe, or Co). The benchmark highlights that PBE0 is a good functional to use regardless of the basis set, and Minnesota functionals do well with respect to specific metals. Further, while long-range corrected functionals overestimate band and optical gaps, they model absorption features better than the other considered functionals. The study additionally looks at the photoinduced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the CO",

        "Title": "SAMP: Identifying Antimicrobial Peptides by an Ensemble Learning Model Based on Proportionalized Split Amino Acid Composition.",
        "Abstract": "It is projected that 10 million deaths could be attributed to drug-resistant bacteria infections in 2050. To address this concern, identifying new-generation antibiotics is an effective way. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a class of innate immune effectors, have received significant attention for their capacity to eliminate drug-resistant pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Recent years have witnessed widespread applications of computational methods especially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for discovering AMPs. However, existing methods only use features including compositional, physiochemical, and structural properties of peptides, which cannot fully capture sequence information from AMPs. Here, we present SAMP, an ensemble random projection (RP) based computational model that leverages a new type of features called Proportionalized Split Amino Acid Composition (PSAAC) in addition to conventional sequence-based features for AMP prediction. With this new feature set, SAMP captures the residue patterns like sorting signals at around both the N-terminus and the C-terminus, while also retaining the sequence order information from the middle peptide fragments. Benchmarking tests on different balanced and imbalanced datasets demonstrate that SAMP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, such as iAMPpred and AMPScanner V2, in terms of accuracy, MCC, G-measure and F1-score. In addition, by leveraging an ensemble RP architecture, SAMP is scalable to processing large-scale AMP identification with further performance improvement, compared to those models without RP. To facilitate the use of SAMP, we have developed a Python package freely available at https://github.com/wan-mlab/SAMP.",

        "Abstract": "Individuals with suspected rare genetic disorders often undergo multiple clinical evaluations, imaging studies, laboratory tests and genetic tests, to find a possible answer over a prolonged period of time. Addressing this \"diagnostic odyssey\" thus has substantial clinical, psychosocial, and economic benefits. Many rare genetic diseases have distinctive facial features, which can be used by artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate clinical diagnosis, in prioritizing candidate diseases to be further examined by lab tests or genetic assays, or in helping the phenotype-driven reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data. Existing methods using frontal facial photos were built on conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), rely exclusively on facial images, and cannot capture non-facial phenotypic traits and demographic information essential for guiding accurate diagnoses. Here we introduce GestaltMML, a multimodal machine learning (MML) approach solely based on the Transformer architecture. It integrates facial images, demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), and clinical notes (optionally, a list of Human Phenotype Ontology terms) to improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we also evaluated GestaltMML on a diverse range of datasets, including 528 diseases from the GestaltMatcher Database, several in-house datasets of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, over-growth syndrome with distinct facial features), Sotos syndrome (overgrowth syndrome with overlapping features with BWS), NAA10-related neurodevelopmental syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome), and KBG syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome). Our results suggest that GestaltMML effectively incorporates multiple modalities of data, greatly narrowing candidate genetic diagnoses of rare diseases and may facilitate the reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data.",

This retrospective study investigated 51 cases of extended suicide involving mental disorders in central China with aim of better understanding risk factors for such events and guiding prevention strategies. Over an 8-year period from 2015 to 2022, cases were collected from forensic institutions, and demographic characteristics, case details, and psychiatric data were recorded. The 51 incidents involved 51 perpetrators and 79 victims, with more female perpetrators (58.8%) and more female victims (54.4%). The average age of the perpetrators was 36.1, and most were married (88.2%). Almost all of the victims were family members of the perpetrator, like the most numerous children (64.6%), followed by spouses (24.1%). The most common homicide mode of death was mechanical asphyxia (38.0%), followed by sharp devices (36.7%) and drug poisoning (16.5%). Depressive disorders (76.5%) were the most common diagnosis of mental disorder for perpetrators. The study analyzed the unique characteristics of extended suicide to enrich such data. These findings help strengthen the screening and identification of potential perpetrators and victims to prevent such cases from occurring.",

Therefore, a novel bone cement based on magnesium-doped bioactive glass was developed in this study. The moderate release of magnesium ions improved the mechanical properties by controlling the crystal size of hydroxyapatite. Through detailed discussion of element content and heat treatment temperature, it was found that 2Mg-BG-800 was suitable for the construction of bone cement. 2Mg-BG-BC exhibited favorable initial (15 min) and final (30 min) setting time, compressive strength (29.45 MPa), compressive modulus (1851.49 MPa), injectability, and shape-adaptability. Furthermore, Mg-BG-BC demonstrated the ability to enhance the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and induce macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype, suggesting its potential for osteoporotic fracture regeneration.",

Currently, the selection of key frames relies on the doctor's visual judgement which is time-consuming and laborious. This study proposes a key frame recognition algorithm based on deep learning. Firstly, wavelet denoising and multi-scale vessel-enhanced filtering are used to preserve the morphological features of the adrenal veins. Furthermore, by incorporating the self-attention mechanism, an improved recognition model called ResNet50-SA is obtained.

The accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a central role in DR development. The aim of this research was to examine the impact and mechanisms of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEV) on regulating ROS and retinal damage in DR. Intravitreal injection of sEV inhibited Cullin3 neddylation, stabilized Nrf2, decreased ROS, reduced retinal inflammation, suppressed Müller gliosis, and mitigated DR. Based on MSC-sEV miRNA sequencing, bioinformatics software, and dual-luciferase reporter assay, miR-143-3p was identified to be the key effector for MSC-sEV's role in regulating neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8)-mediated neddylation. sEV were able to be internalized by Müller cells. Compared to advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)-induced Müller cells, sEV coculture decreased Cullin3 neddylation, activated Nrf2 signal pathway to combat ROS-induced inflammation. The barrier function of endothelial cells was impaired when endothelial cells were treated with the supernatant of AGEs-induced Müller cells, but was restored when treated with supernatant of AGEs-induced Müller cells cocultured with sEV. The protective effect of sEV was, however, compromised when miR-143-3p was inhibited in sEV. Moreover, the protective efficacy of sEV was diminished when NEDD8 was overexpressed in Müller cells. These findings showed MSC-sEV delivered miR-143-3p to inhibit Cullin3 neddylation, stabilizing Nrf2 to counteract ROS-induced inflammation and reducing vascular leakage. Our findings suggest that MSC-sEV may be a potential nanotherapeutic agent for DR, and that Cullin3 neddylation could be a new target for DR therapy.",

        "Abstract": "For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, the rupture of thin lymphatic vessel walls leads to a profuse outflow of lymph fluid. Typically, chyloperitoneum tends to precede the development of chylothorax in patients with cancer. The present study describes the case of a male patient with hepatocellular carcinoma who developed chylothorax without chyloperitoneum. Computed tomography showed lymphatic system developmental abnormalities with a large volume of leaked lymph fluid. Multiple thoracic duct ligations (TDLs) failed, but a side-to-end lymphatic venous anastomosis (LVA) surgery resolved the symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of chylothorax occurrence after cirrhosis further complicated by congenital lymphatic abnormalities in the English-language literature. In conclusion, LVA could be appropriate to treat chylothorax when TDL is ineffective as a remedial or even prophylactic intervention.",

Iodine also has extrathyroidal effects on organs that can uptake it independently of thyroid hormones. Recently, multiple clinical studies have shown a connection between iodine intake and metabolic disorders, such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. However, the results of these studies have been inconsistent, and the mechanisms behind these associations are still not well understood.

        "Abstract": "Phenotype-driven gene prioritization is a critical process in the diagnosis of rare genetic disorders for identifying and ranking potential disease-causing genes based on observed physical traits or phenotypes. While traditional approaches rely on curated knowledge graphs with phenotype-gene relations, recent advancements in large language models have opened doors to the potential of AI predictions through extensive training on diverse corpora and complex models. This study conducted a comprehensive evaluation of five large language models, including two Generative Pre-trained Transformers series, and three Llama2 series, assessing their performance across three key metrics: task completeness, gene prediction accuracy, and adherence to required output structures. Various experiments explored combinations of models, prompts, input types, and task difficulty levels. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing LLM, GPT-4, achieved an accuracy of 16.0%, which still lags behind traditional bioinformatics tools. Prediction accuracy increased with the parameter/model size. A similar increasing trend was observed for the task completion rate, with complicated prompts more likely to increase task completeness in models smaller than GPT-4. However, complicated prompts are more likely to decrease the structure compliance rate, but no prompt effects on GPT-4. Compared to HPO term-based input, LLM was also able to achieve better than random prediction accuracy by taking free-text input, but slightly lower than with the HPO input. Bias analysis showed that certain genes, such as MECP2, CDKL5, and SCN1A, are more likely to be top-ranked, potentially explaining the variances observed across different datasets. This study provides valuable insights into the integration of LLMs within genomic analysis, contributing to the ongoing discussion on the utilization of advanced LLMs in clinical workflows.",

        "Abstract": "Rectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumours worldwide, and it is also one of the major diseases that seriously threatens human life and health. At present, the main treatment for rectal cancer is still surgical treatment. The surgical methods have been rapidly developed from the previous open surgery to the current minimally invasive surgery. At present, there are two main minimally invasive surgeries: robotic surgery and laparoscopic surgery. Due to the particularity of rectal cancer surgery, more and more studies have shown that robotic rectal cancer surgery has more advantages than laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. However, whether the incidence of postoperative complications after robotic rectal cancer surgery is lower than that after laparoscopy is not uniformly conclusive in the current study. Therefore, in this paper, we searched Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase and other databases, collected the latest published meta-analysis on postoperative complications of robots and laparoscopy in rectal cancer, and assessed the quality of the included meta-analysis by AMSTAR-2 evaluation tool, so as to explore the current research status and research quality of postoperative complications of robots and laparoscopy in rectal cancer. The results showed that compared with laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery, robotic rectal cancer surgery could improve the postoperative urinary and reproductive function of male patients, but it could not be proved that robotic rectal cancer surgery could reduce the incidence of postoperative complications, anastomotic leakage, urinary retention, intestinal obstruction, anastomotic bleeding, incision infection, pulmonary infection, venous thrombosis and abdominal abscess; however, the overall quality of meta-analysis of the results of each complication was low or very low. Therefore, multicenter, large-sample, high-quality prospective randomised controlled studies and high-quality meta-analysis are still needed to prove the advantages of robotic rectal cancer surgery in postoperative complications in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Environmental hypoxia adversely affects reproductive health in humans and animals at high altitudes. Therefore, how to alleviate the follicle development disorder caused by hypoxia exposure and to improve the competence of fertility in plateau non-habituated female animals are important problems to be solved urgently. In this study, a hypobaric hypoxic chamber was used for 4 weeks to simulate hypoxic conditions in female mice, and the effects of hypoxia on follicle development, proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MII oocyte and 2-cell rate were evaluated. At the same time, the alleviating effect of melatonin on hypoxic exposure-induced oogenesis damage was evaluated by feeding appropriate amounts of melatonin daily under hypoxia for 4 weeks. The results showed that hypoxia exposure significantly increased the proportion of antral follicles in the ovary, the number of proliferation and apoptosis granulosa cells in the follicle, and the level of ROS in MII oocytes, eventually led to the decline of oocyte quality. However, these defects were alleviated when melatonin was fed under hypoxia conditions. Together, these findings suggest that hypoxia exposure impaired follicular development and reduced oocyte quality, and that melatonin supplementation alleviated the fertility reduction induced by hypoxia exposure.",

In this study, we identified thrombin receptor activating peptide-6 (TRAP-6, peptide sequence: SFLLRN) as an activator of GPR15. GRP15 and β-arrestin2 were needed for TRAP-6-mediated inhibition of mixed lymphocyte reactions. TRAP-6 decreased acute GvHD in allotransplant models in mice, an effect dependent on GPR15-expression in donor T-cells. RNA-seq and protein analyses indicated TRAP-6 increased binding of β-arrestin2/TAB1 and inhibited phosphorylation of TAK1 and NF-κB-P65. GPR15 is expressed differently on CD4",

In this report, we present an important Pst effector, Pst03724, whose mRNA expression level increases during Pst infection of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Silencing of Pst03724 reduced the growth and development of Pst. Pst03724 targeted the wheat calmodulin TaCaM3-2B, a positive regulator of wheat immunity. Subsequent investigations revealed that Pst03724 interferes with the TaCaM3-2B-NAD kinase (NADK) TaNADK2 association and thus inhibits the enzyme activity of TaNADK2 activated by TaCaM3-2B. Knocking down TaNADK2 expression by virus-mediated gene silencing significantly increased fungal growth and development, suggesting a decrease in resistance against Pst infection. In conclusion, our findings indicate that Pst effector Pst03724 inhibits the activity of NADK by interfering with the TaCaM3-2B-TaNADK2 association, thereby facilitating Pst infection.",

        "Abstract": "The titanium-stabilized austenitic stainless steel Fe-15Cr-15Ni, which shows enhanced resistance to irradiation swelling compared with more traditional 316Ti, has been selected as a core material for fast reactors. Data on the evolution of irradiation swelling in 15-15Ti steels at very high doses, which cannot be easily achieved by neutron irradiation, are still lacking. In this paper, the swelling behavior of the titanium-modified austenitic stainless steel 15-15Ti was investigated by pre-implantation of He at room temperature followed by Ni-ion irradiation at 580 °C to peak doses of 120, 240 and 400 dpa. Relatively small cavities were observed in the zone of helium implantation, while large cavities appeared in the region near the damage peak. A correction formula for the dpa curve was proposed and applied to samples with large swelling. It was found that the steady-state swelling rate of 15-15Ti remains at ~1%/dpa even at high doses. By comparing the swelling data of the helium-implanted and helium-free regions at same doses, 70 dpa and 122 dpa, the suppression of swelling by excessive helium can be deduced at such doses.",

        "Title": "Do accent and input modality modulate processing of language switches in bilingual language comprehension?",
        "Abstract": "We examined how bilinguals process language switches between their first (L1) and second language (L2). Language switching costs (slower responses to language switch than nonswitch trials) appear to arise more systematically in production than in comprehension, possibly because the latter context might sometimes elicit less language coactivation (Declerck et al., 2019). This might reduce language competition and in turn the need for bilinguals to apply language control when processing language switches. Yet even in comprehension, language coactivation may vary depending on variables such as the accent of the speaker (e.g., whether the L2 words are pronounced with an L1 or L2 accent) and input modality (spoken or written). In three experiments conducted during 2021-2022, we tested how unbalanced Mandarin-English bilinguals processed language switches during comprehension and the potential influence of a speaker's accent and input modality. Overall, across settings, participants experienced significant language switching costs. In some conditions, switching costs were larger to L1-Mandarin than to L2-English, an asymmetry consistent with the participants' dominance in L1-Mandarin and the application of language control. However, manipulating accent and input modality did not influence language switches, suggesting they did not impact language coactivation sufficiently to modulate language control.

        "Abstract": "Spread Through Air Spaces (STAS) is involved in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) recurrence, where cancer cells spread into adjacent lung tissue, impacting surgical planning and prognosis assessment. Radiomics-based models show promise in predicting STAS preoperatively, enhancing surgical precision and prognostic evaluations. The present study performed network meta-analysis to assess the predictive efficacy of imaging models for STAS in LUAD. Data were systematically sourced from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Wiley and Web of Science, according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions) and A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2. Using Stata software v17.0 for meta-analysis, surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) was applied to identify the most effective diagnostic method. Quality assessments were performed using Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias tool and publication bias was assessed using Deeks' funnel plot. The analysis encompassed 14 articles, involving 3,734 patients, and assessed 17 predictive models for STAS in LUAD. According to comprehensive analysis of SUCRA, the machine learning (ML)_Peri_tumour model had the highest accuracy (56.5), the Features_computed tomography (CT) model had the highest sensitivity (51.9) and the positron emission tomography (pet)_CT model had the highest specificity (53.9). ML_Peri_tumour model had the highest predictive performance. The accuracy was as follows: ML_Peri_tumour vs. Features_CT [relative risk (RR)=1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-1.32]; ML_Peri_tumour vs. ML_Tumour (RR=1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.30) and ML_Peri_tumour vs. pet_CT (RR=1.04; 95% CI, 0.84-1.29). Comparative analyses revealed heightened predictive accuracy of the ML_Peri_tumour compared with other models. Nonetheless, the field of radiological feature analysis for STAS prediction remains nascent, necessitating improvements in technical reproducibility and comprehensive model evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "High-quality conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films with orientation and controlled structure are extremely desired for applications. Here, we report the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template-assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. The structure of pZn/PTPCz composite thin films and nitrophenol sensing performance were thoroughly studied. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, the as-prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive. This was attributed to the metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) of porous nanostructured zinc (pZn) and the additional macroporosity of the pZn/PTPCz composite films. This work provides a feasible approach for creating oriented 3D CMP-based thin films for advanced applications.",

        "Abstract": "To enhance phenotype recognition in clinical notes of genetic diseases, we developed two models-PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT-for expanding the vocabularies of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. While HPO offers a standardized vocabulary for phenotypes, existing tools often fail to capture the full scope of phenotypes due to limitations from traditional heuristic or rule-based approaches. Our models leverage large language models to automate the detection of phenotype terms, including those not in the current HPO. We compare these models with PhenoTagger, another HPO recognition tool, and found that our models identify a wider range of phenotype concepts, including previously uncharacterized ones. Our models also show strong performance in case studies on biomedical literature. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of BERT- and GPT-based models in aspects such as architecture and accuracy. Overall, our models enhance automated phenotype detection from clinical texts, improving downstream analyses on human diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Online gaming addiction (OGA) has become a noteworthy public concern, especially among university students, thereby requiring in-depth scrutiny. Although previous cross-sectional studies have established a positive link between loneliness and OGA, there is a lack of longitudinal evidence within this field. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms that elucidate the connection between loneliness and OGA are still poorly understood, underscoring a crucial research gap that requires further investigation. Our study utilized a longitudinal approach and developed a moderated mediation model. From September 2021 to September 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic, data were collected from a sample of Chinese undergraduate students, with 367 participants at T1, 352 at T2, and 340 at T3. Participants completed online self-report surveys, providing valuable data on their levels of loneliness at T1, fear of missing out (FoMO) at T2, sensation seeking at T2, and OGA at T3. Our findings found that loneliness was positively linked to OGA. Further analysis demonstrated that FoMO partially mediated the link between loneliness and OGA. Meanwhile, sensation seeking moderated the pathway from FoMO to later OGA. Specifically, the effect of FoMO on OGA was significant for college students with high sensation seeking. This study offers longitudinal evidence linking loneliness and OGA, which has implications for the development of interventions to reduce OGA.",

        "Title": "Magnetic resonance imaging-based classification of the myodural bridge complex and its influencing factors.",
        "Abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation is considered the third circulation of the human body. Recently, some scholars have proposed the myodural bridge (MDB) as a novel power source for CSF flow. Moreover, the suboccipital muscles can exert a driving force on the CSF via the MDB. This hypothesis is directly supported by head rotation and nodding movements, which can affect CSF circulation. The MDB has been validated as a normal structure in humans and mammals. In addition, the fusion of MDB fibers of different origins that act in concert with each other forms the MDB complex (MDBC). The MDBC may be associated with several CSF disorder-related neurological disorders in clinical practice. Therefore, the morphology of the MDBC and its influencing factors must be determined. In this study, T2-weighted imaging sagittal images of the cervical region were analyzed retrospectively in 1085 patients, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typing of the MDBC was performed according to the imaging features of the MDBC in the posterior atlanto-occipital interspace (PAOiS) and posterior atlanto-axial interspace (PAAiS). The effects of age and age-related degenerative changes in the cervical spine on MRI staging of the MDBC were also determined. The results revealed four MRI types of the MDBC: type A (no MDBC hyposignal shadow connected to the dura mater in either the PAOiS or PAAiS), type B (MDBC hyposignal shadow connected to the dura mater in the PAOiS only), type C (MDBC hyposignal shadow connected to the dura mater in the PAAiS only), and type D (MDBC hyposignal shadow connected to the dura mater in both the PAOiS and PAAiS). The influencing factors for the MDBC typing were age (group), degree of intervertebral space stenosis, dorsal osteophytosis, and degenerative changes in the cervical spine (P < 0.05). With increasing age (10-year interval), the incidence of type B MDBC markedly decreased, whereas that of type A MDBC increased considerably. With the deepening of the degree of intervertebral space stenosis, the incidence of type C MDBC increased significantly, whereas that of type A MDBC decreased. In the presence of dorsal osteophytosis, the incidence of type C and D MDBCs significantly decreased, whereas that of type A increased. In the presence of protrusion of the intervertebral disc, the incidence of type B, C, and D MDBCs increased markedly, whereas that of type A MDBC decreased considerably, with cervical degenerative changes combined with spinal canal stenosis. Moreover, the incidence of both type C and D MDBCs increased, whereas that of type A MDBC decreased. Based on the MRI signal characteristics of the dural side of the MDBC, four types of the MDBC were identified. MDBC typing varies dynamically according to population distribution, depending on age and cervical degeneration (degree of intervertebral space stenosis, vertebral dorsal osteophytosis formation, simple protrusion of intervertebral disc, and cervical degeneration changes combined with spinal canal stenosis, except for the degree of protrusion of the intervertebral disc and the degree of spinal canal stenosis); however, it is not influenced by sex.",

        "Abstract": "The microorganisms in sediments play a crucial role in biogeochemical cycle processes, and numerous studies have shown that microbial community is closely related to environmental factors. However, the usability of sediment microorganisms to evaluate the eco-environment quality of rural rivers has not been adequately explored. This study investigated the distribution characteristics and response of sediment microorganisms to environmental parameters and benthic organisms. Based on the environmental parameters and benthic community indices, the 12 stations were divided into high-polluted group A, moderate-polluted group B and low-polluted group C. Station DG01 and DG02 in group A had the highest level of As and Ni pollution and nutrient concentration, and DG09 in group A had the lowest benthic diversity. Correspondingly, group A had the lowest abundance of Proteobacteria, which has a higher requirement for the environment than Planctomycetes. Group B had the highest sulfide level (97.45 mg/kg), and bacteria (Thiobacillus, Sulfurisoma and Sulfuritalea) with genes involved in sulfur cycling were more enriched in this group. Group C had the lowest level of total nitrogen (243.36 mg/kg), and Rhodanobacteraceae in Xanthomonadales might be a key bioindicator for low nitrogen. In addition, Chlorophyta was found to be more susceptible to heavy metals, and moreover co-occurrence networks showed that microeukaryotes were more sensitive to heavy metal pollution compared to benthic animals and prokaryotes. Therefore, this study suggested that benthic microorganisms especially microeukaryotes could be used as good indicators for evaluating the eco-environmental quality of rural rivers.",

        "Title": "Nonmonotonic enhancement of diversity-induced resonance in systems of mobile oscillators.",
        "Abstract": "Diversity is omnipresent in natural and synthetic extended systems, the phenomenon of diversity-induced resonance (DIR), wherein a moderate degree of the diversity can provoke an optimal collective response, provides researchers a brand-new strategy to amplify and utilize the weak signal. As yet the relevant advances focus mostly on the ideal situations where the interactions among elements are uncorrelated with the physical proximity of agents. Such a consideration overlooks interactions mediated by the motion of agents in space. Here, we investigate the signal response of an ensemble of spatial mobile heterogeneous bistable oscillators with two canonical interacting modes: dynamic and preset. The oscillators are considered as mass points and perform random walks in a two-dimensional square plane. Under the dynamic scheme, the oscillators can only interact with other oscillators within a fixed vision radius. For the preset circumstance, the interaction among oscillators occurs only when all of them are in a predefined region at the same moment. We find that the DIR can be obtained in both situations. Additionally, the strength of resonance nonmonotonically rises with respect to the increase of moving speed, and the optimal resonance is acquired by an intermediate magnitude of speed. Finally, we propose reduced equations to guarantee the occurrence of such mobility-optimized DIR on the basis of the fast switching approximation theory and also examine the robustness of such phenomenon through the excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo model and a different spatial motion mechanism. Our results reveal for the first time that the DIR can be optimized by the spatial mobility and thus has promising potential application in the communication of mobile agents.",

        "Abstract": "The \"Yufen 1\" H line chicken (YF) has excellent characteristics including early sexual maturity and high egg production, and the conservation of its genetic diversity is the core of the breeding activity. To overcome misrepresented breeds and protect the integrity of the germplasm genetic resources, it is important to develop accurate and convenient methods to identify YF. In this study, whole genome resequencing was performed on the YF population, and bioinformatics analysis was conducted by combining the data from different breeds. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed that YF had the slowest LD-decay rate, suggesting strong natural and artificial selection in its history. Through selective sweep analysis, 1,126 selected regions in YF were identified, which contained 163,661 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In particular, 5 specific SNPs (SNP1: Chr2:45509616, SNP2: Chr2:45510792, SNP3: Chr9:13788193, SNP4: Chr9:13795646, SNP5: Chr9:13798154) were found exclusively in the YF population. Subsequently, PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of these 5 SNPs in YF. Finally, 4 SNPs (SNP1, SNP2, SNP4, SNP5) were screened and verified using the Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) typing technique. These SNPs can be used as specific molecular identity cards (IDs) for YF authentication. The present study is of great significance to ensure sustainable conservation and promotion of YF germplasm resources.",

        "Abstract": "Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) secretes effector proteins that enter plant cells and manipulate host processes. In a previous study, we identified a glycine-serine-rich effector PstGSRE4, which was proven to regulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway by interacting with TaCZSOD2. In this study, we further demonstrated that PstGSRE4 interacts with wheat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase TaGAPDH2, which is related to ROS signalling. In wheat, silencing of TaGAPDH2 by virus-induced gene silencing increased the accumulation of ROS induced by the Pst virulent race CYR31. Overexpression of TaGAPDH2 decreased the accumulation of ROS induced by the avirulent Pst race CYR23. In addition, TaGAPDH2 suppressed Pst candidate elicitor Pst322-triggered cell death by decreasing ROS accumulation in Nicotiana benthamiana. Knocking down TaGAPDH2 expression attenuated Pst infection, whereas overexpression of TaGAPDH2 promoted Pst infection, indicating that TaGAPDH2 is a negative regulator of plant defence. In N. benthamiana, PstGSRE4 stabilized TaGAPDH2 through inhibition of the 26S proteasome-mediated destabilization. Overall, these results suggest that TaGAPDH2 is hijacked by the Pst effector as a negative regulator of plant immunity to promote Pst infection in wheat.",

This study aimed to investigate the associations between all criteria air pollutants and hospitalization of cause-specific cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in China. We obtained data on CVD hospitalization events of four major categories and 12 specific diseases from 153 hospitals distributed in 20 provincial-level regions from 2013 to 2020. We adopted a time-stratified case-crossover study design using individual cases to capture the effect of short-term exposure to six criteria air pollutants on CVD hospitalizations, using conditional logistic regression models. More than 1.1 million CVD hospitalization events were included. The lag pattern exploration demonstrated the largest effect for six air pollutants on lag 0-1 day. PM",

        "Abstract": "Inclusion bodies (IBs) of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and contain internal structures termed \"IB-associated granules\" (IBAGs), where anti-termination factor M2-1 and viral mRNAs are concentrated. However, the mechanism of IBAG formation and the physiological function of IBAGs are unclear. Here, we found that the internal structures of RSV IBs are actual M2-1-free viral messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) condensates formed by secondary LLPS. Mechanistically, the RSV nucleoprotein (N) and M2-1 interact with and recruit PABP to IBs, promoting PABP to bind viral mRNAs transcribed in IBs by RNA-recognition motif and drive secondary phase separation. Furthermore, PABP-eIF4G1 interaction regulates viral mRNP condensate composition, thereby recruiting specific translation initiation factors (eIF4G1, eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF4B and eIF4H) into the secondary condensed phase to activate viral mRNAs for ribosomal recruitment. Our study proposes a novel LLPS-regulated translation mechanism during viral infection and a novel antiviral strategy via targeting on secondary condensed phase.",

        "Abstract": "Rare disease patients often endure prolonged diagnostic odysseys and may still remain undiagnosed for years. Selecting the appropriate genetic tests is crucial to lead to timely diagnosis. Phenotypic features offer great potential for aiding genomic diagnosis in rare disease cases. We see great promise in effective integration of phenotypic information into genetic test selection workflow. In this study, we present a phenotype-driven molecular genetic test recommendation (Phen2Test) for pediatric rare disease diagnosis. Phen2Test was constructed using frequency matrix of phecodes and demographic data from the EHR before ordering genetic tests, with the objective to streamline the selection of molecular genetic tests (whole-exome / whole-genome sequencing, or gene panels) for clinicians with minimum genetic training expertise. We developed and evaluated binary classifiers based on 1,005 individuals referred to genetic counselors for potential genetic evaluation. In the evaluation using the gold standard cohort, the model achieved strong performance with an AUROC of 0.82 and an AUPRC of 0.92. Furthermore, we tested the model on another silver standard cohort (n=6,458), achieving an overall AUROC of 0.72 and an AUPRC of 0.671. Phen2Test was adjusted to align with current clinical guidelines, showing superior performance with more recent data, demonstrating its potential for use within a learning healthcare system as a genomic medicine intervention that adapts to guideline updates. This study showcases the practical utility of phenotypic features in recommending molecular genetic tests with performance comparable to clinical geneticists. Phen2Test could assist clinicians with limited genetic training and knowledge to order appropriate genetic tests.",

        "Abstract": "To enhance phenotype recognition in clinical notes of genetic diseases, we developed two models - PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT - for expanding the vocabularies of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. While HPO offers a standardized vocabulary for phenotypes, existing tools often fail to capture the full scope of phenotypes, due to limitations from traditional heuristic or rule-based approaches. Our models leverage large language models (LLMs) to automate the detection of phenotype terms, including those not in the current HPO. We compared these models to PhenoTagger, another HPO recognition tool, and found that our models identify a wider range of phenotype concepts, including previously uncharacterized ones. Our models also showed strong performance in case studies on biomedical literature. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of BERT-based and GPT-based models in aspects such as architecture and accuracy. Overall, our models enhance automated phenotype detection from clinical texts, improving downstream analyses on human diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Nanoplastics and heavy metals are common pollutants in coastal environments with high concerns, but their joint ecological risk to marine primary productivity remains unclear. In this study, the effects of 7, 70, 700 μg/L lead (Pb) single exposure and in combination with 200 μg/L polystyrene nanoplastics (NPs, 70 nm) on marine microalga Platymonas helgolandica were investigated. Pb single exposure induced a dose-dependent inhibition on the growth of P. helgolandica, which was associated with the reduced photosynthetic efficiency and nutrient accumulation. Compared to Pb single exposure, the addition of NPs significantly reduced the photosynthetic efficiency and aggravated the damage to cell structure. Reduced esterase activity and increased membrane permeability also indicated that NPs exacerbated the adverse effects of Pb on P. helgolandica. Thus, co-exposure to NPs and Pb induced more severe impacts on marine microalgae, suggesting that the joint ecological risk of NPs and heavy metals to marine primary productivity merits more attention.",

To investigate the relationship between the electron-donor substitution and luminescent properties of ESIPT luminogens, four 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole derivatives with donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A)-structured were synthesized. The distinct fluorescence properties of them were found to be highly dependent on the electron-donor moiety (triphenylamine and anthracenyl), its substituent position (para and meta position) and solvent polarity. The M-TPA, P-En, and M-En showed ESIPT emission in organic solvents, while the P-TPA showed intramolecular charge transfer process (ICT) emission. It is due to the synergistic effect of the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and ESIPT, that M-TPA and M-En exhibited high solid-state quantum yields and large Stokes shifts. They were used as a probe for detecting F",

        "Abstract": "African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) infection causes an acute and highly contagious disease in swine, resulting in significant economic losses and societal harm worldwide. Currently, there are no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs available for ASFV. Tetrandrine (TET) is extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Stephania tetrandrae, possesses diverse biological functions such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and antiviral activities. The study comprehensively evaluated the anti-ASFV effect of TET and validated it through biological assays. The dose-dependent inhibition of TET against ASFV was confirmed and a novel mechanism of TET's anti-ASFV activity was elucidated. TET effectively inhibits ASFV during internalization by blocking macropinocytosis through the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. The specific inhibitor LY294002, targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway, exhibits similar antiviral activity against ASFV as TET. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of TET against other viruses such as Lumpy Skin Disease Virus (LSDV) and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) was also identified. Our findings suggest that TET effectively inhibits ASFV and reveal the potential for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Many cancers harbor homologous recombination defects (HRDs). A HRD is a therapeutic target that is being successfully utilized in treatment of breast/ovarian cancer via synthetic lethality. However, canonical HRD caused by BRCAness mutations do not prevail in liver cancer. Here we report a subtype of HRD caused by the perturbation of a proteasome variant (CDW19S) in hepatitis B virus-bearing (HBV-bearing) cells. This amalgamate protein complex contained the 19S proteasome decorated with CRL4WDR70 ubiquitin ligase, and assembled at broken chromatin in a PSMD4Rpn10- and ATM-MDC1-RNF8-dependent manner. CDW19S promoted DNA end processing via segregated modules that promote nuclease activities of MRE11 and EXO1. Contrarily, a proteasomal component, ADRM1Rpn13, inhibited resection and was removed by CRL4WDR70-catalyzed ubiquitination upon commitment of extensive resection. HBx interfered with ADRM1Rpn13 degradation, leading to the imposition of ADRM1Rpn13-dependent resection barrier and consequent viral HRD subtype distinguishable from that caused by BRCA1 defect. Finally, we demonstrated that viral HRD in HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma can be exploited to restrict tumor progression. Our work clarifies the underlying mechanism of a virus-induced HRD subtype.",

        "Abstract": "Sleep-dependent consolidation is important for novel word learning, but previous studies have neglected the potential modulating role of learning environments. The present study examines sleep-dependent consolidation effects by comparing learning in a virtual reality (VR) environment and in a traditional picture-word (PW) environment. Two groups of Chinese-English bilinguals were randomly assigned to a VR or PW environment. In both learning environments, they learned novel words in Korean, a language with which they had no prior experience. All participants learned one set of novel words on Day 1 and another set on Day 2. An explicit recognition task and an implicit primed lexical-decision task were employed to measure sleep-dependent consolidation effects from the two environments. Results revealed sleep-dependent consolidation effects in both explicit and implicit measures, but only the primed lexical-decision task showed an influence of learning environment, suggesting that novel words learned via VR had better consolidation. Taken together, our findings suggest that a VR environment that fosters a rich sensory experience facilitates sleep-dependent consolidation effects. We argue that these results provide new evidence and implications for the complementary learning system (CLS) model.",

Exosomes transport diverse molecules, including proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA, and regulate distant intercellular communication. Noncoding RNA (ncRNAs) carried by exosomes regulate cell-cell communication in tissues, including adipose tissue. This review summarizes the action mechanisms of ncRNAs carried by exosomes on adipocyte differentiation and modulation of adipogenesis by exosomal ncRNAs.

        "Abstract": "How the locus-specificity of epigenetic modifications is regulated remains an unanswered question. A contributing mechanism is that epigenetic enzymes are recruited to specific loci by DNA binding factors recognizing particular sequence motifs (referred to as epi-motifs). Using these motifs to predict biological outputs depending on local epigenetic state such as somatic mutation rates would confirm their functionality. Here, we used DNA motifs including known TF motifs and epi-motifs as a surrogate of epigenetic signals to predict somatic mutation rates in 13 cancers at an average 23kbp resolution. We implemented an interpretable neural network model, called contextual regression, to successfully learn the universal relationship between mutations and DNA motifs, and uncovered motifs that are most impactful on the regional mutation rates such as TP53 and epi-motifs associated with H3K9me3. Furthermore, we identified genomic regions with significantly higher mutation rates than the expected values in each individual tumor and demonstrated that such cancer-related regions can accurately predict cancer types. Interestingly, we found that the same mutation signatures often have different contributions to cancer-related and cancer-independent regions, and we also identified the motifs with the most contribution to each mutation signature.",

        "Abstract": "Active sampling is a dependable approach for gaseous pollutants monitoring, offering high accuracy and precision that is unaffected by environmental factors such as wind and temperature in comparison to passive sampling. To measure long-term average concentrations while minimizing the use of materials, a reduced sampling rate is necessary. Thus, this study aims to develop a novel low sampling rate (down to 1 mL/min) and cost-efficient active sampler (LASP) for medium/long-term monitoring of gaseous pollutants. The LASP mainly consisted of a syringe pump, a Y-shaped fitting with two one-way valves, and a control unit for intermittent operation. Results showed that LASP can obtain a sampling rate of less than 1 mL/min and sampling rate exhibited a high level of stability. Daily average concentrations measurements for nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde by LASP had normalized mean biases of 2.8% and 5.2%, respectively. These numbers were - 5.8% and 6.1% for weekly-average samplings. This study demonstrated applications of LASP in real outdoor (daily-average) and indoor (weekly-average) air quality measurements. It worked well with low noise levels, and without interfering with occupants' daily activities. LASP can assist in improving our ability to monitor air quality and pollutants emissions, thereby supporting health research and policy development. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION: Gaseous air pollution is an important hazardous factor threatening human health. Medium/long-term air quality monitoring is essential for outdoor and indoor air quality assessment and control. However, air sampler for medium/long-term sampling is lacking. This study developed a novel low sampling rate and cost-efficient active sampler and applied it to medium/long-term air sampling. The sampler can work at a sampling rate of less than 1 mL/min. This technology provides a feasible strategy for medium/long-term monitoring of gaseous air pollutants in both environments and emission hotspots.",

Our strategy creates a unique interconnected network of strongly-coupled donor 3-(acceptor-core) octupoles in Cyano-OCF-EO, affording enhanced intramolecular charge transfer, substantial active sites and crowded open channels. This enables Cyano-OCF-EO as a new versatile separator modifier, which endows the modified separator with superior catalytic activity for sulfur conversion and rapid Li ion conduction with the high Li",

        "Abstract": "Hypertensive myocardial hypertrophy produces a hostile microenvironment characterized by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, inflammation and oxidative stress, which also leads to endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) dysfunction, preventing EPC migration, adhesion and angiogenesis. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an intracellular protein that plays an important role in angiogenesis and cell survival. The upregulation of cAMP response element-binding protein 3 (CREB3) is closely related to the formation of endothelial cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of HO-1 and CREB3 in EPCs and their effects on hypertensive myocardial hypertrophy. EPCs were transfected with HO-1 adenoviral overexpression vector (Ad-HO-1) or together with CREB3 siRNA (si-CREB3), or transfected with CREB3 adenoviral overexpression vector (Ad-CREB3) or together with HO-1 siRNA, and then treated with 100 nM Ang Ⅱ for 12 h. Overexpressing HO-1 or CREB3 promoted adhesion to extracellular matrix, cell migration, and angiogenesis, inhibited the secretion of inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-6, and reduced ROS level, ICAM-1 and MCP-1 mRNA expression levels in EPCs treated with Ang Ⅱ. Online prediction and Co-IP assay showed that HO-1 interacts with CREB3, and they promote expression of each other. EPC-conditioned medium supplemented with CREB3 recombinant protein decreased the levels of ANP and BNP mRNA in H9C2 cells treated with Ang Ⅱ and alleviated oxidative stress. Ad-CREB3 transfected EPCs promoted the phosphorylation of AKT in vivo and in vitro, thereby improving myocardial swelling and dysfunction in SHR rats. Taken together, transplantation of CREB3 overexpressing EPCs alleviates myocardial hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats by promoting HO-1 protein expression and AKT phosphorylation.",

We then discuss pivotal factors that contribute to the assortment of fibril structural polymorphs, including post-translational modifications (PTMs), disease mutations, and interacting molecules, and elucidate the structural basis of how these determinants influence amyloid fibril polymorphism. Furthermore, we underscore the need for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between diverse fibril polymorphs and pathological activities, as well as their potential roles in therapeutic applications.",

Here, we report for the first time an intrinsic strain-mediated ultrathin ceria nanoantioxidant. Surface strain in ceria with variable thicknesses and coordinatively unsaturated Ce sites was investigated by theoretical calculation analysis and then was validated by preparing ∼1.2 nm ultrathin nanoplates with ∼3.0% tensile strain in plane/∼10.0% tensile strain out of plane. Compared with nanocubes, surface strain in ultrathin nanoplates could enhance the covalency of the Ce-O bond, leading to increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD)-mimetic activity by ∼2.6-fold (1533 U/mg, in close proximity to that of natural SOD) and total antioxidant activity by ∼2.5-fold. As a proof of concept, intrinsic strain-mediated ultrathin ceria nanoplates could boost antioxidation for improved ischemic stroke treatment ",

        "Abstract": "Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, exhibits an extremely large electronic band gap of about 20 eV at ambient pressures. While the metallization pressure of helium has been accurately determined, thus far little attention has been paid to the specific mechanisms driving the band-gap closure and electronic properties of this quantum crystal in the terapascal regime (1 TPa = 10 Mbar). Here, we employ density functional theory and many-body perturbation calculations to fill up this knowledge gap. It is found that prior to reaching metallicity helium becomes an excitonic insulator (EI), an exotic state of matter in which electrostatically bound electron-hole pairs may form spontaneously. Furthermore, we predict metallic helium to be a superconductor with a critical temperature of ≈ 20 K just above its metallization pressure and of ≈ 70 K at 100 TPa. These unforeseen phenomena may be critical for improving our fundamental understanding and modeling of celestial bodies.",

        "Title": "Cadmium exposure promotes ferroptosis by upregulating Heat Shock Protein 70 in vascular endothelial damage of zebrafish.",
        "Abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) exposure is a risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. Ferroptosis is a type of cell death that relies on lipid peroxidation. Whether ferroptosis acts in Cd-induced vascular endothelial damage and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we found that Cd resulted in ferroptosis of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in vivo and in vitro. In the visualized zebrafish embryos, Cd accumulated in vascular ECs, ROS and lipid peroxidation levels were increased, and the oxidoreductase system was disturbed after exposure. Moreover, Cd decreased Gpx4 in ECs and caused smaller mitochondria with increased membrane density. Accompanied by ferroptosis, the number of ECs and the area of the caudal venous plexus in zebrafish embryos were reduced, and the survival rate of HUVECs decreased. These effects were partially reversed by ferrostatin-1 and aggravated by erastin. Mechanistically, an excessive increase in Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70) was identified by transcriptomics after Cd exposure. Inhibition of Hsp70 by VER-155008 or siRNA ameliorated Cd-induced ferroptosis, thereby alleviating endothelial injury. Furthermore, Hsp70 regulated Cd-induced ferroptosis by targeting multiple targets, including Gpx4, Fth1, Nrf2 and Acsl4. Our findings provide a new approach to investigating the endothelial damage of Cd and indicate that regulation of Hsp70 is an important target for alleviating this process.",

        "Abstract": "Determination of antipsychotics from biological samples is meaningful in the field of clinical and forensic medicine. Compared to blood, keratinized matrices such as hair and nails have attracted increasing attention in drug analysis for wider detection window. Nevertheless, the distribution and stability of antipsychotics in keratinized matrices are not clarified yet. Therefore, we developed a LC-MS/MS based method for simultaneous determination of 10 antipsychotics from blood, hair and nails, with high recovery (78.1-107.4%, 71.3-93.5% and 75.2-90.5%), low LOD (5-10 pg/mL, 5-10 pg/mg and 5 pg/mg) and high accuracy (96.0%-101.6%, 97.5%-102.5% and 97.6-101.7%). The method was applied to sets of blood, hair, and nail samples of 54 patients who received long-term therapy, and significant correlations between drug concentrations in blood and hair was found, while the correlation between nails and other matrices varied depending on the drug. Except for olanzapine, the concentrations of antipsychotics in segmental hair samples were consistent with drug exposure. Besides, the hair and nail samples of suspects in two forensic cases were analyzed and provided supporting evidence for the suspects' psychiatric state. Our research offered a deeper understanding of keratinized matrix as stable and retrospective bio-samples for antipsychotics detection in forensic practice.",

        "Abstract": "Amyloid fibril is an important pharmaceutical target for diagnostic and therapeutic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, rational design of chemical compounds that interact with amyloid fibrils is unachievable due to the lack of mechanistic understanding of the ligand-fibril interaction. Here we used cryoelectron microscopy to survey the amyloid fibril-binding mechanism of a series of compounds including classic dyes, (pre)clinical imaging tracers and newly identified binders from high-throughput screening. We obtained clear densities of several compounds in complex with an α-synuclein fibril. These structures unveil the basic mechanism of the ligand-fibril interaction, which exhibits remarkable difference from the canonical ligand-protein interaction. In addition, we discovered a druggable pocket that is also conserved in the ex vivo α-synuclein fibrils from multiple system atrophy. Collectively, these findings expand our knowledge of protein-ligand interaction in the amyloid fibril state, which will enable rational design of amyloid binders in a medicinally beneficial way.",

        "Abstract": "The quasi-static temperature and dynamic acoustic signals based on ultra-weak chirped fiber Bragg grating (CFBG) array is proposed and experimentally demonstrated, which can be employed to detect distributed acoustic and temperature signals simultaneously. Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) was realized by cross-correlation operation to measure the spectral drift of each CFBG, and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) was achieved by gauging the phase difference between adjacent CFBG. Using CFBG as the sensor unit can protect acoustic signals from the fluctuations and drifts induced by temperature change without deterioration of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Applying least square mean adaptive filter (AF) can enhance harmonic frequency suppression ratio and increase the SNR of system. In the proof-of-concept experiment the SNR of acoustic signal is higher than 100 dB after the digital filter and frequency response is from 2 Hz to 1.25 kHz with repetition frequency of laser pulses of 10 kHz. Temperature measurement from 30°C to 100°C is achieved with demodulation accuracy of ±0.8°C. The spatial resolution (SR) of two-parameter sensing is 5 m.",

        "Title": "Rational design of functional amyloid fibrillar assemblies.",
        "Abstract": "Amyloid fibrillar assemblies, originally identified as pathological entities in neurodegenerative diseases, have been widely adopted by various proteins to fulfill diverse biological functions in living organisms. Due to their unique features, such as hierarchical assembly, exceptional mechanical properties, environmental stability, and self-healing properties, amyloid fibrillar assemblies have been employed as functional materials in numerous applications. Recently, with the rapid advancement in synthetic biology and structural biology tools, new trends in the functional design of amyloid fibrillar assemblies have begun to emerge. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the design principles for functional amyloid fibrillar assemblies from an engineering perspective, as well as through the lens of structural insights. Initially, we introduce the fundamental structural configurations of amyloid assemblies and highlight the functions of representative examples. We then focus on the underlying design principles of two prevalent strategies for the design of functional amyloid fibrillar assemblies: (1) introducing new functions ",

        "Title": "Rhein protects retinal Müller cells from high glucose-induced injury via activating the AMPK/Sirt1/PGC-1α pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis are important pathogenic factors of diabetic retinopathy (DR). In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the potential role of Rhein, a natural anthraquinone compound found in rhubarb, in high glucose (HG)-induced Müller cells (MIO-M1). Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay, TUNEL assay, Western blot analysis, Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and ELISA were conducted to assess the effects of Rhein on Müller cells. Additionally, the EX-527, an Sirt1 inhibitor, was used to study whether the effects of Rhein, on HG-induced Müller cells were mediated by activation of the Sirt1 signaling pathway. Our data showed that Rhein improved cell viability of HG-induced Müller cells. Rhein reduced the ROS and MDA production and increased the activities of SOD and CAT in Müller cells in response to HG stimulation. Rhein decreased the production of VEGF, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Moreover, Rhein attenuated HG-induced apoptosis, evidenced by increase in Bcl-2 level and decreases in the Bax, caspase-3 expression. It was also found that EX-527 counteracted Rhein-mediated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptosis effects on Müller cells. The protein levels of p-AMPK and PGC-1α were also upregulated by Rhein. In conclusion, these findings support that Rhein may ameliorate HG-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and protect against mitochondrial dysfunction by the activation of the AMPK/Sirt1/PGC-1α signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Catalase (CAT) is often phosphorylated and activated by protein kinases to maintain hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) homeostasis and protect cells against stresses, but whether and how CAT is switched off by protein phosphatases remains inconclusive. Here, we identified a manganese (Mn2+)-dependent protein phosphatase, which we named PHOSPHATASE OF CATALASE 1 (PC1), from rice (Oryza sativa L.) that negatively regulates salt and oxidative stress tolerance. PC1 specifically dephosphorylates CatC at Ser-9 to inhibit its tetramerization and thus activity in the peroxisome. PC1 overexpressing lines exhibited hypersensitivity to salt and oxidative stresses with a lower phospho-serine level of CATs. Phosphatase activity and seminal root growth assays indicated that PC1 promotes growth and plays a vital role during the transition from salt stress to normal growth conditions. Our findings demonstrate that PC1 acts as a molecular switch to dephosphorylate and deactivate CatC and negatively regulate H2O2 homeostasis and salt tolerance in rice. Moreover, knockout of PC1 not only improved H2O2-scavenging capacity and salt tolerance but also limited rice grain yield loss under salt stress conditions. Together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that switch off CAT and provide a strategy for breeding highly salt-tolerant rice.",

        "Title": "Effect of forest soil viruses on bacterial community succession and the implication for soil carbon sequestration.",
        "Abstract": "Although the ecological importance of soil viruses is increasingly recognized, how soil viruses regulate the diversity, structure and succession of microbial communities has not been well understood. Here, we conducted an incubation experiment by mixing soil viruses and bacteria in different ratios, and tracked the changes in viral and bacterial cell abundances as well as bacterial community composition. Our results revealed that viral predation predominantly targeted host lineages that are r-strategists and was a key regulator of the succession of bacterial communities. Viral lysis markedly enhanced production of insoluble particulate organic matter, hence potentially contributing to carbon sequestration. In addition, treatment with mitomycin C led to significant shift in virus to bacteria ratio, and revealed bacterial lineages sensitive to lysogenic-lytic conversion, e.g., Burkholderiaceae in particular, indicating effect of prophage induction on bacterial community succession. Soil viruses also promoted homogeneous selection of the bacterial communities, suggesting the role of viruses in influencing bacterial community assembly mechanisms. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence of the top-down control exerted by viruses on soil bacterial communities and expanded knowledge about the associated regulatory mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Despite advancements in medical research, androgenetic alopecia (AGA) remains a humankind problem that still needs to be overcome. To date, clinical practice lacks an ideal treatment for AGA. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is evidenced to play a key role in hair regrowth, hence, modulating this signaling pathway for AGA therapy appears to be rational. One of the major inhibitors of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1). In this report, we have selected a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting DKK1 in vitro via qPCR and then tested its efficacy in vivo on the depilated dorsal skin of the mice. The changes in hair growth in different groups were observed over time. Moreover, the visual observation of the hair growth and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining showed that DKK1-targeting siRNA reveals non-inferior results compared with the mice treated with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, commercially available minoxidil (5%) topical solution that was used as a positive control. Both- positive control and DKK1-targeting siRNA groups demonstrated significantly superior results compared with the control group that received negative control siRNA. Consequently, siRNAs targeting DKK1 may promote hair growth regulation in the AGA population via potentially activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a leading cause of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The multidrug-resistance (MDR) rate of PA is increasing making the management of PA a global challenge. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines represent the most promising alternative to conventional vaccines and are widely studied for viral infection and cancer immunotherapy while rarely studied for bacterial infections. In this study, two mRNA vaccines encoding PcrV- the key component of the type III secretion system in Pseudomonas and the fusion protein OprF-I comprising outer membrane proteins OprF and OprI were constructed. The mice were immunized with either one of these mRNA vaccines or with the combination of both. Additionally, mice were vaccinated with PcrV, OprF, or the combination of these two proteins. Immunization with either mRNA-PcrV or mRNA-OprF-I elicited a Th1/Th2 mixed or slighted Th1-biased immune response, conferred broad protection, and reduced bacterial burden and inflammation in burn and systemic infection models. mRNA-PcrV induced significantly stronger antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and higher survival rate compared with the OprF-I after challenging with all the PA strains tested. The combined mRNA vaccine demonstrated the best survival rate. Moreover, the mRNA vaccines showed the superiority over protein vaccines. These results suggest that mRNA-PcrV as well as the mixture of mRNA-PcrV and mRNA-OprF-I are promising vaccine candidates for the prevention of PA infection.",

        "Abstract": "The subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is an important cause of death and long-term disability worldwide. As a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase, silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) is a multipotent molecule involved in many pathophysiological processes. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that Sirt1 activation may exert positive effects on SAHs by regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis. Thus, Sirt1 agonists may serve as potential therapeutic drugs for SAHs. In this review, we summarized the current state of our knowledge on the relationship between Sirt1 and SAHs and provided an updated overview of the downstream molecules of Sirt1 in SAHs.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that O-glycosylation plays crucial and multifaceted roles in modulating protein amyloid aggregation and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) under physiological conditions. Dysregulation of these processes is closely associated with human diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and cancers. In this review, we first summarize the distinct roles of O-glycosylation in regulating pathological aggregation of different amyloid proteins related to NDs and elaborate the underlying mechanisms of how O-glycosylation modulates protein aggregation kinetics, induces new aggregated structures, and mediates the pathogenesis of amyloid aggregates under diseased conditions. Furthermore, we introduce recent discoveries on O-GlcNAc-mediated regulation of synaptic LLPS and phase separation potency of low-complexity domain-enriched proteins. Finally, we identify challenges in future research and highlight the potential for developing new therapeutic strategies of NDs by targeting protein O-glycosylation.",

        "Abstract": "Cytochrome P450s (CYPs), as one of the most diverse enzyme superfamilies in nature, play critical functions in antioxidant reactions against endogenous and exogenous compounds. In this study, we performed genome-wide characterization of CYP superfamily members and analyzed their expression patterns under several abiotic stresses in spotted sea bass, which is known as an economically important fish species in the Chinese aquaculture industry. A total of 55 CYP genes were identified and divided into 17 families within 10 clans. The analysis of phylogeny, gene structure, and syntenic relationships provided evidence for the evolution of CYP genes and confirmed their annotation and orthology. The expression of CYP genes was examined in the liver during trichlorfon stress using quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that 20 tested CYP genes displayed significant mRNA expression changes, indicating that they may play crucial roles in the metabolism of trichlorfon and can be potential biomarkers for trichlorfon pollution. Moreover, by screening transcriptomic databases, 10, 3 and 19 CYP genes exhibited differential expression patterns in response to hypoxia, alkalinity and heat stress, respectively. Taken together, this study provided insights into the regulation of CYP genes by toxicological and environmental stresses, laid basis for extensive functional studies of the CYP superfamily in spotted sea bass and other teleost species.",

        "Abstract": "Paraquat (PQ) is the most widely used herbicide in agriculture worldwide and has been considered a high-risk environmental factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Chronic PQ exposure selectively induces dopaminergic neuron loss, the hallmark pathologic feature of PD, resulting in Parkinson-like movement disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that repetitive PQ exposure caused dopaminergic neuron loss, dopamine deficiency and motor deficits dose-dependently in mice. Accordingly, mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) was highly expressed in PQ-exposed mice and neuronal cells. Importantly, MCU knockout (KO) effectively rescued PQ-induced dopaminergic neuron loss and motor deficits in mice. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of MCU alleviated PQ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death in vitro. Mechanistically, PQ exposure triggered mitochondrial fragmentation via imbalance of the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) processing manifested by cleavage of L-OPA1 to S-OPA1, which was reversed by inhibition of MCU. Notably, the upregulation of MCU was mediated by miR-129-1-3p posttranscriptionally, and overexpression of miR-129-1-3p could rebalance OPA1 processing and attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death induced by PQ exposure. Consequently, our work uncovers an essential role of MCU and a novel molecular mechanism, miR-MCU-OPA1, in PQ-induced pathogenesis of PD, providing a potential target and strategy for environmental neurotoxins-induced PD treatment.",

        "Title": "Ultrasonic tweezer for multifunctional droplet manipulation.",
        "Abstract": "Spatiotemporally controllable droplet manipulation is essential in diverse applications, ranging from thermal management to microfluidics and water harvesting. Despite considerable advances, droplet manipulation without surface or droplet pretreatment is still challenging in terms of response and functional adaptability. Here, a droplet ultrasonic tweezer (DUT) based on phased array is proposed for versatile droplet manipulation. The DUT can generate a twin trap ultrasonic field at the focal point for trapping and maneuvering the droplet by changing the position of the focal point, which enables a highly flexible and precise programmable control. By leveraging the acoustic radiation force resulting from the twin trap, the droplet can pass through a confined slit 2.5 times smaller than its own size, cross a slope with an inclination up to 80°, and even reciprocate in the vertical direction. These findings provide a satisfactory paradigm for robust contactless droplet manipulation in various practical settings including droplet ballistic ejection, droplet dispensing, and surface cleaning.",

        "Title": "Extreme-Low-Speed Heavy Load Bearing Fault Diagnosis by Using Improved RepVGG and Acoustic Emission Signals.",
        "Abstract": "With the worldwide carbon neutralization boom, low-speed heavy load bearings have been widely used in the field of wind power. Bearing failure generates impulses when the rolling element passes the cracked surface of the bearing. Over the past decade, acoustic emission (AE) techniques have been used to detect failure signals. However, the high sampling rates of AE signals make it difficult to design and extract fault features; thus, deep neural network-based approaches have been proposed. In this paper, we proposed an improved RepVGG bearing fault diagnosis technique. The normalized and noise-reduced bearing signals were first converted into Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) and then inputted into the model. In addition, the exponential moving average method was used to optimize the model and improve its accuracy. Data were extracted from the test bench and wind turbine main shaft bearing. Four damage classes were studied experimentally. The experimental results demonstrated that the improved RepVGG model could be employed for classifying low-speed heavy load bearing states by using MFCCs. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed model was assessed by performing comparisons with existing models.",

        "Abstract": "Much progress has been made toward generating analogs of early embryos, such as gastruloids and embryoids, in vitro. However, methods for how to fully mimic the cell movements of gastrulation and coordinate germ-layer patterning to induce head formation are still lacking. Here, we show that a regional Nodal gradient applied to zebrafish animal pole explant can generate a structure that recapitulates the key cell movements of gastrulation. Using single-cell transcriptome and in situ hybridization analysis, we assess the dynamics of the cell fates and patterning of this structure. The mesendoderm differentiates into the anterior endoderm, prechordal plate, notochord, and tailbud-like cells along an anterior-posterior axis, and an anterior-posterior-patterned head-like structure (HLS) progressively forms during late gastrulation. Among 105 immediate Nodal targets, 14 genes contain axis-induction ability, and 5 of them induce a complete or partial head structure when overexpressed in the ventral side of zebrafish embryos.",

        "Abstract": "High-throughput screening (HTS) methods enable the empirical evaluation of a large scale of compounds and can be augmented by virtual screening (VS) techniques to save time and money by using potential active compounds for experimental testing. Structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening approaches have been extensively studied and applied in drug discovery practice with proven outcomes in advancing candidate molecules. However, the experimental data required for VS are expensive, and hit identification in an effective and efficient manner is particularly challenging during early-stage drug discovery for novel protein targets. Herein, we present our TArget-driven Machine learning-Enabled VS (TAME-VS) platform, which leverages existing chemical databases of bioactive molecules to modularly facilitate hit finding. Our methodology enables bespoke hit identification campaigns through a user-defined protein target. The input target ID is used to perform a homology-based target expansion, followed by compound retrieval from a large compilation of molecules with experimentally validated activity. Compounds are subsequently vectorized and adopted for machine learning (ML) model training. These machine learning models are deployed to perform model-based inferential virtual screening, and compounds are nominated based on predicted activity. Our platform was retrospectively validated across ten diverse protein targets and demonstrated clear predictive power. The implemented methodology provides a flexible and efficient approach that is accessible to a wide range of users. The TAME-VS platform is publicly available at https://github.com/bymgood/Target-driven-ML-enabled-VS to facilitate early-stage hit identification.",

        "Abstract": "The effective protection and utilization of poultry resources depend on an accurate understanding of the genetic diversity and population structure. The breeding of the specialized poultry lineage \"Yufen 1\", with its defined characteristics, was approved by the China Poultry Genetic Resource Committee in 2015. Thus, to investigate the relationship between the progenitor H line and other poultry breeds, the genetic diversity and population structure of \"Yufen 1\" H line (YF) were investigated and compared with those of 2 commercial chicken breeds, the ancestor breed Red Jungle Fowls, and 11 Chinese indigenous chicken breeds based on a whole-genome resequencing approach using 8,112,424 SNPs. The genetic diversity of YF was low, and the rate of linkage disequilibrium decay was significantly slower than that of the other Chinese indigenous breeds. In addition, it was shown that the YF population was strongly selected during intensive breeding and that genetic resources have been seriously threatened, which highlights the need to establish a systematic conservation strategy as well as utilization techniques to maintain genetic diversity within YF. Moreover, a principal component analysis, a neighbor-joining tree analysis, a structure analysis, and genetic differentiation indices indicated that YF harbors a distinctive genetic resource with a unique genetic structure separate from that of Chinese indigenous breeds at the genome level. The findings provide a valuable resource and the theoretical basis for the further conservation and utilization of YF.",

        "Abstract": "Few studies have examined the link between short-term exposure to air pollutants and atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes. This study aims to examine the association of hourly criteria air pollutants with AF episodes. We employ a smart device-based photoplethysmography technology to screen AF from 2018 to 2021. Hourly concentrations of six criteria air pollutants are matched to the onset hour of AF for each participant. We adopt a time-stratified case-crossover design to capture the acute effects of air pollutants on AF episodes, using conditional logistic regression models. Subgroup analyses are conducted by age, gender, and season. A total of 11,906 episodes of AF are identified in 2976 participants from 288 Chinese cities. Generally, the strongest associations of air pollutants are present at lag 18-24 h, with positive and linear exposure-response relationships. For an interquartile range increase in inhalable particles, fine particles, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide, the odds ratio (OR) of AF is 1.19 [95% confidential interval (CI): 1.03, 1.37], 1.38 (95%CI: 1.14, 1.67), 1.60 (95%CI: 1.16, 2.20) and 1.48 (95%CI: 1.19, 1.84), respectively. The estimates are robust to the adjustment of co-pollutants, and they are larger in females, older people, and in cold seasons. There are insignificant associations for sulfur dioxide and ozone. This nationwide case-crossover study demonstrates robust evidence of significant associations between hourly exposure to air pollutants and the onset of AF episodes, which underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to further improve air quality as an effective target for AF prevention.",

        "Abstract": "Microglia are the primary source of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) in the brain; however, the roles of microglial TGM2 in neural development and disease are still not well known. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role and mechanisms of microglial TGM2 in the brain. A mouse line with a specific knockout of Tgm2 in microglia was generated. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot and qRT-PCR assays were performed to evaluate the expression levels of TGM2, PSD-95 and CD68. Confocal imaging, immunofluorescence staining and behavioural analyses were conducted to identify phenotypes of microglial TGM2 deficiency. Finally, RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR and co-culture of neurons and microglia were used to explore the potential mechanisms. Deletion of microglial Tgm2 causes impaired synaptic pruning, reduced anxiety and increased cognitive deficits in mice. At the molecular level, the phagocytic genes, such as Cq1a, C1qb and Tim4, are significantly down-regulated in TGM2-deficient microglia. This study elucidates a novel role of microglial TGM2 in regulating synaptic remodelling and cognitive function, indicating that microglia Tgm2 is essential for proper neural development.",

        "Abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the commonly used delivery tools for messenger RNA (mRNA) therapy and play an indispensable role in the success of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Ionizable cationic lipids are the most important component in LNPs. Herein, we developed a series of new ionizable lipids featuring bioreducible disulfide bonds, and constructed a library of lipids derived from dimercaprol. LNPs prepared from these ionizable lipids could be stored at 4 °C for a long term and are non-toxic toward HepG2 and 293T cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the best C4S18A formulations, which embody linoleoyl tails, show strong firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA expression in the liver and spleen via intravenous (IV) injection, or at the local injection site via intramuscular injection (IM). The newly designed ionizable lipids can be potentially safe and high-efficiency nanomaterials for mRNA therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Traumatic brain injury usually results in neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. Promoting endogenous neurogenesis has been considered as a viable treatment option to improve functional recovery after TBI. However, neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in neurogenic regions are often unable to migrate and differentiate into mature neurons at the injury site. Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) has been identified as a crucial component of neurogenic niche, and significantly dysregulated after TBI. Therefore, we speculate that TGM2 may play an important role in neurogenesis after TBI, and strategies targeting TGM2 to promote endogenous neural regeneration may be applied in TBI therapy.

        "Title": "β subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels in cardiovascular diseases.",
        "Abstract": "Calcium signaling is required in bodily functions essential for survival, such as muscle contractions and neuronal communications. Of note, the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) expressed on muscle and neuronal cells, as well as some endocrine cells, are transmembrane protein complexes that allow for the selective entry of calcium ions into the cells. The α1 subunit constitutes the main pore-forming subunit that opens in response to membrane depolarization, and its biophysical functions are regulated by various auxiliary subunits-β, α2δ, and γ subunits. Within the cardiovascular system, the γ-subunit is not expressed and is therefore not discussed in this review. Because the α1 subunit is the pore-forming subunit, it is a prominent druggable target and the focus of many studies investigating potential therapeutic interventions for cardiovascular diseases. While this may be true, it should be noted that the direct inhibition of the α1 subunit may result in limited long-term cardiovascular benefits coupled with undesirable side effects, and that its expression and biophysical properties may depend largely on its auxiliary subunits. Indeed, the α2δ subunit has been reported to be essential for the membrane trafficking and expression of the α1 subunit. Furthermore, the β subunit not only prevents proteasomal degradation of the α1 subunit, but also directly modulates the biophysical properties of the α1 subunit, such as its voltage-dependent activities and open probabilities. More importantly, various isoforms of the β subunit have been found to differentially modulate the α1 subunit, and post-translational modifications of the β subunits further add to this complexity. These data suggest the possibility of the β subunit as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. However, emerging studies have reported the presence of cardiomyocyte membrane α1 subunit trafficking and expression in a β subunit-independent manner, which would undermine the efficacy of β subunit-targeting drugs. Nevertheless, a better understanding of the auxiliary β subunit would provide a more holistic approach when targeting the calcium channel complexes in treating cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, this review focuses on the post-translational modifications of the β subunit, as well as its role as an auxiliary subunit in modulating the calcium channel complexes.",

        "Abstract": "Short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate, have multiple metabolic benefits in individuals who are lean but not in individuals with metabolic syndrome, with the underlying mechanisms still being unclear. We aimed to investigate the role of gut microbiota in the induction of metabolic benefits of dietary butyrate. We performed antibiotic-induced microbiota depletion of the gut and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, a well-established translational model for developing human-like metabolic syndrome, and revealed that dietary butyrate reduced appetite and ameliorated high-fat diet-induced (HFD-induced) weight gain dependent on the presence of gut microbiota. FMT from butyrate-treated lean donor mice, but not butyrate-treated obese donor mice, into gut microbiota-depleted recipient mice reduced food intake, attenuated HFD-induced weight gain, and improved insulin resistance. 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing on cecal bacterial DNA of recipient mice implied that these effects were accompanied by the selective proliferation of Lachnospiraceae bacterium 28-4 in the gut as induced by butyrate. Collectively, our findings reveal a crucial role of gut microbiota in the beneficial metabolic effects of dietary butyrate as strongly associated with the abundance of Lachnospiraceae bacterium 28-4.",

        "Abstract": "Single-atom catalysts with structure and activity tunability have attracted significant attention for energy and environmental applications. Herein we present a first-principles study of single-atom catalysis on two-dimensional graphene and electride heterostructures. The anion electron gas in the electride layer enables a colossal electron transfer to the graphene layer, with the degree of transfer being controllable by the selection of electride. The charge transfer tunes the d-orbital electron occupancy of a single metal atom, enhancing the catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen reduction reactions. The strong correlation between the adsorption energy ",

        "Abstract": "Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease, but its pathogenesis remains unclear. There are few review articles on GO research from the perspective of target cells and target antigens. A systematic search of PubMed was performed, focusing mainly on studies published after 2015 that involve the role of target cells, orbital fibroblasts (OFs) and orbital adipocytes (OAs), target antigens, thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and their corresponding antibodies, TSHR antibodies (TRAbs) and IGF-1R antibodies (IGF-1R Abs), in GO pathogenesis and the potentially effective therapies that target TSHR and IGF-1R. Based on the results, OFs may be derived from bone marrow-derived CD34+ fibrocytes. In addition to CD34+ OFs, CD34- OFs are important in the pathogenesis of GO and may be involved in hyaluronan formation. CD34- OFs expressing Slit2 suppress the phenotype of CD34+ OFs. β-arrestin 1 can be involved in TSHR/IGF-1R crosstalk as a scaffold. Research on TRAbs has gradually shifted to TSAbs, TBAbs and the titre of TRAbs. However, the existence and role of IGF-1R Abs are still unknown and deserve further study. Basic and clinical trials of TSHR-inhibiting therapies are increasing, and TSHR is an expected therapeutic target. Teprotumumab has become the latest second-line treatment for GO. This review aims to effectively describe the pathogenesis of GO from the perspective of target cells and target antigens and provide ideas for its fundamental treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Results show that the astrocytes can not only listen to the talk of large assemble of neurons but also give advice to the conversations and are significant sources of heterogeneous couplings as well. In the present work, we focus on such regulation character of astrocytes and explore the role of heterogeneous couplings among interacted neuron-astrocyte components in a signal response. We consider reduced dynamics in which the listening and advising processes of astrocytes are mapped into the form of group coupling, where the couplings are normally distributed. In both globally coupled overdamped bistable oscillators and an excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron model, we numerically and analytically demonstrate that two types of bell-shaped collective response curves can be obtained as the ensemble coupling strength or the heterogeneity of group coupling rise, respectively, which can be seen as a new type of double resonance. Furthermore, through the bifurcation analysis, we verify that these resonant signal responses stem from the competition between dispersion and aggregation induced by heterogeneous group and positive pairwise couplings, respectively. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the signal propagation in coupled systems with quenched disorder.",

        "Abstract": "The manipulation of droplets plays a vital role in fundamental research and practical applications, from chemical reactions to bioanalysis. As an intriguing and active format, light control of droplets, typically induced by photochemistry, photomechanics, light-induced Marangoni effects or light-induced electric fields, enables remote and contactless control with remarkable spatial and temporal accuracy. However, current light control of droplets suffers from poor performance and limited reliability. Here we develop a new superamphiphobic material that integrates the dual merits of light and electric field by rationally preparing liquid metal particles/poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) polymer composites with photo-induced charge generation capability in real time, enabling light control of droplets on the basis of photo-induced dielectrophoretic force. We demonstrate that this photo-induced charged surface (PICS) imparts a new paradigm for controllable droplet motion, including high average velocity (∼35.9 mm s",

        "Abstract": "Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) and digital image correlation (DIC) are widely applied in three-dimensional (3D) measurements. The combination of DIC and FPP can effectively overcome their respective shortcomings. However, the speckle on the surface of an object seriously affects the quality and modulation of fringe images captured by cameras, which will lead to non-negligible errors in the measurement results. In this paper, we propose a fringe image extraction method based on deep learning technology, which transforms speckle-embedded fringe images into speckle-free fringe images. The principle of the proposed method, 3D coordinate calculation, and deformation measurements are introduced. Compared with the traditional 3D-DIC method, the experimental results show that this method is effective and precise.",

        "Abstract": "This study aims to explore how pandemic-related media use relates to both protective and overprotective behaviors and to probe the underlying mechanisms. The data were collected online during the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China, and a total of 1118 valid cases, which covered the 30 provincial administrative divisions in mainland China, were collected. Results showed that official government media use was positively associated with protective behaviors and institutional trust was an important mediator. Commercial media use was also found to be positively associated with overprotective behavior, and anxiety mediated this relationship. Findings of this study suggested that different media sources could play completely different roles. Institutional trust in government institutions and medical care systems were equally critical in translating the media effect into public compliance with the preventive measures advocated by the relevant departments. Media outlets and practitioners should also be responsible in order to avoid causing unnecessary anxiety among the public so as to reduce irrational overprotective behaviors.",

Many phosphosites have been identified in CAT, but their functions remained largely elusive. We functionally studied five phosphoserines (Ser-9, -10, -11, -18, and -205) of CatC in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Phospho-Ser-9 and - 11 and dephospho-Ser-18 promoted the enzymatic activity of CatC and enhanced oxidative and salt tolerance in yeast. Phosphorylation status of Ser-18 did not affect CatC peroxisomal targeting and stability, but dephospho-Ser-18 promoted CatC tetramerization to enhance its activity. Moreover, overexpression of dephospho-mimic form CatC",

        "Abstract": "Analogues of the hepatokine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) are in clinical development for type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) treatment. Although their glucose-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects have been largely unraveled, the mechanisms by which they alleviate liver injury have only been scarcely addressed. Here, we aimed to unveil the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of FGF21 on NASH using APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, a well-established model for human-like metabolic diseases. Liver-specific FGF21 overexpression was achieved in mice, followed by administration of a high-fat high-cholesterol diet for 23 weeks. FGF21 prevented hepatic lipotoxicity, accompanied by activation of thermogenic tissues and attenuation of adipose tissue inflammation, improvement of hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and upregulation of hepatic programs involved in fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol removal. Furthermore, FGF21 inhibited hepatic inflammation, as evidenced by reduced Kupffer cell (KC) activation, diminished monocyte infiltration, and lowered accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages. Moreover, FGF21 decreased lipid- and scar-associated macrophages, which correlated with less hepatic fibrosis as demonstrated by reduced collagen accumulation. Collectively, hepatic FGF21 overexpression limits hepatic lipotoxicity, inflammation, and fibrogenesis. Mechanistically, FGF21 blocks hepatic lipid influx and accumulation through combined endocrine and autocrine signaling, respectively, which prevents KC activation and lowers the presence of lipid- and scar-associated macrophages to inhibit fibrogenesis.",

To this end, this study investigated the association between soyfoods or soybean products consumption and psychological symptoms among Chinese university students and analyzed the association between them. A three-stage stratified whole-group sampling method was used to administer questionnaires on soyfoods or soybean products consumption and psychological symptoms to 7742 university students in China. Self-assessment questionnaires were also administered to confounding variables such as basic demographic information, family status, parental education, body mass index (BMI), and moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The chi-square test, one-way ANOVA, and logistic regression analysis were used to explore the association and differences between soyfoods or soybean products consumption and psychological symptoms. The proportion of Chinese university students' soyfoods or soybean products consumption in ≤one time/week, two-four times/week, and ≥five times/week were 38.81%, 40.24%, and 20.95%, respectively. University students' psychological symptoms problem detection rate was 16.22%. The detection rate of psychological symptoms was lower among university male students (14.75%) than female students (17.35%), and the difference was statistically significant (χ",

        "Title": "Ecological risk under the dual threat of heavy metals and antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli in swine-farming wastewater in Shandong Province, China.",
        "Abstract": "Mineral elements and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pollutants in livestock and poultry farms' wastewater are often sources of ecological and public health problems. To understand the heavy-metal pollution status and the characteristics of drug-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) in swine-farm wastewater in Shandong Province and to provide guidance for the rational use of mineral-element additives, common antibiotics, and quaternary ammonium compound disinfectants on swine farms, 10 mineral elements were measured and E. coli isolated from wastewater and its resistance to 29 commonly used antibiotics and resistance genes was determined. Finally, phylogenetic and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses was performed on E. coli. The results showed serious pollution from iron and zinc, with a comprehensive pollution index of 708.94 and 3.13, respectively. It is worth noting that average iron levels in 75% (12/16) of the districts exceed allowable limits. Multidrug-resistant E. coli were found in every city of the province. The E. coli isolated from swine-farm wastewater were mainly resistant to tetracyclines (95.3%), chloramphenicol (77.8%), and sulfonamides (62.2%), while antibiotic resistance genes for quinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, and β-lactams were all more than 60%. The clonal complex 10 (CC10) was prevalent, and ST10 and ST48 were dominant in E. coli isolates. Multidrug-resistant E. coli were widely distributed, with mainly A genotypes. However, the mechanism of the effect of iron on antibiotic resistance needs more study in this area. Thus, further strengthening the prevention and control of iron and zinc pollution and standardizing the use of antibiotics and mineral element additives in the swine industry are necessary.",

        "Abstract": "Island systems are known to harbor disproportionate amounts of geographically restricted biodiversity and to experience high rates of species loss, and they ultimately represent critical systems with significant conservation values. However, knowledge of the biodiversity value of insular systems remains highly fragmented and incomplete for many groups of organisms, especially insects. This gap limits our understanding of their global significance for biodiversity and inhibits prioritization for future exploration and conservation efforts. Here, we developed a new database to present current knowledge on ants on 2678 islands globally, based on nominal species, and provide information on their native or exotic status. In total, this database contains 7010 ant species (44.6% of the known global ant fauna) that have been recorded on islands globally from 449,232 records. In addition, this database identifies 108 large islands (area > 200 km",

        "Abstract": "Targeting integrin α7 (ITGA7) suppresses malignant progression of several types of cancer, including tongue squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, while the effect of its knockdown on cell function and its association with clinicopathological features in endometrial cancer (EC) is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate this issue. ITGA7 was knocked down by short-interfering (si)RNA in Ishikawa and RL95-2 cells followed by western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR assays. Subsequently, cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and expression levels of PI3K, phosphorylated (p-) PI3K, AKT and p-AKT were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8, TUNEL, Transwell assays and western blotting. Moreover, ITGA7 in tumor and adjacent tissues from 50 patients with endometrial cancer was detected using immunohistochemical assay. ITGA7 expression was increased in EC cell lines (HEC-1A, RL95-2, Ishikawa and KLE) compared with telomerase-immortalized human endometrial stromal cells (THESCs). In both Ishikawa and RL95-2 cells, three ITGA7 siRNAs all demonstrated good efficiency on ITGA7 knockdown, amongst which the one with the highest efficiency was selected for the following experiments. ITGA7 knockdown reduced cell proliferation and invasion, while inducing apoptosis; moreover, it suppressed p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT ratios. In patients with EC, ITGA7 expression was increased in tumor tissues compared with adjacent tissues, and its lower tumor expression was associated with myometrial invasion (<1/2), non-lymphovascular invasion and decreased FIGO stage. In conclusion, ITGA7 knockdown repressed proliferation, invasion and the PI3K/AKT pathway while inducing apoptosis in EC cell lines, and its insufficiency was associated with less advanced tumor features in EC patients. These results indicated that ITGA7 may be a potential target for the treatment of EC.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, many studies have shown that the gut microbiota can affect the occurrence and development of a variety of human diseases. A variety of skin diseases are related to the regulation of the gut-skin axis, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and acne. Gut microbial dysbiosis can promote the development of these diseases. The gut microbiota can affect estrogen metabolism, β-glucuronidase secreted by the gut microbiota can promote the reabsorption of estrogen by the gut, and estrogen is transported to other parts of the body through the circulatory system. The occurrence and development of melasma are closely related to abnormal metabolism of estrogen. The relationship between the structure of the gut microbiota and melasma remains unclear. Epidemiological surveys were conducted in patients with melasma and healthy subjects (control group) in this study. The feces were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing analysis of the gut microbiota. To compare the similarities and differences in species diversity of the gut microbiota between these two groups, we calculated the α-diversity and β-diversity indices and analyzed the differences between them. We found that the abundance of ",

        "Abstract": "Although yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) has been reported its functions of antiviral, antibacterial, energy balancing, and gut microbiota regulating, its gastrointestinal digestion process and the digestion products have not been studied, which is of great significance for the development of IgY-themed functional foods. This work investigated the digestion behaviors of oral IgY by static digestion simulation in vitro. IgY showed low digestibility (23.97%) in the gastric phase but was highly digestible (89.49% digestibility) in the initial intestinal phase. The entire digestion involved IgY aggregation, degradation, re-aggregation, and gradual decomposition into small pieces (by dynamic light scattering). These results indicated that IgY was impressionable, unstable and changeful in gastrointestinal environment, which might impair the bioactive function of IgY. Over 6 peptides (such as RGFK, TVPSGASTK, VPAATASPR) and 21 amino acids were detected, including 6 essential amino acids (methionine, isoleucine, leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and lysine), suggesting that IgY could be involved in human health regulation as active peptides or as rich sources of amino acids in addition to its own bioactive functions. The digestion kinetic curve confirmed that IgY did not reach its maximum digestion at the end of simulation of intestinal phase, implying the incomplete utilization of IgY. This study provides valuable details of oral IgY for development as active ingredients of a functional food, contributing to boosting the egg industry and improving human health.",
