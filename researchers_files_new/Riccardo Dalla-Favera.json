        "Abstract": "Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) includes the Activated B-cell-like (ABC) and Germinal Center B-cell-like (GCB) subtypes, which differ in cell-of-origin, genetics and clinical response. By screening the subtype-specific activity of 211 drugs approved or in active clinical development for other diseases, we identified inhibitors of nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPTi) as active in a subset of GCB-DLBCLs in vitro and in vivo. We validated three chemically distinct NAMPTi for their on-target activity based on biochemical and genetic rescue approaches, and found the ratio between NAMPT:PARP1 RNA levels was predictive of NAMPTi sensitivity across DLBCL subtypes. Notably, the NAMPT:PARP1 transcript ratio predicts higher anti-tumor activity in BCL2-translocated GCB-DLBCL. Accordingly, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of BCL2 was potently synergistic with NAMPT blockade. These data support the inhibition of NAMPT as a therapeutically relevant strategy for BCL2-translocated DLBCLs.",

These analyses also had an impact on our understanding of the initiation, as well as of the evolution of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including resistance to chemotherapy and sensitivity and resistance to novel targeted therapies. This chapter will review the current state of the art in this field, with emphasis on the genetic heterogeneity of the disease and the biological pathways that are altered by the genetic lesions.",

        "Abstract": "To repurpose compounds for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we screened a library of drugs and other targeted compounds approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on 9 cell lines and validated the results on a panel of 32 genetically characterized DLBCL cell lines. Dasatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, was effective against 50% of DLBCL cell lines, as well as against in vivo xenografts. Dasatinib was more broadly active than the Bruton kinase inhibitor ibrutinib and overcame ibrutinib resistance. Tumors exhibiting dasatinib resistance were commonly characterized by activation of the PI3K pathway and loss of PTEN expression as a specific biomarker. PI3K suppression by mTORC2 inhibition synergized with dasatinib and abolished resistance in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a proof of concept for the repurposing approach in DLBCL, and point to dasatinib as an attractive strategy for further clinical development in lymphomas.",

        "Abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most frequent subtype of lymphoid malignancy, remains a significant clinical challenge, as ∼30% of patients are not cured. Over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, spurred by the implementation of powerful genomic technologies that enabled the definition of its genetic and epigenetic landscape. These studies have uncovered a multitude of genomic alterations that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the tumor clone by disrupting biological functions known to be critical for the normal biology of its cells of origin, germinal center B cells. The identified alterations involve epigenetic remodeling, block of differentiation, escape from immune surveillance, and the constitutive activation of several signal transduction pathways. This wealth of new information offers unique opportunities for the development of improved diagnostic and prognostic tools that could help guide the clinical management of DLBCL patients. Furthermore, a number of the mutated genes identified are potentially actionable targets that are currently being explored for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge of the most common genetic alterations associated with DLBCL in relation to their functional impact on the malignant transformation process, and discusses their clinical implications for mechanism-based therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required for the germinal center (GC) reaction and is implicated in lymphomagenesis. BCL6 protein stability is regulated by F-box protein 11 (FBXO11)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, which is impaired in ∼6% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas that carry inactivating genetic alterations targeting the FBXO11 gene. In order to investigate the role of FBXO11 in vivo, we analyzed GC-specific FBXO11 knockout mice. FBXO11 reduction or loss led to an increased number of GC B cells, to an altered ratio of GC dark zone to light zone cells, and to higher levels of BCL6 protein in GC B cells. B-cell receptor-mediated degradation of BCL6 was reduced in the absence of FBXO11, suggesting that FBXO11 contributes to the physiologic downregulation of BCL6 at the end of the GC reaction. Finally, FBXO11 inactivation was associated with the development of lymphoproliferative disorders in mice.",

        "Abstract": "The pathways regulating formation of the germinal center (GC) dark zone (DZ) and light zone (LZ) are unknown. In this study we show that FOXO1 transcription factor expression was restricted to the GC DZ and was required for DZ formation, since its absence in mice led to the loss of DZ gene programs and the formation of LZ-only GCs. FOXO1-negative GC B cells displayed normal somatic hypermutation but defective affinity maturation and class switch recombination. The function of FOXO1 in sustaining the DZ program involved the trans-activation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and cooperation with the BCL6 transcription factor in the trans-repression of genes involved in immune activation, DNA repair, and plasma cell differentiation. These results also have implications for the role of FOXO1 in lymphomagenesis because they suggest that constitutive FOXO1 activity might be required for the oncogenic activity of deregulated BCL6 expression.",

Over the past decade, the rapid expansion of sequencing technologies allowing the genome-wide assessment of genomic and transcriptional changes has revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of DLBCL by providing a comprehensive and unbiased view of the genes/pathways that are disrupted by genetic alterations in this disease, and may contribute to tumor initiation and expansion. These studies uncovered the existence of several previously unappreciated alterations in key cellular pathways that may also influence treatment outcome. Indeed, a number of newly identified genetic lesions are currently being explored as markers for improved diagnosis and risk stratification, or are entering clinical trials as promising therapeutic targets. This review focuses on recent advances in the genomic characterization of DLBCL and discusses how information gained from these efforts has provided new insights into its biology, uncovering potential targets of prognostic and therapeutic relevance.",

        "Abstract": "Germinal centres (GCs) are involved in the selection of B cells secreting high-affinity antibodies and are also the origin of most human B cell lymphomas. Recent progress has been made in identifying the functionally relevant stages of the GC and the complex trafficking mechanisms of B cells within the GC. These studies have identified transcription factors and signalling pathways that regulate distinct phases of GC development. Notably, these factors and pathways are hijacked during tumorigenesis, as revealed by analyses of the genetic lesions associated with various types of B cell lymphomas. This Review focuses on recent insights into the mechanisms that regulate GC development and that are relevant for human B cell lymphomagenesis.",

The pathogenesis of this process remains largely unknown. Using whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis, we show here that the dominant clone of FL and transformed FL (tFL) arise by divergent evolution from a common mutated precursor through the acquisition of distinct genetic events. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers and antiapoptotic genes are introduced early in the common precursor, whereas tFL is specifically associated with alterations deregulating cell-cycle progression and DNA damage responses (CDKN2A/B, MYC, and TP53) as well as aberrant somatic hypermutation. The genomic profile of tFL shares similarities with that of germinal center B cell-type de novo DLBCL but also displays unique combinations of altered genes with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

        "Abstract": "Richter syndrome (RS) derives from the rare transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly of the diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) type. The molecular pathogenesis of RS is only partially understood. By combining whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis of 9 CLL-RS pairs and of an extended panel of 43 RS cases, we show that this aggressive disease typically arises from the predominant CLL clone by acquiring an average of ∼20 genetic lesions/case. RS lesions are heterogeneous in terms of load and spectrum among patients, and include those involved in CLL progression and chemorefractoriness (TP53 disruption and NOTCH1 activation) as well as some not previously implicated in CLL or RS pathogenesis. In particular, disruption of the CDKN2A/B cell cycle regulator is associated with ∼30% of RS cases. Finally, we report that the genomic landscape of RS is significantly different from that of de novo DLBCL, suggesting that they represent distinct disease entities. These results provide insights into RS pathogenesis, and identify dysregulated pathways of potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.",

        "Abstract": "In the last decade, advances in sequencing technology and a renewed focus on the regulatory potential of RNA molecules have combined to stimulate an enormous expansion in the catalog of known eukaryotic RNAs. Beyond the sheer numerical diversity of RNA species, recent studies have begun to uncover hints of even greater functional complexity. An increasing number of RNA molecules, including those from classic, well-studied classes, have been found to act in previously unanticipated regulatory roles, or as substrate for the biogenesis of functionally distinct RNA molecules, or both. Thus, these molecules can fulfill multiple, parallel functions, compounding the already rich landscape of RNA biology, and potentially connecting disparate biological regulatory networks in unexpected ways. In this article, we review recently discovered instances of RNA multifunctionality, with a particular focus on regulatory small RNAs.",

        "Abstract": "MEF2B encodes a transcriptional activator and is mutated in ∼11% of diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and ∼12% of follicular lymphomas (FLs). Here we found that MEF2B directly activated the transcription of the proto-oncogene BCL6 in normal germinal-center (GC) B cells and was required for DLBCL proliferation. Mutation of MEF2B resulted in enhanced transcriptional activity of MEF2B either through disruption of its interaction with the corepressor CABIN1 or by rendering it insensitive to inhibitory signaling events mediated by phosphorylation and sumoylation. Consequently, the transcriptional activity of Bcl-6 was deregulated in DLBCLs with MEF2B mutations. Thus, somatic mutations of MEF2B may contribute to lymphomagenesis by deregulating BCL6 expression, and MEF2B may represent an alternative target for blocking Bcl-6 activity in DLBCLs.",

The emerging spectrum of alterations in tumors is complex and the identification of relevant genes and pathways remains a challenge. Furthermore, key cancer genes are usually found amplified or deleted in chromosomal regions containing many other genes. Point mutations, on the other hand, provide exquisite information about amino acid changes that could be implicated in the oncogenic process. Current large-scale genomic projects provide high throughput genomic data in a large number of well-characterized tumor samples.",

        "Abstract": "Sequencing studies from several model systems have suggested that diverse and abundant small RNAs may be derived from tRNA, but the function of these molecules remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that one such tRNA-derived fragment, cloned from human mature B cells and designated CU1276, in fact possesses the functional characteristics of a microRNA, including a DICER1-dependent biogenesis, physical association with Argonaute proteins, and the ability to repress mRNA transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. Expression of CU1276 is abundant in normal germinal center B cells but absent in germinal center-derived lymphomas, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Furthermore, CU1276 represses endogenous RPA1, an essential gene involved in many aspects of DNA dynamics, and consequently, expression of this tRNA-derived microRNA in a lymphoma cell line suppresses proliferation and modulates the molecular response to DNA damage. These results establish that functionally active microRNAs can be derived from tRNA, thus defining a class of genetic entities with potentially important biological roles.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required for germinal center (GC) formation and whose de-regulation is involved in lymphomagenesis. Although substantial evidence indicates that BCL6 exerts its function by repressing the transcription of hundreds of protein-coding genes, its potential role in regulating gene expression via microRNAs (miRNAs) is not known. We have identified a core of 15 miRNAs that show binding of BCL6 in their genomic loci and are down-regulated in GC B cells. Among BCL6 validated targets, miR-155 and miR-361 directly modulate AID expression, indicating that via repression of these miRNAs, BCL6 up-regulates AID. Similarly, the expression of additional genes relevant for the GC phenotype, including SPI1, IRF8, and MYB, appears to be sustained via BCL6-mediated repression of miR-155. These findings identify a novel mechanism by which BCL6, in addition to repressing protein coding genes, promotes the expression of important GC functions by repressing specific miRNAs.",

Here, we highlight important genetic alterations that contribute to tumorigenesis, clinical progression, and chemorefractoriness of CLL. All CLLs share a common gene expression profile that suggests derivation from antigen-experienced B cells, a model supported by frequent B cell receptor repertoire skewing and stereotypy. Many CLL patients carry mutated immuno-globulin heavy-chain variable genes, while approximately 35% harbor unmutated IgV genes, which are associated with an inferior outcome. Deletion of chromosome 13q14, which is the most common genetic mutation at diagnosis, is considered an initiating lesion that frequently results in disruption of the tumor suppressor locus DLEU2/MIR15A/MIR16A. Next-generation sequencing has revealed additional recurrent genetic lesions that are implicated in CLL pathogenesis. These advancements in the molecular genetics of CLL have important implications for stratifying treatment based on molecular prognosticators and for targeted therapy.",

        "Abstract": "After antigenic challenge, B cells enter the dark zone (DZ) of germinal centers (GCs) to proliferate and hypermutate their immunoglobulin genes. Mutants with greater affinity for the antigen are positively selected in the light zone (LZ) to either differentiate into plasma and memory cells or reenter the DZ. The molecular circuits that govern positive selection in the GC are not known. We show here that the GC reaction required biphasic regulation of expression of the cell-cycle regulator c-Myc that involved its transient induction during early GC commitment, its repression by Bcl-6 in DZ B cells and its reinduction in B cells selected for reentry into the DZ. Inhibition of c-Myc in vivo led to GC collapse, which indicated an essential role for c-Myc in GCs. Our results have implications for the mechanism of GC selection and the role of c-Myc in lymphomagenesis.",

        "Abstract": "BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor required in mature B cells during the germinal center (GC) reaction. Multiple mechanisms act coordinately to timely modulate BCL6 expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. BCL6 prevents premature activation and differentiation of GC B cells and provides an environment tolerant of the DNA breaks associated with immunoglobulin gene remodeling mechanisms involved in the production of high-affinity antibodies of different isotypes. The critical functions exerted by BCL6 during normal B-cell development can be hijacked by the malignant transformation process. Indeed, BCL6 is targeted by genetic aberrations and acts as an oncogene in GC-derived lymphomas. The aberrations affecting BCL6 interfere with the multiple levels of regulation that grant a fine tuning of BCL6 expression and activity in physiologic conditions. This review summarizes the current knowledge on BCL6 function and its role in lymphomagenesis.",

High-throughput sequencing (HTS), expression profiles, proteomics, and electronic health records (EHR) are some examples of such technologies. Extracting meaningful information from those technologies requires careful analysis of the large volumes of data they produce. In this note, we present a set of fractal-like distributions that commonly appear in the analysis of such data. The first set of examples are drawn from a HTS experiment. Here, the distributions appear as part of the evaluation of the error rate of the sequencing and the identification of tumorogenic genomic alterations. The other examples are obtained from risk factor evaluation and analysis of relative disease prevalence and co-mordbidity as these appear in EHR. The distributions are also relevant to identification of subclonal populations in tumors and the study of quasi-species and intrahost diversity of viral populations.",

        "Abstract": "We report that diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) commonly fails to express cell-surface molecules necessary for the recognition of tumor cells by immune-effector cells. In 29% of cases, mutations and deletions inactivate the β2-Microglobulin gene, thus preventing the cell-surface expression of the HLA class-I (HLA-I) complex that is necessary for recognition by CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells. In 21% of cases, analogous lesions involve the CD58 gene, which encodes a molecule involved in T and natural killer cell-mediated responses. In addition to gene inactivation, alternative mechanisms lead to aberrant expression of HLA-I and CD58 in >60% of DLBCL. These two events are significantly associated in this disease, suggesting that they are coselected during lymphomagenesis for their combined role in escape from immune-surveillance.",

Although a number of structural alterations have been associated with the pathogenesis of this malignancy, the full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the DLBCL genome, and therefore the identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, remains unknown. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show that the DLBCL coding genome contains, on average, more than 30 clonally represented gene alterations per case. This analysis also revealed mutations in genes not previously implicated in DLBCL pathogenesis, including those regulating chromatin methylation (MLL2; 24% of samples) and immune recognition by T cells. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the DLBCL coding genome and identify novel dysregulated pathways underlying its pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma comprises biologically and clinically distinct diseases the pathogenesis of which is associated with genetic lesions affecting oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes. We report here that the two most common types--follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma--harbour frequent structural alterations inactivating CREBBP and, more rarely, EP300, two highly related histone and non-histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as transcriptional co-activators in multiple signalling pathways. Overall, about 39% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41% of follicular lymphoma cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions usually affect one allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 oncoprotein and activation of the p53 tumour suppressor. These results identify CREBBP/EP300 mutations as a major pathogenetic mechanism shared by common forms of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with direct implications for the use of drugs targeting acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "We utilized gene expression profiling of a comprehensive panel of purified developmentally defined normal murine B cells to identify unique transcriptional signatures for each subset. To elucidate transcription factor activities that function in a stage-specific fashion, we used gene sets that share transcription factor targets and found that germinal center B cells had a robust enrichment of up-regulated and down-regulated signatures compared with the other B-cell subsets. Notably, we found Yy1 and its targets to be central regulators of the germinal center B (GCB)-specific transcriptional program with binding of Yy1 to select signature genes in GCB cells, and translation of the Yy1 signatures to human GCB cells. We then tested whether our newly generated, stage-specific transcriptional signatures could be used to link murine lymphoma models to stages of normal B-cell development. Although each of the molecularly defined murine lymphoma models conserved certain stage-specific features of normal B-cell development, there was a significant alteration of the normal differentiation signature following malignant transformation. These findings offer important tools and insights for elucidating differences between normal and malignant B cells.",

These phenotypic subtypes segregate with largely unique genetic lesions, suggesting the involvement of different pathogenetic mechanisms. In this report we show that the BLIMP1/PRDM1 gene is inactivated by multiple mechanisms, including homozygous deletions, truncating or missense mutations, and transcriptional repression by constitutively active BCL6, in ∼53% of ABC-DLBCL. In vivo, conditional deletion of Blimp1 in mouse B cells promotes the development of lymphoproliferative disorders recapitulating critical features of the human ABC-DLBCL. These results demonstrate that BLIMP1 is a bona fide tumor-suppressor gene whose loss contributes to lymphomagenesis by blocking plasma cell differentiation.",

        "Title": "New insights into the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable disease of the elderly, stands out as unique among the malignancies derived from mature B lymphocytes. The histology, immunophenotype, immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) gene somatic hypermutation status, and the pattern of genetic alterations of the tumor cells are markedly distinct from that of any other B-cell tumor. Most notably, CLL cases can have somatically mutated as well as unmutated IgV genes which largely correlate with a favorable and unfavorable clinical prognosis, respectively. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that 6% of the normal elderly population develops a monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) that appears as the precursor to CLL in 1-2% of cases. Over the last decade, global gene expression profile analysis was instrumental in defining CLL as a malignancy originating from the oncogenic transformation of a common cellular precursor that resembles an antigen-experienced B cell. These findings were complemented by the realization that all CLL, independent of their IgV gene somatic mutation status, express B-cell receptors (BCRs) that show evidence of antigen-experience. Indeed, the BCRs of CLL cases among different individuals can be similar to the extent that one was able to define subsets of stereotyped receptors based on the homology in the antigen-binding regions. Together, these observations strongly support the notion that antigen plays a critical role in CLL pathogenesis. This role is complemented by genetic alterations that, analogous to most cancer types, represent the initiating pathogenetic event. In fact, CLL cases display recurrent genetic aberrations including trisomy 12 and monoallelic or biallelic deletion/inactivation of chromosomal regions 17p, 11q and 13q14. However, virtually all CLL cases lack balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocations, the genetic hallmark of germinal center (GC)-derived lymphomas. The most frequent genetic aberration in CLL, deletion of chromosomal region 13q14, was recently shown to have a specific role in CLL pathogenesis. This region encodes a tumor suppressor locus comprising a microRNA cluster embedded in a long sterile RNA gene, whose deletion in the mouse leads to lymphoproliferative syndromes recapitulating the human CLL-associated spectrum, including MBL, CLL and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). This review will focus on the cellular origin of CLL, its relationship to the mechanisms of generating CLL-associated genetic lesions and on the role of the 13q14 deletion in CLL pathogenesis as emerging from the analysis of a newly generated mouse model.",

        "Abstract": "BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor which has emerged as a critical regulator of germinal centers (GC), the sites where B cells are selected based on the production of antibodies with high affinity for the antigen. BCL6 is also a frequently activated oncogene in the pathogenesis of human B cell lymphomas, most of which derive from the GC B cells. A thorough understanding of the biological role of BCL6 in normal B cell development and lymphomagenesis depends upon the identification of the full set of genes that are targets of its transcriptional regulatory function. Recently, the identification of BCL6 targets has been implemented with the use of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression profiling approaches. A large set of promoters have been shown to be physically bound by BCL6, but only a fraction of them appears to be subjected to transcriptional repression in GC B cells. This set of BCL6 targets points to a number of cellular functions which are likely to be directly controlled by BCL6 during GC development, including activation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell cycle arrest, cytokine-, toll-like receptor-, TGFbeta-, WNT-signaling, and differentiation. Overall, BCL6 is revealing its dual role of \"safe-keeper\" in preventing centroblasts from responding to signals leading to a premature exit from the GC and of contributor to lymphomagenesis by allowing the instauration of conditions favorable to malignant transformation.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy of B cells of unknown etiology. Deletions of the chromosomal region 13q14 are commonly associated with CLL, with monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL), which occasionally precedes CLL, and with aggressive lymphoma, suggesting that this region contains a tumor-suppressor gene. Here, we demonstrate that deletion in mice of the 13q14-minimal deleted region (MDR), which encodes the DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1 cluster, causes development of indolent B cell-autonomous, clonal lymphoproliferative disorders, recapitulating the spectrum of CLL-associated phenotypes observed in humans. miR-15a/16-1-deletion accelerates the proliferation of both human and mouse B cells by modulating the expression of genes controlling cell-cycle progression.

        "Abstract": "BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor required for mature B-cell germinal center (GC) formation and implicated in lymphomagenesis. BCL6's physiologic function is only partially known because the complete set of its targets in GC B cells has not been identified. To address this issue, we used an integrated biochemical-computational-functional approach to identify BCL6 direct targets in normal GC B cells. This approach includes (1) identification of BCL6-bound promoters by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, (2) inference of transcriptional relationships by the use of a regulatory network reverse engineering approach (ARACNe), and (3) validation of physiologic relevance of the candidate targets down-regulated in GC B cells. Our approach demonstrated that a large set of promoters (> 4000) is physically bound by BCL6 but that only a fraction of them is repressed in GC B cells. This set of 1207 targets identifies several cellular functions directly controlled by BCL6 during GC development, including activation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell cycle arrest, cytokine signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, and differentiation. These results define a broad role of BCL6 in preventing centroblasts from responding to signals leading to exit from the GC before they complete the phase of proliferative expansion and of antibody affinity maturation.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required for germinal center (GC) formation and whose deregulation by genomic lesions is implicated in the pathogenesis of GC-derived diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and, less frequently, follicular lymphoma (FL). The biological function of BCL6 is only partially understood because no more than a few genes have been functionally characterized as direct targets of BCL6 transrepression activity. Here we report that the anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene BCL2 is a direct target of BCL6 in GC B cells. BCL6 binds to the BCL2 promoter region by interacting with the transcriptional activator Miz1 and suppresses Miz1-induced activation of BCL2 expression. BCL6-mediated suppression of BCL2 is lost in FL and DLBCL, where the 2 proteins are pathologically coexpressed, because of BCL2 chromosomal translocations and other mechanisms, including Miz1 deregulation and somatic mutations in the BCL2 promoter region. These results identify an important function for BCL6 in facilitating apoptosis of GC B cells via suppression of BCL2, and suggest that blocking this pathway is critical for lymphomagenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The full set of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the human genome is not known. Because presently known miRNAs have been identified by virtue of their abundant expression in a few cell types, many tissue-specific miRNAs remain unrevealed. To understand the role of miRNAs in B cell function and lymphomagenesis, we generated short-RNA libraries from normal human B cells at different stages of development (naive, germinal center, memory) and from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line. A combination of cloning and computational analysis identified 178 miRNAs (miRNome) expressed in normal and/or transformed B cell libraries. Most notably, the B cell miRNome included 75 miRNAs which to our knowledge have not been previously reported and of which 66 have been validated by RNA blot and/or RT-PCR analyses. Numerous miRNAs were expressed in a stage- or transformation-specific fashion in B cells, suggesting specific functional or pathologic roles. These results provide a resource for studying the role of miRNAs in B cell development, immune function, and lymphomagenesis.",

        "Title": "AID is required for germinal center-derived lymphomagenesis.",
        "Abstract": "Most human B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHLs) derive from germinal centers (GCs), the structure in which B cells undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) before being selected for high-affinity antibody production. The pathogenesis of B-NHL is associated with distinct genetic lesions, including chromosomal translocations and aberrant SHM, which arise from mistakes occurring during CSR and SHM. A direct link between these DNA remodeling events and GC lymphoma development, however, has not been demonstrated. Here we have crossed three mouse models of B cell lymphoma driven by oncogenes (Myc, Bcl6 and Myc/Bcl6; refs. 5,6) with mice lacking activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme required for both CSR and SHM. We show that AID deficiency prevents Bcl6-dependent, GC-derived B-NHL, but has no impact on Myc-driven, pre-GC lymphomas. Accordingly, abrogation of AID is associated with the disappearance of CSR- and SHM-mediated structural alterations. These results show that AID is required for GC-derived lymphomagenesis, supporting the notion that errors in AID-mediated antigen-receptor gene modification processes are principal contributors to the pathogenesis of human B-NHL.",

        "Abstract": "Antigen-specific B cells are selected in germinal centers, the structure in which these cells proliferate while accomplishing genome-remodeling processes such as class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. These events are associated with considerable genotoxic stress, which cells tolerate through suppression of DNA-damage responses by Bcl-6, a transcription factor required for the formation of germinal centers. Here we show that the expression of Bcl-6 is regulated by DNA damage through a signaling pathway that promotes Bcl-6 degradation. After DNA damage accumulated, the kinase ATM promoted Bcl-6 phosphorylation, leading to its interaction with the isomerase Pin1 and its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Because Bcl-6 is required for the maintenance of germinal centers, our findings suggest that the extent of genotoxic stress controls the fate of germinal center B cells by means of Bcl-6.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor necessary for the development of germinal centers (GCs) and directly implicated in lymphomagenesis. Post-GC development of B cells requires BCL6 downregulation, while its constitutive expression caused by chromosomal translocations leads to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Herein we identify a signaling pathway that downregulates BCL6 expression in normal GC B cells and is blocked in a subset of DLBCL due to alterations in the BCL6 gene. Activation of the CD40 receptor leads to NF-kappaB-mediated induction of the IRF4 transcription factor, which, in turn, represses BCL6 expression by binding to its promoter region. A subset of DLBCL displays chromosomal translocations or mutations that disrupt the IRF4-responsive region in the BCL6 promoter and block its downregulation by CD40 signaling.",

However, the biological functions required by c-Myc to induce oncogenesis remain elusive. Here we show that c-Myc has a direct role in the control of DNA replication. c-Myc interacts with the pre-replicative complex and localizes to early sites of DNA synthesis. Depletion of c-Myc from mammalian (human and mouse) cells as well as from Xenopus cell-free extracts, which are devoid of RNA transcription, demonstrates a non-transcriptional role for c-Myc in the initiation of DNA replication. Overexpression of c-Myc causes increased replication origin activity with subsequent DNA damage and checkpoint activation. These findings identify a critical function of c-Myc in DNA replication and suggest a novel mechanism for its normal and oncogenic functions.",

Here we report that the transcription factor IRF4 is required for the generation of plasma cells. Transgenic mice with conditional deletion of Irf4 in germinal center B cells lacked post-germinal center plasma cells and were unable to differentiate memory B cells into plasma cells. Plasma cell differentiation required IRF4 as well as the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1, which both acted 'upstream' of the transcription factor XBP-1. In addition, IRF4-deficient B cells had impaired expression of activation-induced deaminase and lacked class-switch recombination, suggesting an independent function for IRF4 in this process. These results identify IRF4 as a crucial transcriptional 'switch' in the generation of functionally competent plasma cells.",

        "Title": "Inactivation of the PRDM1/BLIMP1 gene in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.",
        "Abstract": "PR domain containing 1 with zinc finger domain (PRDM1)/B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1) is a transcriptional repressor expressed in a subset of germinal center (GC) B cells and in all plasma cells, and required for terminal B cell differentiation. The BLIMP1 locus lies on chromosome 6q21-q22.1, a region frequently deleted in B cell lymphomas, suggesting that it may harbor a tumor suppressor gene. We report here that the BLIMP1 gene is inactivated by structural alterations in 24% (8 out of 34) activated B cell-like diffuse large cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL), but not in GC B cell-like (n = 0/37) or unclassified (n = 0/21) DLBCL. BLIMP1 alterations included gene truncations, nonsense mutations, frameshift deletions, and splice site mutations that generate aberrant transcripts encoding truncated BLIMP1 proteins. In all cases studied, both BLIMP1 alleles were inactivated by deletions or mutations. Furthermore, most non-GC type DLBCL cases (n = 20/26, 77%) lack BLIMP1 protein expression, despite the presence of BLIMP1 mRNA. These results indicate that a sizable fraction of ABC-DLBCL carry an inactive BLIMP1 gene, and suggest that the same gene is inactivated by epigenetic mechanisms in an additional large number of cases. These findings point to a role for BLIMP1 as a tumor suppressor gene, whose inactivation may contribute to lymphomagenesis by blocking post-GC differentiation of B cells toward plasma cells.",

        "Abstract": "During humoral immune responses, two distinct genetic modification events diversify the Ig genes in germinal center (GC) B cells: somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (CSR). Both processes require the activity of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme expressed specifically in GC B cells. However, the mechanisms that regulate AID activity are largely unknown. Here we report that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates AID and regulates its activity in GC B cells. AID physically interacts with the PKA holoenzyme in the cytoplasm and is phosphorylated by the PKA catalytic subunit at specific residues. AID phosphorylation is required for CSR, because substitution of the two phosphorylation targets impairs its ability to rescue CSR in AID-deficient B cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKA prevents isotype class switching in a murine B-cell lymphoma cell line; conversely, B cells from mice where PKA activity is made constitutive by conditional deletion of the PKA regulatory subunit gene display enhanced CSR. These findings implicate PKA in the regulation of AID function and suggest that the control of T cell-dependent immune responses may be modulated, via AID, by signals that activate PKA.",

BCL6 functions by directly binding to specific DNA sequences and suppressing the transcription of target genes. Here we report an alternative mechanism by which BCL6 controls the transcription of genes lacking a BCL6 binding site and show that this mechanism was required for the prevention of tumor suppressor p53-independent cell cycle arrest in germinal center B cells. BCL6 interacted with the transcriptional activator Miz-1 and, via Miz-1, bound to the promoter and suppressed transcription of the cell cycle arrest gene CDKN1A. Through this mechanism, BCL6 may facilitate the proliferative expansion of germinal centers during the normal immune response and, when deregulated, the pathological expansion of B cell lymphomas.",

        "Abstract": "The human proto-oncogene BCL6 encodes a BTB/POZ-zinc-finger transcriptional repressor that is necessary for germinal-centre formation and is implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma. The precise function of BCL6 in germinal-centre development and lymphomagenesis is unclear because very few direct BCL6 target genes have been identified. Here we report that BCL6 suppresses the expression of the p53 (also known as tp53) tumour suppressor gene and modulates DNA damage-induced apoptotic responses in germinal-centre B cells. BCL6 represses p53 transcription by binding two specific DNA sites within the p53 promoter region and, accordingly, p53 expression is absent in germinal-centre B cells where BCL6 is highly expressed. Suppression of BCL6 expression via specific short interfering RNA leads to increased levels of p53 messenger RNA and protein both under basal conditions and in response to DNA damage. Most notably, constitutive expression of BCL6 protects B cell lines from apoptosis induced by DNA damage. These results suggest that an important function of BCL6 is to allow germinal-centre B cells to tolerate the physiological DNA breaks required for immunoglobulin class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation without inducing a p53-dependent apoptotic response. These findings also imply that deregulated BCL6 expression contributes to lymphomagenesis in part by functional inactivation of p53.",

        "Abstract": "Substantial evidence indicates that signaling through the CD40 receptor (CD40) is required for germinal center (GC) and memory B-cell formation. However, it is not fully understood at which stages of B-cell development the CD40 pathway is activated in vivo. To address this question, we induced CD40 signaling in human transformed GC B cells in vitro and identified a CD40 gene expression signature by DNA microarray analysis. This signature was then investigated in the gene expression profiles of normal B cells and found in pre- and post-GC B cells (naive and memory) but, surprisingly, not in GC B cells. This finding was validated in lymphoid tissues by showing that the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factors, which translocate to the nucleus upon CD40 stimulation, are retained in the cytoplasm in most GC B cells, indicating the absence of CD40 signaling. Nevertheless, a subset of centrocytes and B cells in the subepithelium showed nuclear staining of multiple NF-kappaB subunits, suggesting that a fraction of naive and memory B cells may be subject to CD40 signaling or to other signals that activate NF-kappaB. Together, these results show that GC expansion occurs in the absence of CD40 signaling, which may act only in the initial and final stages of the GC reaction.",

        "Title": "Expression of the AID protein in normal and neoplastic B cells.",
        "Abstract": "Somatic hypermutation (SHM) targets primarily the immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes in germinal center (GC) B cells, thereby allowing antibody affinity maturation. A malfunction of SHM, termed aberrant somatic hypermutation (ASHM), was found in about 50% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), leading to mutations in the 5' sequences of multiple genes, including oncogenes. Although the SHM mechanism is largely unknown, it was shown to require the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene. AID mRNA is expressed in GC B cells and GC-derived lymphomas, but the pattern of expression of the AID protein is not known. Using 2 specific antibodies, here we show that the AID protein can be detected in GC centroblasts and their transformed counterpart (Burkitt lymphoma) but not in pre-GC B cells and post-GC neoplasms, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. DLBCLs displayed variable levels of AID expression, which did not correlate with IgV ongoing hypermutation, ASHM, or disease subtype. Finally, both in normal and malignant B cells the AID protein appeared predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the AID protein is specifically expressed in normal and transformed GC B cells; nonetheless, its predominantly cytoplasmic localization suggests that additional mechanisms may regulate its function and may be altered during lymphomagenesis.",

        "Title": "Molecular pathogenesis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: the role of Bcl-6.",
        "Abstract": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) form a heterogeneous group of diseases, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) comprising the largest subgroup. The commonest chromosomal translocations found in DLBCL are those affecting band 3q27. In 35% of DLBCL cases, as well as in a small fraction of follicular lymphomas, the normal transcriptional regulation of Bcl-6 is disrupted by these chromosomal translocations. In addition, about three-quarters of cases of DLBCL display multiple somatic mutations in the 5' non-coding region of Bcl-6, which occur independently of chromosomal translocations and appear to be due to the IgV-associated somatic hypermutation process. Bcl-6 is a 95-kD nuclear phosphoprotein belonging to the BTB/POZ (bric-a-brac, tramtrack, broad complex/Pox virus zinc finger) zinc finger family of transcription factors. It has been suggested that Bcl-6 is important in the repression of genes involved in the control of lymphocyte activation, differentiation, and apoptosis within the germinal center, and that its down-regulation is necessary for normal B-cells to exit the germinal center. Bcl-6 remains constitutively expressed in a substantial proportion of B-cell lymphomas. Recently, acetylation has been identified as a mode for down-regulating Bcl-6 activity by inhibition of the ability of Bcl-6 to recruit complexes containing histone deacetylases (HDAC). The pharmacologic inhibition of two recently identified deacetylation pathways, HDAC- and silent information regulator (SIR)-2-dependent deacetylation, results in the accumulation of inactive acetylated Bcl-6 and thus in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma cells. These results reveal a new method of regulating Bcl-6, with the potential for therapeutic exploitation. These studies also indicate a novel mechanism by which acetylation promotes transcription, not only by modifying histones and activating transcriptional activators, but also by inhibiting transcriptional repressors.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor required for the development of germinal centers (GCs) and implicated in the pathogenesis of GC-derived B cell lymphoma. Understanding the precise role of BCL6 in normal GC formation and in lymphomagenesis depends on the identification of genes that are direct targets of its transcriptional repression. Here we report that BCL6 directly controls the expression of B7-1/CD80, a costimulatory receptor involved in B-T cell interactions critical for the development of T cell-mediated antibody responses. Upon CD40 signaling, transcription of the CD80 gene is induced by the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcription factor. Our results show that BCL6 prevents CD40-induced expression of CD80 by binding its promoter region in vivo and suppressing its transcriptional activation by NF-kappaB. Consistent with a physiologic role for BCL6 in suppressing CD80, the expression of these two genes is mutually exclusive in B cells, and BCL6-defective mice show increased expression of CD80 in B cells. The results suggest that BCL6 may directly control the ability of B cell to interact with T cells during normal GC development. In addition, these findings imply that T-B cell interactions may be disrupted in B cell lymphoma expressing deregulated BCL6 genes.",

        "Abstract": "The germinal center (GC) reaction in T cell dependent antibody responses is crucial for the generation of B cell memory and plays a critical role in B cell lymphomagenesis. To gain insight into the physiology of this reaction, we identified the transcriptional changes that occur in B cells during the GC-transit (naïve B cells --> CD77(+) centroblasts (CBs) --> CD77(-) centrocytes (CCs) --> memory B cells) by DNA microarray experiments and the subsequent data analysis employing unsupervised and supervised hierarchical clustering. The naïve B cell is characterized by a nonproliferative, anti-apoptotic phenotype and the expression of various chemokine and cytokine receptors. The transition from naïve B cells to CBs is associated with (1) the up-regulation of genes associated with cellular proliferation, DNA-repair, and chromatin remodeling; (2) the acquisition of a pro-apoptotic phenotype; (3) the down-regulation of cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion receptors expressed in the naïve cells; and (4) the expression of a distinct adhesion repertoire. The CB and the CC revealed surprisingly few gene expression differences, suggesting that the CC is heterogeneous in its cellular composition. The CB/CC to memory B cell transition shows a general reversion to the profile characteristic for the naïve B cells, with the exception of the up-regulation of several surface receptors, including CD27, CD80, and IL-2Rbeta, and the simultaneous expression of both anti- and pro-apoptotic genes. These gene expression profiles of the normal B cell subpopulations are being used to identify the signals occurring during GC development, the cellular derivation of various types of B cell malignancies, and the genes deregulated in GC-derived tumors.",

        "Abstract": "The pathogenesis of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphomas (AIDS-NHLs) is associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate the expression of various oncogenes. Recently, a novel mechanism of genetic lesion, termed aberrant hypermutation, has been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of immunocompetent hosts. In these tumors, the somatic hypermutation (SHM) process that normally targets immunoglobulin V (IgV) genes in B cells appears to misfire and causes mutations in the 5' sequences of multiple proto-oncogenes, including PIM-1, PAX-5, RhoH/TTF, and c-MYC. To investigate whether aberrant hypermutation occurs also in AIDS-NHL, we studied the mutation profile of these 4 genes in various histologic subtypes. Mutations in 1 gene or more were detected in 19 of 39 (48.7%) AIDS-NHL cases (10 of 18 AIDS-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 4 of 11 AIDS-Burkitt lymphoma; 4 of 6 AIDS-primary effusion lymphoma; 1 of 4 AIDS-primary central nervous system lymphoma), with 9 of 39 (23.1%) cases carrying mutations in 2 or more genes. Overall, PIM-1 was mutated in 5 of 39 (12.8%), PAX-5 in 8 of 39 (20.5%), RhoH/TTF in 9 of 39 (23.1%), and c-MYC in 7 of 27 (25.9%) AIDS-NHL cases. Mutations were represented mainly by single base pair substitutions (n = 63) with rare deletions/insertions (n = 5) and displayed features typical of the IgV-associated SHM process. In addition, a number of mutations in PIM-1 and c-MYC were found to affect coding exons, leading to amino acid substitutions with likely functional consequences. Analysis of intraclonal heterogeneity documented that the aberrant hypermutation activity may be ongoing in at least some cases. These data indicate that aberrant hypermutation is associated with various subtypes of AIDS-NHL and may represent a major contributor to their pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The germinal center (GC) reaction is crucial for T cell-dependent immune responses and is targeted by B cell lymphomagenesis. Here we analyzed the transcriptional changes that occur in B cells during GC transit (naive B cells --> centroblasts --> centrocytes --> memory B cells) by gene expression profiling. Naive B cells, characterized by the expression of cell cycle-inhibitory and antiapoptotic genes, become centroblasts by inducing an atypical proliferation program lacking c-Myc expression, switching to a proapoptotic program, and down-regulating cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion receptors. The transition from GC to memory cells is characterized by a return to a phenotype similar to that of naive cells except for an apoptotic program primed for both death and survival and for changes in the expression of cell surface receptors including IL-2 receptor beta. These results provide insights into the dynamics of the GC reaction and represent the basis for the analysis of B cell malignancies.",

        "Abstract": "Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a malignancy of unknown pathogenesis. The malignant Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells derive from germinal center B cells (or rarely, T cells) but have a heterogeneous and largely uncharacterized phenotype. Using microarrays, we compared the gene expression profile of four HL cell lines with profiles of the main B cell subsets and B cell non-HLs to find out whether HRS cells, despite their described heterogeneity, show a distinct gene expression, to study their relationship to other normal and malignant B cells, and to identify genes aberrantly or overexpressed by HRS cells. The HL lines indeed clustered as a distinct entity, irrespective of their B or T cell derivation, and their gene expression was most similar to that of EBV-transformed B cells and cell lines derived from diffuse large cell lymphomas showing features of in vitro-activated B cells. Twenty-seven genes, most of which were previously unknown to be expressed by HRS cells, showed aberrant expression specifically in these cells, e.g., the transcription factors GATA-3, ABF1, EAR3, and Nrf3. For five genes, expression in primary HRS cells was confirmed. The newly identified HL-specific genes may play important roles in the pathogenesis of HL, potentially represent novel diagnostic markers, and can be considered for therapeutic targeting.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor whose expression is deregulated by chromosomal translocations in approximately 40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). The BCL6 regulatory sequences are also targeted by somatic hypermutation in germinal center (GC) B cells and in a fraction of all GC-derived lymphomas. However, the functional consequences of these mutations are unknown. Here we report that a subset of mutations specifically associated with DLBCL causes deregulated BCL6 transcription. These mutations affect 2 adjacent BCL6 binding sites located within the first noncoding exon of the gene, and they prevent BCL6 from binding its own promoter, thereby disrupting its negative autoregulatory circuit. These alterations were found in approximately 16% of DLBCLs devoid of chromosomal translocations involving the BCL6 locus, but they were not found in normal GC B cells. This study establishes a novel mechanism for BCL6 deregulation and reveals a broader involvement of this gene in DLBCL pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The c-MYC proto-oncogene encodes a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation and broadly implicated in tumorigenesis. Understanding the function of c-MYC and its role in cancer depends upon the identification of c-MYC target genes. Here we show that c-MYC induces the activity of Protein Kinase A (PKA), a key effector of cAMP-mediated signal transduction, by inducing the transcription of the gene encoding the PKA catalytic subunit beta (PKA-Cbeta). c-MYC-mediated induction of PKA-Cbeta gene transcription occurs in multiple tissues, is independent of cell proliferation and is mediated by direct binding of c-MYC to the PKA-Cbeta gene promoter sequences. Constitutive expression of PKA-Cbeta in Rat1A cells induces their transformation, and c-MYC-induced transformation can be reverted by pharmacological inhibition of PKA, suggesting that up-regulation of PKA is critical for c-MYC-associated tumorigenesis. These results indicate that, by activating PKA, c-MYC can provide endogenous activation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway independently of extracellular signals.",

        "Title": "Acetylation inactivates the transcriptional repressor BCL6.",
        "Abstract": "The proto-oncogene BCL6 encodes a BTB/POZ-zinc finger transcriptional repressor that is necessary for germinal-center formation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas. Here we show that the co-activator p300 binds and acetylates BCL6 in vivo and inhibits its function. Acetylation disrupts the ability of BCL6 to recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs), thereby hindering its capacity to repress transcription and to induce cell transformation. BCL6 is acetylated under physiologic conditions in normal germinal-center B cells and in germinal center-derived B-cell tumors. Treatment with specific inhibitors shows that levels of acetylation of BCL6 are controlled by both HDAC-dependent and SIR2-dependent pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of these pathways leads to the accumulation of the inactive acetylated BCL6 and to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma cells. These results identify a new mechanism of regulation of the proto-oncogene BCL6 with potential for therapeutic exploitation. Furthermore, these findings provide a new mechanism by which acetylation can promote transcription not only by modifying histones and activating transcriptional activators, but also by inhibiting transcriptional repressors.",

        "Title": "Alternative translocation breakpoint cluster region 5' to BCL-6 in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",
        "Abstract": "Chromosomal translocations involving band 3q27 with various different partner chromosomes represent a recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In a fraction of these translocations, the chromosomal breakpoint is located within the 5' noncoding region of the BCL-6 proto-oncogene where the BCL-6 major breakpoint region (MBR) maps. As a result of the translocation, BCL-6 expression is deregulated by promoter substitution. However, between 30 and 50% of lymphomas with cytogenetically detectable translocations affecting band 3q27 retain a germ-line configuration at the BCL-6 locus. To identify possible additional breakpoint clusters within 3q27, we cloned a t(3;14)(q27;q32) lymphoma without MBR rearrangement and found a novel breakpoint site located between 245 and 285 kb 5' to BCL-6. Breakpoints within this newly described region, which we called the alternative breakpoint region (ABR), were found to be recurrent in lymphomas carrying t(3q27) chromosomal translocations but devoid of BCL-6 MBR rearrangements. Comparative analysis of multiple lymphomas carrying rearrangements within the ABR showed that the breakpoints cluster within a 20-kb distance. Translocations involving the ABR may juxtapose BCL-6 to distantly acting, heterologous transcriptional regulatory elements which cause deregulation of the proto-oncogene. The identification of BCL-6 ABR provides new tools for the diagnosis of lymphomas carrying aberrations at 3q27 and deregulated BCL-6 genes.",

        "Abstract": "The IRTA1 and IRTA2 genes encode immunoglobulinlike cell surface receptors expressed in B cells and involved in chromosome 1q21 translocations in B-cell malignancy. We have now characterized and comparatively analyzed the structure and expression pattern of the entire family of IRTA genes, which includes 5 members contiguously located on chromosome 1q21. The IRTA messenger RNAs are expressed predominantly in the B-cell lineage within discrete B-cell compartments: IRTA1 is specific to the marginal zone, IRTA2 and IRTA3 are found in the germinal center light zone and in intraepithelial and interfollicular regions, and IRTA4 and IRTA5 are expressed predominantly in the mantle zone. All IRTA genes code for transmembrane receptors that are closely related to Fc receptors in their most amino-terminal extracellular domains and that possess cytoplasmic domains containing ITIM (immunotyrosine inhibition motifs)- and, possibly, ITAM (immunotyrosine activation motifs)-like motifs. These structural features suggest that the IRTA receptors may play a role in regulating activation of normal B cells and possibly in the development of neoplasia.",
