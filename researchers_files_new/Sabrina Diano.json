        "Abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that the melanocortin system is not only a central player in energy homeostasis, food intake and glucose level regulation, but also in the modulation of cardiovascular functions, such as blood pressure and heart rate. The melanocortins, and in particular α- and γ-MSH, have been shown to exert their cardiovascular activity both at the central nervous system level and in the periphery (e.g., in the adrenal gland), binding their receptors MC3R and MC4R and influencing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. In addition, some studies have shown that the activation of MC3R and MC4R by their endogenous ligands is able to improve the outcome of cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial and cerebral ischemia. In this brief review, we will discuss the current knowledge of how the melanocortin system influences essential cardiovascular functions, such as blood pressure and heart rate, and its protective role in ischemic events, with a particular focus on the central regulation of such mechanisms.",

        "Title": "Melanocortin Signaling Connecting Systemic Metabolism With Mood Disorders.",
        "Abstract": "Obesity and mood disorders are often overlapping pathologies that are prevalent public health concerns. Many studies have indicated a positive correlation between depression and obesity, although weight loss and decreased appetite are also recognized as features of depression. Accordingly, DSM-5 defines two subtypes of depression associated with changes in feeding: melancholic depression, characterized by anhedonia and associated with decreased feeding and appetite; and atypical depression, characterized by fatigue, sleepiness, hyperphagia, and weight gain. The central nervous system plays a key role in the regulation of feeding and mood, thus suggesting that overlapping neuronal circuits may be involved in their modulation. However, these circuits have yet to be completely characterized. The central melanocortin system, a circuitry characterized by the expression of specific peptides (pro-opiomelanocortins, agouti-related protein, and neuropeptide Y) and their melanocortin receptors, has been shown to be a key player in the regulation of feeding. In addition, the melanocortin system has also been shown to affect anxiety and depressive-like behavior, thus suggesting a possible role of the melanocortin system as a biological substrate linking feeding and depression. However, more studies are needed to fully understand this complex system and its role in regulating metabolic and mood disorders. In this review, we will discuss the current literature on the role of the melanocortin system in human and animal models in feeding and mood regulation, providing evidence of the biological interplay between anxiety, major depressive disorders, appetite, and body weight regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity, have become a major global health threat of the twenty-first century. Maintaining glucose homeostasis is essential for survival in mammals. Complex and highly coordinated interactions between glucose-sensing mechanisms and multiple effector systems are essential for controlling glucose levels in the blood. The central nervous system (CNS) plays a crucial role in regulating glucose homeostasis. Growing evidence indicates that disruption of glucose sensing in selective CNS areas, such as the hypothalamus, is closely interlinked with the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the underlying intracellular mechanisms of glucose sensing in the hypothalamus remain elusive. Here, we review the current literature on hypothalamic glucose-sensing mechanisms and discuss the impact of alterations of these mechanisms on the pathogenesis of diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Microglia play a crucial role in immune responses, including inflammation. Diet-induced obesity (DIO) triggers microglia activation and hypothalamic inflammation as early as 3 days after high-fat diet (HFD) exposure, before changes in body weight occur. The intracellular mechanism(s) responsible for HFD-induced microglia activation is ill defined. Here, we show that in vivo, HFD induced a rapid and transient increase in uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) mRNA expression together with changes in mitochondrial dynamics. Selective microglial deletion of Ucp2 prevented changes in mitochondrial dynamics and function, microglia activation, and hypothalamic inflammation. In association with these, male and female mice were protected from HFD-induced obesity, showing decreased feeding and increased energy expenditure that were associated with changes in the synaptic input organization and activation of the anorexigenic hypothalamic POMC neurons and astrogliosis. Together, our data point to a fuel-availability-driven mitochondrial mechanism as a major player of microglia activation in the central regulation of DIO.",

In the central nervous system, high energy-demanding neurons are critically dependent on mitochondria to fulfill their appropriate functions. The hypothalamus is a key brain area for maintaining glucose and energy homeostasis via the ability of hypothalamic neurons to sense, integrate, and respond to numerous metabolic signals. Mitochondrial function has emerged as an important component in the regulation of hypothalamic neurons controlling glucose and energy homeostasis. Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, emerging evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction in hypothalamic neurons may contribute to the development of various metabolic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this review, we summarize recent studies demonstrating the link between mitochondria and hypothalamic neural control of glucose and energy homeostasis. Finally, this review provides an insight to understand how mitochondria in hypothalamic neurons may contribute to the development of metabolic disorders, such as T2DM and obesity.",

        "Abstract": "The hypothalamus is an evolutionarily conserved brain structure that regulates an organism's basic functions, such as homeostasis and reproduction. Several hypothalamic nuclei and neuronal circuits have been the focus of many studies seeking to understand their role in regulating these basic functions. Within the hypothalamic neuronal populations, the arcuate melanocortin system plays a major role in controlling homeostatic functions. The arcuate pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in particular have been shown to be critical regulators of metabolism and reproduction because of their projections to several brain areas both in and outside of the hypothalamus, such as autonomic regions of the brain stem and spinal cord. Here, we review and discuss the current understanding of POMC neurons from their development and intracellular regulators to their physiological functions and pathological dysregulation.",

How neurons in this brain area adapt to the changing metabolic environment to regulate circulating glucose levels is ill defined. Here, we show that glucose load results in mitochondrial fission and reduced reactive oxygen species in VMH neurons mediated by dynamin-related peptide 1 (DRP1) under the control of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Probed by genetic manipulations and chemical-genetic control of VMH neuronal circuitry, we unmasked that this mitochondrial adaptation determines the size of the pool of glucose-excited neurons in the VMH and that this process regulates systemic glucose homeostasis. Thus, our data unmasked a critical cellular biological process controlled by mitochondrial dynamics in VMH regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Prolyl endopeptidase (PREP) is a serine protease which has been implicated in many biological processes, such as the maturation and degradation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides, learning and memory, cell proliferation and differentiation, and glucose metabolism. A small number of reports have also suggested PREP participation in both male and female reproduction-associated processes. In the present work, we examined PREP distribution in male germ cells and studied the effects of its knockdown (Prep(gt/gt)) on testis and sperm in adult mice. The protein is expressed and localized in elongating spermatids and luminal spermatozoa of wild type (wt) mice, as well as Sertoli, Leydig, and peritubular cells. PREP is also expressed in the head and midpiece of epididymal spermatozoa, whereas the remaining tail region shows a weaker signal. Furthermore, testis weight, histology of seminiferous tubules, and epididymal sperm parameters were assessed in wt and Prep(gt/gt) mice: wild type testes have larger average tubule and lumen diameter; in addition, lumenal composition of seminiferous tubules is dissimilar between wt and Prep(gt/gt), as the percentage of spermiated tubules is much higher in wt. Finally, total sperm count, sperm motility, and normal morphology are also higher in wt than in Prep(gt/gt). These results show for the first time that the expression of PREP could be necessary for a correct reproductive function, and suggest that the enzyme may play a role in mouse spermatogenesis and sperm physiology.",

        "Abstract": "Regulation of energy homeostasis is fundamental for life. In animal species and humans, the Central Nervous System (CNS) plays a critical role in such regulation by integrating peripheral signals and modulating behavior and the activity of peripheral organs. A precise interplay between CNS and peripheral signals is necessary for the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure in the maintenance of energy balance. Within the CNS, the hypothalamus is a critical center for monitoring, processing and responding to peripheral signals, including hormones such as ghrelin, leptin, and insulin. Once in the brain, peripheral signals regulate neuronal systems involved in the modulation of energy homeostasis. The main hypothalamic neuronal circuit in the regulation of energy metabolism is the melanocortin system. This review will give a summary of the most recent discoveries on the hormonal regulation of the hypothalamic melanocortin system in the control of energy homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is a mitochondrial anion carrier protein, which uncouples the oxidative phosphorylation from ATP production by dissipating the proton gradient generated across the mitochondrial inner membrane. UCP2 regulates not only mitochondrial ATP production, but also the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), considered important second-messenger signals within the cell. The importance of UCP2 was firstly reported in macrophages and pancreatic beta cells. However, several studies have revealed the important role of UCP2 in the Central Nervous System (CNS) in the regulation of homeostatic mechanisms including food intake, energy expenditure, glucose homeostasis and reward behaviors. The mechanisms by which central UCP2 affect these processes seem to be associated with synaptic and mitochondrial plasticity. In this review, we will describe recent findings on central UCP2 and discuss its role in CNS regulation of homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Activation of central PPARγ promotes food intake and body weight gain; however, the identity of the neurons that express PPARγ and mediate the effect of this nuclear receptor on energy homeostasis is unknown. Here, we determined that selective ablation of PPARγ in murine proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons decreases peroxisome density, elevates reactive oxygen species, and induces leptin sensitivity in these neurons. Furthermore, ablation of PPARγ in POMC neurons preserved the interaction between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, which is dysregulated by HFD. Compared with control animals, mice lacking PPARγ in POMC neurons had increased energy expenditure and locomotor activity; reduced body weight, fat mass, and food intake; and improved glucose metabolism when exposed to high-fat diet (HFD). Finally, peripheral administration of either a PPARγ activator or inhibitor failed to affect food intake of mice with POMC-specific PPARγ ablation. Taken together, our data indicate that PPARγ mediates cellular, biological, and functional adaptations of POMC neurons to HFD, thereby regulating whole-body energy balance.",

        "Abstract": "Prolyl endopeptidase (PREP) has been implicated in neuronal functions. Here we report that hypothalamic PREP is predominantly expressed in the ventromedial nucleus (VMH), where it regulates glucose-induced neuronal activation. PREP knockdown mice (Prep(gt/gt)) exhibited glucose intolerance, decreased fasting insulin, increased fasting glucagon levels, and reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion compared with wild-type controls. Consistent with this, central infusion of a specific PREP inhibitor, S17092, impaired glucose tolerance and decreased insulin levels in wild-type mice. Arguing further for a central mode of action of PREP, isolated pancreatic islets showed no difference in glucose-induced insulin release between Prep(gt/gt) and wild-type mice. Furthermore, hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies showed no difference between Prep(gt/gt) and wild-type control mice. Central PREP regulation of insulin and glucagon secretion appears to be mediated by the autonomic nervous system because Prep(gt/gt) mice have elevated sympathetic outflow and norepinephrine levels in the pancreas, and propranolol treatment reversed glucose intolerance in these mice. Finally, re-expression of PREP by bilateral VMH injection of adeno-associated virus-PREP reversed the glucose-intolerant phenotype of the Prep(gt/gt) mice. Taken together, our results unmask a previously unknown player in central regulation of glucose metabolism and pancreatic function.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity is a metabolic state in which excess fat is accumulated in peripheral tissues, including the white adipose tissue, muscle, and liver. Sustained obesity has profound consequences on one's life, which can span from superficial psychological symptoms to serious co-morbidities that may dramatically diminish both the quality and length of life. Obesity and related metabolic disorders account for the largest financial burden on the health care system. Together, these issues make it imperative that obesity be cured or prevented. Despite the increasing wealth of knowledge on the etiology of obesity (see below), there is no successful medical strategy that is available for the vast majority of patients. We suggest that brain temperature control may be a crucial component in obesity development and that shortcutting the brain metabolic centers by hypothalamic temperature alterations in a non-invasive remote manner will provide a revolutionary approach to the treatment of obesity.",

        "Abstract": "To understand the etiology of metabolic disorders, including obesity and type II diabetes, it is essential to gain better insight into how stored and available energy sources are monitored by the central nervous system. In particular, a comprehension of the fine cellular interplay and intracellular mechanisms that enable appropriate hypothalamic and consequent endocrine and behavioral responses to both circulating hormonal and nutrient signals remains elusive. Recent data, including those from our laboratories, raised the notion that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is not merely a by-product of substrate oxidation, but it plays a crucial role in modulating cellular responses involved in the regulation of energy metabolism. These review summarizes the published recent data on the effect of ROS levels in the regulation of neuronal function, including that of hypothalamic melanocortin neurons, pro-opiomelanocortin and neuropeptide Y-/agouti related peptide-neurons, in the modulation of food intake.",

        "Abstract": "Prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP), a serine protease, is widely expressed in the body including liver, lung, kidney and brain, with a variety of known substrates such as plasma prekallikrein, bradykinin, angiotensins II and III, and α-MSH, suggesting its role in the processing of tissue-specific substrates. In the brain, PRCP has been shown to inactivate hypothalamic α-MSH, thus modulating melanocortin signaling in the control of energy metabolism. While its expression pattern has been reported in the hypothalamus, little is known on the distribution of PRCP throughout the mouse brain. This study was undertaken to determine PRCP expression in the mouse brain. Radioactive in situ hybridization was performed to determine endogenous PRCP mRNA expression. In addition, using a gene-trap mouse model for PRCP deletion, X-gal staining was performed to further determine PRCP distribution. Results from both approaches showed that PRCP gene is broadly expressed in the brain.",

        "Abstract": "Hypothalamic Prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP) plays a role in the regulation of energy metabolism by inactivating hypothalamic α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) levels and thus affecting melanocortin signaling. Alpha-MSH production is highly regulated both at transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Here we show that fasting induces a hypothalamic-specific up-regulation of Prcp mRNA and protein levels. Since fasting is characterized by elevated circulating ghrelin levels, we tested the effect of peripheral and central administration of ghrelin, and found that ghrelin increases hypothalamic Prcp mRNA expression. No changes in Prcp mRNA levels were detected in ghrelin knockout mice compared to their controls. Finally, ghrelin effect on PRCP expression was ghrelin receptor-mediated. Altogether our data show that ghrelin is a key regulator of hypothalamic PRCP expression, and up-regulation of PRCP by ghrelin may be an additional mechanism to decrease melanocortin signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus integrate a variety of central and peripheral metabolic inputs, and regulate energy homeostasis by controlling energy expenditure and food intake. To accomplish this, a precise balance of production and degradation of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), an anorexigenic neuropeptide and product of the POMC gene, in the hypothalamus, is crucial. Prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP) is a key enzyme that degrades α-MSH to an inactive form unable to inhibit food intake. Because it represents a new therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes, efforts have been made to generate potent, brain-penetrant PRCP inhibitors. Here, we discuss the role of PRCP on energy metabolism and the development of PRCP inhibitors.",

Several neuropeptides associated with learning and memory and neurodegenerative disorders have been proposed to be the substrates for PREP, suggesting a possible role for PREP in these processes. However, its physiological function remains elusive. Combining genetic, anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches, we show that PREP genetrap mice have decreased synaptic spine density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, reduced hippocampal long-term potentiation, impaired hippocampal-mediated learning and memory, and reduced growth-associated protein-43 levels when compared with wild-type controls. These observations reveal a role for PREP in mediating hippocampal plasticity and spatial memory formation, with implications for its pharmacological manipulation in diseases related to cognitive impairment.",

        "Abstract": "α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is a critical regulator of energy metabolism. Prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP) is an enzyme responsible for its degradation and inactivation. PRCP-null mice (PRCP(gt/gt)) showed elevated levels of brain α-MSH, reduced food intake, and a leaner phenotype compared with wild-type controls. In addition, they were protected against diet-induced obesity. Here, we show that PRCP(gt/gt) animals have improved metabolic parameters compared with wild-type controls under a standard chow diet (SD) as well as on a high-fat diet (HFD). Similarly to when they are exposed to SD, PRCP(gt/gt) mice exposed to HFD for 13 wk showed a leaner phenotype due to decreased fat mass, increased energy expenditure, and locomotor activity. They also showed improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance compared with WT controls and a significant reduction in fasting glucose levels. These improvements occured before changes in body weight and composition were evident, suggesting that the beneficial effect of PRCP ablation is independent of the adiposity levels. In support of a reduced gluconeogenesis, liver PEPCK and G-6-Pase mRNA levels were reduced significantly in PRCP(gt/gt) compared with WT mice. A significant decrease in liver weight and hepatic triglycerides were also observed in PRCP(gt/gt) compared with WT mice. Altogether, our data suggest that PRCP is an important regulator of energy and glucose homeostasis since its deletion significantly improves metabolic parameters in mice exposed to both SD and HFD.",

        "Abstract": "Hypothalamic α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) plays a central role in regulating energy uptake and expenditure. Prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP), a protease expressed in the hypothalamus, is responsible for the degradation of α-MSH. PRCP null animals (PRCP(gt/gt) mice) display elevated α-MSH in the hypothalamus, lower body weight, and are protected from diet induced obesity. Here, we report that PRCP(gt/gt) mice have a significant decrease in fat mass, although an increase in lean mass was also observed. In agreement with low fat accumulation, reduced leptin levels were found. Consistent with the effect of α-MSH on energy metabolism, PRCP(gt/gt) mice had increased energy expenditure with elevated circulating thyroid hormone levels and brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein 1 mRNA levels compared with control mice when exposed to regular diet. TRH mRNA levels in the PVN were significantly higher in fed PRCP(gt/gt) animals compared with fed wild-type controls. Fasting significantly decreased TRH mRNA levels in both PRCP(gt/gt) and wild-type (WT) mice. However, TRH mRNA levels in fasted PRCP(gt/gt) animals were significantly higher than those of fasted WT mice. Refeeding analysis after fasting showed a reduced food intake in PRCP(gt/gt) compared with WT mice. Finally, TRH mRNA levels in T(3)-treated hypothyroid PRCP(gt/gt) mice showed a non significant reduction compared with those of hypothyroid PRCP(gt/gt) mice, supporting the impairment of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis in PRCP(gt/gt) mice. All together, these data confirm that PRCP plays a role in the regulation of energy metabolism.",

Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) has been implicated in physiological and pathological processes related to glucose and lipid metabolism, and in this review we discuss the latest data on the relationships between UCP2 and glucose and lipid sensing from the perspective of specific hypothalamic neuronal circuits and peripheral tissue functions.

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have proposed roles for hypothalamic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the modulation of circuit activity of the melanocortin system. Here we show that suppression of ROS diminishes pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) cell activation and promotes the activity of neuropeptide Y (NPY)- and agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-co-producing (NPY/AgRP) neurons and feeding, whereas ROS-activates POMC neurons and reduces feeding. The levels of ROS in POMC neurons were positively correlated with those of leptin in lean and ob/ob mice, a relationship that was diminished in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. High-fat feeding resulted in proliferation of peroxisomes and elevated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) mRNA levels within the hypothalamus. The proliferation of peroxisomes in POMC neurons induced by the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone decreased ROS levels and increased food intake in lean mice on high-fat diet. Conversely, the suppression of peroxisome proliferation by the PPAR antagonist GW9662 increased ROS concentrations and c-fos expression in POMC neurons. Also, it reversed high-fat feeding-triggered elevated NPY/AgRP and low POMC neuronal firing, and resulted in decreased feeding of DIO mice. Finally, central administration of ROS alone increased c-fos and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pStat3) expression in POMC neurons and reduced feeding of DIO mice. These observations unmask a previously unknown hypothalamic cellular process associated with peroxisomes and ROS in the central regulation of energy metabolism in states of leptin resistance.",

        "Abstract": "The role of the central melanocortin system in the regulation of energy metabolism has received much attention during the past decade since gene mutations of key components in melanocortin signaling cause monogenic forms of obesity in animals and humans. In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus the prohormone proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is posttranslationally cleaved to produce α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a peptide with anorexigenic effects upon activation of the melanocortin receptors (MCRs). α-MSH undergoes extensive post-translational processing and its in vivo activity is short lived due to rapid degradation. The enzymatic process that controls α-MSH inactivation is incompletely understood. Recent evidence suggests that prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP) is an enzyme responsible for α-MSH degradation. As for many key melanocortin peptides, gene mutation of PRCP causes a change in the metabolic phenotype of rodents. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the melanocortin system with particular focus on PRCP, a newly discovered component of the melanocortin system.",

        "Abstract": "Changes in circulating hormones, such as leptin and ghrelin, induce alterations in synaptic input organization and electrophysiological properties of neurons of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. To assess whether changes in circulating glucocorticoids also alter synaptic arrangement and membrane potential properties, we studied the effect of adrenalectomy (ADX) and corticosterone replacement in mice on the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. ADX reduced the number of symmetric, putative inhibitory synapses onto POMC neurons and the number of asymmetric, putative excitatory synapses onto NPY/AgRP neurons. Corticosterone replacement in ADX mice to levels similar to sham-operated animals restored the number of synapses onto POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons to that seen in sham-operated controls. The alterations in the synaptic arrangement in ADX mice were not due to their decrease in food intake as evidenced by the synaptic analysis of the pair-fed control animals. In line with the altered synaptic input organization, a depolarization of POMC membrane potential and a hyperpolarization of NPY/AgRP membrane potential were observed in ADX mice compared with their sham-operated controls. All of these changes reverted upon corticosterone replacement. These results reveal that the known orexigenic action of corticosteroids is mediated, at least in part, by synaptic changes and altered excitability of the melanocortin system.",

In the brain, POMC is processed to form several peptides including alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). alpha-MSH is expressed in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and in the nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem where it has a crucial role in the regulation of metabolic functions. Specifically, α-MSH is an anorexigenic peptide. Its production and maturation processes have been shown to be regulated according to the metabolic condition of the organism.

        "Abstract": "The anorexigenic neuromodulator alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH; referred to here as alpha-MSH1-13) undergoes extensive posttranslational processing, and its in vivo activity is short lived due to rapid inactivation. The enzymatic control of alpha-MSH1-13 maturation and inactivation is incompletely understood. Here we have provided insight into alpha-MSH1-13 inactivation through the generation and analysis of a subcongenic mouse strain with reduced body fat compared with controls. Using positional cloning, we identified a maximum of 6 coding genes, including that encoding prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP), in the donor region. Real-time PCR revealed a marked genotype effect on Prcp mRNA expression in brain tissue. Biochemical studies using recombinant PRCP demonstrated that PRCP removes the C-terminal amino acid of alpha-MSH1-13, producing alpha-MSH1-12, which is not neuroactive. We found that Prcp was expressed in the hypothalamus in neuronal populations that send efferents to areas where alpha-MSH1-13 is released from axon terminals. The inhibition of PRCP activity by small molecule protease inhibitors administered peripherally or centrally decreased food intake in both wild-type and obese mice. Furthermore, Prcp-null mice had elevated levels of alpha-MSH1-13 in the hypothalamus and were leaner and shorter than the wild-type controls on a regular chow diet; they were also resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity. Our results suggest that PRCP is an important component of melanocortin signaling and weight maintenance via control of active alpha-MSH1-13 levels.",

        "Abstract": "Brain-derived ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) have been known as plasma membrane-incorporated enzymes with their ATP-hydrolyzing domain outside of the cell. As such, these enzymes are thought to regulate purinergic intercellular signaling by hydrolyzing ATP to ADP-AMP, thus regulating the availability of specific ligands for various P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors. The role of NTPDases in the central nervous system is little understood. The two major reasons are the insufficient knowledge of the precise localization of these enzymes in neural structures, and the lack of specific inhibitors for the various NTPDases. To fill these gaps, we recently studied the presence of neuron-specific NTPDase3 in the mitochondria of hypothalamic excitatory neurons by morphological and functional methods. Results from those studies suggested that intramitochondrial regulation of ATP levels may play a permissive role in the neural regulation of physiological functions by tuning the level of ATP-carried energy that is needed for neuronal functions, such as neurotransmission and/or intracellular signaling.",

        "Abstract": "The hypothalamus plays a major part in regulating energy homeostasis by integrating hormonal and nutritional signals. Increasing evidence shows that specific neurons in the hypothalamus respond to changing glucose, lipid and amino acid levels. However, the intracellular substrate for such 'fuel sensing' and its integration into the neuronal doctrine as it relates to energy homeostasis remains elusive. Evidence points to differential fuel utilization in response to nutrient availability and free radical formation as crucial components in regulating neuronal functions. This review places these components in the context of neurobiological aspects of circuit-specific hypothalamic output, focusing on the melanocortin system. The effects of glucose and fatty acids are discussed with emphasis on free radical production in orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons of the arcuate nucleus.",

        "Abstract": "The gut-derived hormone ghrelin exerts its effect on the brain by regulating neuronal activity. Ghrelin-induced feeding behaviour is controlled by arcuate nucleus neurons that co-express neuropeptide Y and agouti-related protein (NPY/AgRP neurons). However, the intracellular mechanisms triggered by ghrelin to alter NPY/AgRP neuronal activity are poorly understood. Here we show that ghrelin initiates robust changes in hypothalamic mitochondrial respiration in mice that are dependent on uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Activation of this mitochondrial mechanism is critical for ghrelin-induced mitochondrial proliferation and electric activation of NPY/AgRP neurons, for ghrelin-triggered synaptic plasticity of pro-opiomelanocortin-expressing neurons, and for ghrelin-induced food intake. The UCP2-dependent action of ghrelin on NPY/AgRP neurons is driven by a hypothalamic fatty acid oxidation pathway involving AMPK, CPT1 and free radicals that are scavenged by UCP2. These results reveal a signalling modality connecting mitochondria-mediated effects of G-protein-coupled receptors on neuronal function and associated behaviour.",

        "Abstract": "Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is upregulated in the brain after sublethal ischemia, and overexpression of UCP2 is neuroprotective in several models of neurodegenerative disease. We investigated if increased levels of UCP2 diminished neuronal damage after global brain ischemia by subjecting mice overexpressing UCP2 (UCP2/3tg) and wild-type littermates (wt) to a 12-min global ischemia. The histopathological outcome in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus was evaluated at 4 days of recovery, allowing maturation of the selective neuronal death. Global ischemia led to extensive cell death in the striatum, thalamus, and in the CA1 and CA2, and less-pronounced cell death in the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal subfields. Histologic damage was significantly lower in the ventral posterolateral VPL and medial VPM thalamic nuclei in UCP2/3tg animals compared with wt. These thalamic regions showed a larger increase in UCP2 expression in UCP2/3tg compared with wt animals relative to the nonprotected DG. In the other regions studied, the histologic damage was lower or equal in UCP2/3tg animals compared with wt. Consequently, neuroprotection in the thalamus correlated with a high expression of UCP2, which is neuroprotective in a number of models of neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Secreted from adipose tissue at levels proportional to fat stores, the hormone leptin is a critical regulator of the hypothalamic machinery that controls feeding and energy metabolism. Despite the critical role of leptin in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, no leptin-based therapeutic approaches have emerged to combat metabolic disorders such as obesity or diabetes. In this issue of the JCI, Xu et al. report a robust influence of leptin, beyond its role in metabolism, on hippocampal neuronal processes implicated in the etiology of epileptic seizures, learning, and memory (see the related article beginning on page 272). They show, in two rodent seizure models, that leptin administered directly to the brain or nasal epithelium suppresses seizures via direct effects on glutamate neurotransmission in the hippocampus. These observations suggest that leptin may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of epilepsy and strengthen the notion that peripheral metabolic hormones such as leptin play important roles in the regulation of higher brain functions.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past century, the hypothalamus has emerged as one of the critical sites involved in energy homeostasis. Degeneration studies in rats performed some six decades ago, first led to identifying hypothalamic subregions controlling food intake and body weight. The idea that the central nervous system (CNS), and the hypothalamus in particular, are key in metabolism regulation was reinforced by the discovery of leptin in 1994. Since the identification of leptin, enormous progress has been made in the understanding of the regulation of hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic brain regions that control food intake and energy expenditure by peripheral signals such as hormones. An important challenge is to decipher these complicated interactions between peripheral signals and neuronal circuits to better understand the etiology of metabolic disorders and to identify opportunities to intervene with pharmacological treatment. In this review, we focus on the hormonal regulation of the neuronal circuits of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus: the melanocortin system.",

Type 2 deiodinase (DII), an enzyme that catalyzes active thyroid hormone production, and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) are also present in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, where their interaction and physiological significance have not been explored. Here, we report that DII-producing glial cells are in direct apposition to neurons coexpressing neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AgRP), and UCP2. Fasting increased DII activity and local thyroid hormone production in the arcuate nucleus in parallel with increased GDP-regulated UCP2-dependent mitochondrial uncoupling. Fasting-induced T3-mediated UCP2 activation resulted in mitochondrial proliferation in NPY/AgRP neurons, an event that was critical for increased excitability of these orexigenic neurons and consequent rebound feeding following food deprivation. These results reveal a physiological role for a thyroid-hormone-regulated mitochondrial uncoupling in hypothalamic neuronal networks.",

        "Abstract": "The gut hormone and neuropeptide ghrelin affects energy balance and growth hormone release through hypothalamic action that involves synaptic plasticity in the melanocortin system. Ghrelin binding is also present in other brain areas, including the telencephalon, where its function remains elusive. Here we report that circulating ghrelin enters the hippocampus and binds to neurons of the hippocampal formation, where it promotes dendritic spine synapse formation and generation of long-term potentiation. These ghrelin-induced synaptic changes are paralleled by enhanced spatial learning and memory. Targeted disruption of the gene that encodes ghrelin resulted in decreased numbers of spine synapses in the CA1 region and impaired performance of mice in behavioral memory testing, both of which were rapidly reversed by ghrelin administration. Our observations reveal an endogenous function of ghrelin that links metabolic control with higher brain functions and suggest novel therapeutic strategies to enhance learning and memory processes.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial uncoupling mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is classically associated with non-shivering thermogenesis by brown fat. Recent evidence indicates that UCP family proteins are also present in selected neurons. Unlike UCP1, these proteins (UCP2, UCP4 and BMCP1/UCP5) are not constitutive uncouplers and are not crucial for non-shivering thermogenesis. However, they can be activated by free radicals and free fatty acids, and their activity has a profound influence on neuronal function. By regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, calcium flux, free radical production and local temperature, neuronal UCPs can directly influence neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative processes. Insights into the regulation and function of these proteins offer unsuspected avenues for a better understanding of synaptic transmission and neurodegeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Fasting is characterized by disrupted thyroid feedback, with suppressed levels of thyroid hormones and paraventricular thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). We found that third ventricle administration of the deiodinase inhibitor, iopanoic acid, dose-dependently reduced deiodinase type II (DII) activity selectively in the hypothalamus. This suppression of DII by iopanoic acid during fasting prevented elevated DII activity and blunted the decline in hypothalamic TRH mRNA levels. Because fasting-induced elevation in hypothalamic DII activity is paralleled by increased hypothalamic T3 concentration, our study suggests that T3 formation by DII in the hypothalamus is the cause of disrupted thyroid feedback during fasting.",

        "Abstract": "During food deprivation, plasma T(4) and T(3) levels are decreased. Under this metabolic condition, hypothalamic deiodinase type 2 (D2) activity and mRNA levels are elevated, whereas TRH mRNA levels are suppressed. Systemic T(4) administration does not reverse these hypothalamic changes. The mechanism(s) that underlies this paradoxical regulation of D2 during fasting is unknown. We hypothesize that leptin and/or glucocorticoids play a role in these mechanisms, and their interactions may be an important regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Thus, we assessed the effects of these hormones on D2 activity levels of food-deprived as well as fed animals using enzyme activity measurements. In food-deprived animals, corticosterone replacement reversed the inhibitory effect of adrenalectomy (ADX) on D2 induction, whereas ADX and ADX plus corticosterone replacement did not significantly affect D2 activity levels in rats fed ad libitum. Leptin administration to fed animals did not change D2 activity, whereas in fasted rats, leptin decreased D2 activity by reducing corticosterone plasma levels. When leptin was administered to fasted animals that were either ADX or ADX plus corticosterone treated at a high dose, D2 activity did not increase. Our results show that during fasting, diminishing leptin levels play a permissive role to enable glucocorticoid-induced up-regulation of D2. Thus, our observations suggest that appropriate induction of D2 activity during negative energy balance is dependent upon both leptin and glucocorticoid signaling.",

        "Abstract": "The hypothalamic neuropeptides hypocretins (orexins) play a crucial role in the stability of arousal and alertness. We tested whether the hypocretinergic system is a critical component of the stress response activated by the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Our results show that CRF-immunoreactive terminals make direct contact with hypocretin-expressing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and that numerous hypocretinergic neurons express the CRF-R1/2 receptors. We also demonstrate that application of CRF to hypothalamic slices containing identified hypocretin neurons depolarizes membrane potential and increases firing rate in a subpopulation of hypocretinergic cells. CRF-induced depolarization was tetrodotoxin insensitive and was blocked by the peptidergic CRF-R1 antagonist astressin. Moreover, activation of hypocretinergic neurons in response to acute stress was severely impaired in CRF-R1 knock-out mice. Together, our data provide evidence of a direct neuroanatomical and physiological input from CRF peptidergic system onto hypocretin neurons. We propose that, after stressor stimuli, CRF stimulates the release of hypocretins and that this circuit contributes to activation and maintenance of arousal associated with the stress response.",

        "Abstract": "For decades, increasingly sophisticated methods have been designed to address the problem of the involvement of the brain in the physiology of energy homeostasis and the pathogenesis of obesity. A vast number of experimental observations have been made from novel genetic and physiologic approaches that allowed the identification of metabolic hormones and their relationship to key peptidergic systems in the brain. Although the central integration of afferent signals reflecting acute and chronic energy requirements is becoming clearer, the blueprint of the central regulation of energy expenditure is not known. This review offers a look at central neuronal circuitries that are implicated in metabolism regulation and strongly suggests that without a blueprint, attempts to intervene and control energy balance will remain futile.",

        "Abstract": "The mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP2) is expressed in selected regions of the brain. Here we demonstrate that up-regulation of UCP2 is part of a neuroprotective set of responses to various cellular stresses in vitro and in vivo. PC12 cells, when transfected with UCP2, were protected against free radical-induced cell death. Seizure activity was associated with elevated UCP2 levels and mitochondrial uncoupling activity. In transgenic mice that expressed UCP2 constitutively in the hippocampus before seizure induction, a robust reduction in cell death was seen. Because UCP2 increased mitochondrial number and ATP levels with a parallel decrease in free radical-induced damage, it is reasonable to suggest that mitochondrial UCPs precondition neurons by dissociating cellular energy production from that of free radicals to withstand the harmful effects of cellular stress occurring in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including epilepsy.",

        "Abstract": "In rodents, hypocretin (HCRT, also called orexin) influences a variety of endocrine, autonomic, and metabolic functions. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the HCRT-producing circuit is involved in the hypothalamic regulation of homeostasis in primates as well. We studied female monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) that were either fed or fasted for 24 h. Immunocytochemistry revealed HCRT-producing perikarya exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus-perifornical region and dorsomedial hypothalamus of the monkey brain. HCRT axons and axon terminals were present in different parts of the hypothalamus and adjacent forebrain and thalamic nuclei. The 24-h fast resulted in an approximately 50% decline in circulating leptin levels and significantly elevated c-fos expression in the perifornical region; in the dorsomedial, ventromedial, and arcuate nuclei; and in the medial preoptic area. In the dorsomedial nucleus and perifornical region of fasted monkeys, three times more HCRT-neurons expressed nuclear c-fos than those of the normally fed controls. Neurons in different parts of the hypothalamus and basal forebrain that expressed c-fos, but did not contain HCRT, were targets of HCRT-immunopositive boutons establishing asymmetric synapses. In the arcuate nucleus, subsets of these HCRT-targeted c-fos-expressing cells contained neuropeptide Y. The present study provides the first experimental evidence to implicate HCRT in the hypothalamic regulation of homeostasis in primates. The fact that these lateral hypothalamic cells have leptin receptors and can be activated by a metabolic challenge and that they innervate diverse brain regions indicates that the HCRT system may be a key integrator of environmental cues in their regulation of diverse brain activity.",

The first of these proteins, UCP1, was discovered in brown adipose tissue, where it has a well-described role in thermogenesis. The functional significance of other UCPs, including UCP2, is less well understood. Here we summarize the recent advancements on the role of UCP2 in the brain and portray this uncoupler as an important player in normal neuronal function as well as a key cell death-suppressing device. These previously unknown functions of UCPs offer new avenues not only for the better understanding of these proteins but also for the furthering of our knowledge on the central nervous system in healthy and disease states.",

        "Abstract": "The novel peptide hormone ghrelin has recently been recognized as an important co-regulator of growth hormone secretion and energy homeostasis. The significance of ghrelin for obesity and cachexia as well as in the regulation of growth processes is the subject of ongoing basic research as well as clinical studies. It is our goal to emphasize the critical significance of the hypothalamic signaling modalities induced by ghrelin for a better understanding of how this novel hormone affects energy balance and metabolism.",

        "Title": "The distribution and mechanism of action of ghrelin in the CNS demonstrates a novel hypothalamic circuit regulating energy homeostasis.",
        "Abstract": "The gastrointestinal peptide hormone ghrelin stimulates appetite in rodents and humans via hypothalamic actions. We discovered expression of ghrelin in a previously uncharacterized group of neurons adjacent to the third ventricle between the dorsal, ventral, paraventricular, and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei. These neurons send efferents onto key hypothalamic circuits, including those producing neuropeptide Y (NPY), Agouti-related protein (AGRP), proopiomelanocortin (POMC) products, and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Within the hypothalamus, ghrelin bound mostly on presynaptic terminals of NPY neurons. Using electrophysiological recordings, we found that ghrelin stimulated the activity of arcuate NPY neurons and mimicked the effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). We propose that at these sites, release of ghrelin may stimulate the release of orexigenic peptides and neurotransmitters, thus representing a novel regulatory circuit controlling energy homeostasis.",

One of these proteins, UCP2, is also expressed in neurons of subcortical brain regions of healthy subjects.
