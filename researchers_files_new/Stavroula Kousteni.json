        "Abstract": "The skeleton is traditionally known for its structural support, organ protection, movement, and maintenance of mineral homeostasis. Over the last 10 years, bone has emerged as an endocrine organ with diverse physiological functions. The two key molecules in this context are fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), secreted by osteocytes, and osteocalcin, a hormone produced by osteoblasts. FGF23 affects mineral homeostasis through its actions on the kidneys, and osteocalcin has beneficial effects in improving glucose homeostasis, muscle function, brain development, cognition, and male fertility. In addition, another osteoblast-derived hormone, lipocalin 2 (LCN2) has emerged into the researchers' field of vision. In this review, we mainly focus on LCN2's role in appetite regulation and glucose metabolism and also briefly introduce its effects in other pathophysiological conditions, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, sarcopenic obesity, and cancer-induced cachexia.",

        "Abstract": "The various functions of the skeleton are influenced by extracellular cues, hormones, and neurotransmitters. One type of neuronal regulation favors bone mass accrual by inhibiting sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. This observation raises questions about the transcriptional mechanisms regulating catecholamine synthesis. Using a combination of genetic and pharmacological studies, we found that the histone deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a transcriptional modulator of the neuronal control of bone mass. Neuronal SIRT1 reduced bone mass by increasing SNS signaling. SIRT1 did so by increasing expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), a SIRT1 target that reduces brain serotonin levels by inducing its catabolism and by suppressing tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) expression and serotonin synthesis in the brain stem. SIRT1 upregulated brain catecholamine synthesis indirectly through serotonin, but did not directly affect dopamine β hydroxylase (Dbh) expression in the locus coeruleus. These results help us to understand skeletal changes associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and may have implications for treating skeletal and metabolic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Remodeling of the microenvironment by tumor cells can activate pathways that favor cancer growth. Molecular delineation and targeting of such malignant-cell nonautonomous pathways may help overcome resistance to targeted therapies. Herein we leverage genetic mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples to show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exploits peripheral serotonin signaling to remodel the endosteal niche to its advantage. AML progression requires the presence of serotonin receptor 1B (HTR1B) in osteoblasts and is driven by AML-secreted kynurenine, which acts as an oncometabolite and HTR1B ligand. AML cells utilize kynurenine to induce a proinflammatory state in osteoblasts that, through the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA), acts in a positive feedback loop on leukemia cells by increasing expression of IDO1-the rate-limiting enzyme for kynurenine synthesis-thereby enabling AML progression. This leukemia-osteoblast cross-talk, conferred by the kynurenine-HTR1B-SAA-IDO1 axis, could be exploited as a niche-focused therapeutic approach against AML, opening new avenues for cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "In the mouse, the osteoblast-derived hormone Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) suppresses food intake and acts as a satiety signal. We show here that meal challenges increase serum LCN2 levels in persons with normal or overweight, but not in individuals with obesity. Postprandial LCN2 serum levels correlate inversely with hunger sensation in challenged subjects. We further show through brain PET scans of monkeys injected with radiolabeled recombinant human LCN2 (rh-LCN2) and autoradiography in baboon, macaque, and human brain sections, that LCN2 crosses the blood-brain barrier and localizes to the hypothalamus in primates. In addition, daily treatment of lean monkeys with rh-LCN2 decreases food intake by 21%, without overt side effects. These studies demonstrate the biology of LCN2 as a satiety factor and indicator and anorexigenic signal in primates. Failure to stimulate postprandial LCN2 in individuals with obesity may contribute to metabolic dysregulation, suggesting that LCN2 may be a novel target for obesity treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Regulation of food intake is a recently identified endocrine function of bone that is mediated by Lipocalin-2 (LCN2). Osteoblast-secreted LCN2 suppresses appetite and decreases fat mass while improving glucose metabolism. We now show that serum LCN2 levels correlate with insulin levels and β-cell function, indices of healthy glucose metabolism, in obese mice and obese, prediabetic women. However, LCN2 serum levels also correlate with body mass index and insulin resistance in the same individuals and are increased in obese mice. To dissect this apparent discrepancy, we modulated LCN2 levels in mice. Silencing Lcn2 expression worsens metabolic dysfunction in genetic and diet-induced obese mice. Conversely, increasing circulating LCN2 levels improves metabolic parameters and promotes β-cell function in mouse models of β-cell failure acting as a growth factor necessary for β-cell adaptation to higher metabolic load. These results indicate that LCN2 up-regulation is a protective mechanism to counteract obesity-induced glucose intolerance by decreasing food intake and promoting adaptive β-cell proliferation.",

It is clear that disruption of the normal bone marrow microenvironment is sufficient to promote leukemic transformation and survival in both a cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous manner. In this review, we provide a snapshot of the various cell types shown to contribute to the leukemic microenvironment as well as treatment resistance. Several of these studies suggest that leukemic blasts occupy specific cellular and biochemical \"niches.\" Effective dissection of critical leukemic niche components using single-cell approaches has allowed a more precise and extensive characterization of complexity that underpins both the healthy and malignant bone marrow microenvironment. Knowledge gained from these observations can have an important impact in the development of microenvironment-directed targeted approaches aimed at mitigating disease relapse.",

These interactions provide instructive cues that influence the production and lineage determination of different types of blood cells and maintenance of HSC quiescence. They also contribute to hematopoietic deregulation and hematological myeloid malignancies. Alterations in the BM niche are commonly observed in myeloid malignancies and contribute to the aberrant function of myelodysplastic and leukemia-initiating stem cells. In this work, we review how different components of the BM niche affect normal hematopoiesis, the molecular signals that govern this interaction, and how genetic changes in stromal cells or alterations in remodeled malignant BM niches contribute to myeloid malignancies. Understanding the intricacies between normal and malignant niches and their modulation may provide insights into developing novel therapeutics for blood disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Bone has recently emerged as a pleiotropic endocrine organ that secretes at least two hormones, FGF23 and osteocalcin, which regulate kidney function and glucose homeostasis, respectively. These findings have raised the question of whether other bone-derived hormones exist and what their potential functions are. Here we identify, through molecular and genetic analyses in mice, lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as an osteoblast-enriched, secreted protein. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in mice demonstrate that osteoblast-derived LCN2 maintains glucose homeostasis by inducing insulin secretion and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In addition, osteoblast-derived LCN2 inhibits food intake. LCN2 crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the paraventricular and ventromedial neurons of the hypothalamus and activates an MC4R-dependent anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) pathway. These results identify LCN2 as a bone-derived hormone with metabolic regulatory effects, which suppresses appetite in a MC4R-dependent manner, and show that the control of appetite is an endocrine function of bone.",

        "Title": "IGF-1 Receptor Expression on Circulating Osteoblast Progenitor Cells Predicts Tissue-Based Bone Formation Rate and Response to Teriparatide in Premenopausal Women With Idiopathic Osteoporosis.",
        "Abstract": "We have previously reported that premenopausal women with idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) have profound microarchitectural deficiencies and heterogeneous bone remodeling. Those with the lowest bone formation rate have higher baseline serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and less robust response to teriparatide. Because IGF-1 stimulates bone formation and is critical for teriparatide action on osteoblasts, these findings suggest a state of IGF-1 resistance in some IOP women. To further investigate the hypothesis that osteoblast and IGF-1-related mechanisms mediate differential responsiveness to teriparatide in IOP, we studied circulating osteoblast progenitor (COP) cells and their IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression. In premenopausal women with IOP, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained at baseline (n = 25) and over 24 months of teriparatide treatment (n = 11). Flow cytometry was used to identify and quantify COPs (non-hematopoetic lineage cells expressing osteocalcin and RUNX2) and to quantify IGF-1R expression levels. At baseline, both the percent of PBMCs that were COPs (%COP) and COP cell-surface IGF-1R expression correlated directly with several histomorphometric indices of bone formation in tetracycline-labeled transiliac biopsies. In treated subjects, both %COP and IGF-1R expression increased promptly after teriparatide, returning toward baseline by 18 months. Although neither baseline %COP nor increase in %COP after 3 months predicted the bone mineral density (BMD) response to teriparatide, the percent increase in IGF-1R expression on COPs at 3 months correlated directly with the BMD response to teriparatide. Additionally, lower IGF-1R expression after teriparatide was associated with higher body fat, suggesting links between teriparatide resistance, body composition, and the GH/IGF-1 axis. In conclusion, these assays may be useful to characterize bone remodeling noninvasively and may serve to predict early response to teriparatide and possibly other bone formation-stimulating medications. These new tools may also have utility in the mechanistic investigation of teriparatide resistance in premenopausal IOP and perhaps in other populations. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

        "Title": "Normal hematopoiesis and lack of β-catenin activation in osteoblasts of patients and mice harboring Lrp5 gain-of-function mutations.",
        "Abstract": "Osteoblasts are emerging regulators of myeloid malignancies since genetic alterations in them, such as constitutive activation of β-catenin, instigate their appearance. The LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), initially proposed to be a co-receptor for Wnt proteins, in fact favors bone formation by suppressing gut-serotonin synthesis. This function of Lrp5 occurring in the gut is independent of β-catenin activation in osteoblasts. However, it is unknown whether Lrp5 can act directly in osteoblast to influence other functions that require β-catenin signaling, particularly, the deregulation of hematopoiesis and leukemogenic properties of β-catenin activation in osteoblasts, that lead to development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using mice with gain-of-function (GOF) Lrp5 alleles (Lrp5(A214V)) that recapitulate the human high bone mass (HBM) phenotype, as well as patients with the T253I HBM Lrp5 mutation, we show here that Lrp5 GOF mutations in both humans and mice do not activate β-catenin signaling in osteoblasts. Consistent with a lack of β-catenin activation in their osteoblasts, Lrp5(A214V) mice have normal trilinear hematopoiesis. In contrast to leukemic mice with constitutive activation of β-catenin in osteoblasts (Ctnnb1(CAosb)), accumulation of early myeloid progenitors, a characteristic of AML, myeloid-blasts in blood, and segmented neutrophils or dysplastic megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, are not observed in Lrp5(A214V) mice. Likewise, peripheral blood count analysis in HBM patients showed normal hematopoiesis, normal percentage of myeloid cells, and lack of anemia. We conclude that Lrp5 GOF mutations do not activate β-catenin signaling in osteoblasts. As a result, myeloid lineage differentiation is normal in HBM patients and mice.

        "Abstract": "The bone marrow niche is thought to act as a permissive microenvironment required for emergence or progression of hematologic cancers. We hypothesized that osteoblasts, components of the niche involved in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function, influence the fate of leukemic blasts. We show that osteoblast numbers decrease by 55% in myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia patients. Further, genetic depletion of osteoblasts in mouse models of acute leukemia increased circulating blasts and tumor engraftment in the marrow and spleen leading to higher tumor burden and shorter survival. Myelopoiesis increased and was coupled with a reduction in B lymphopoiesis and compromised erythropoiesis, suggesting that hematopoietic lineage/progression was altered. Treatment of mice with acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia with a pharmacologic inhibitor of the synthesis of duodenal serotonin, a hormone suppressing osteoblast numbers, inhibited loss of osteoblasts. Maintenance of the osteoblast pool restored normal marrow function, reduced tumor burden, and prolonged survival. Leukemia prevention was attributable to maintenance of osteoblast numbers because inhibition of serotonin receptors alone in leukemic blasts did not affect leukemia progression. These results suggest that osteoblasts play a fundamental role in propagating leukemia in the marrow and may be a therapeutic target to induce hostility of the niche to leukemia blasts.",

        "Abstract": "Cells of the osteoblast lineage affect the homing and the number of long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells, haematopoietic stem cell mobilization and lineage determination and B cell lymphopoiesis. Osteoblasts were recently implicated in pre-leukaemic conditions in mice. However, a single genetic change in osteoblasts that can induce leukaemogenesis has not been shown. Here we show that an activating mutation of β-catenin in mouse osteoblasts alters the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors leading to development of acute myeloid leukaemia with common chromosomal aberrations and cell autonomous progression. Activated β-catenin stimulates expression of the Notch ligand jagged 1 in osteoblasts. Subsequent activation of Notch signalling in haematopoietic stem cell progenitors induces the malignant changes. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling ameliorates acute myeloid leukaemia and demonstrates the pathogenic role of the Notch pathway. In 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, increased β-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation was identified in osteoblasts and these patients showed increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that genetic alterations in osteoblasts can induce acute myeloid leukaemia, identify molecular signals leading to this transformation and suggest a potential novel pharmacotherapeutic approach to acute myeloid leukaemia.",

In this Review, we examine the features of these new endocrine pathways and discuss their physiological importance in the context of our current understanding of energy metabolism and mineral homeostasis. Consideration of evolutionary and comparative biology provides clues that a key driving force for the emergence of these hormonal pathways was the development of a large, energy-expensive musculoskeletal system. Specialized bone cells also evolved and produced endocrine hormones to integrate the skeleton in global mineral and nutrient homeostasis. The recognition of bone as a true endocrine organ represents a fertile area for further research and should improve the diagnosis and treatment of metabolic diseases such as osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus.",

        "Abstract": "Serotonin is a critical regulator of bone mass, fulfilling different functions depending on its site of synthesis. Brain-derived serotonin promotes osteoblast proliferation, whereas duodenal-derived serotonin suppresses it. To understand the molecular mechanisms of duodenal-derived serotonin action on osteoblasts, we explored its transcriptional mediation in mice. We found that the transcription factor FOXO1 is a crucial determinant of the effects of duodenum-derived serotonin on bone formation We identified two key FOXO1 complexes in osteoblasts, one with the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB) and another with activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Under normal levels of circulating serotonin, the proliferative activity of FOXO1 was promoted by a balance between its interaction with CREB and ATF4. However, high circulating serotonin levels prevented the association of FOXO1 with CREB, resulting in suppressed osteoblast proliferation. These observations identify FOXO1 as the molecular node of an intricate transcriptional machinery that confers the signal of duodenal-derived serotonin to inhibit bone formation.",

        "Abstract": "The Forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 inhibits through its expression in osteoblasts β-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and sensitivity. At least part of the FoxO1 metabolic functions result from its ability to suppress the activity of osteocalcin, an osteoblast-derived hormone favoring glucose metabolism and energy expenditure. In searching for mechanisms mediating the metabolic actions of FoxO1, we focused on ATF4, because this transcription factor also affects glucose metabolism through its expression in osteoblasts. We show here that FoxO1 co-localizes with ATF4 in the osteoblast nucleus, and physically interacts with and promotes the transcriptional activity of ATF4. Genetic experiments demonstrate that FoxO1 and ATF4 cooperate to increase glucose levels and decrease glucose tolerance. These effects result from a synergistic effect of the two transcription factors to suppress the activity of osteocalcin through up-regulating expression of the phosphatase catalyzing osteocalcin inactivation. As a result, insulin production by β-cells and insulin signaling in the muscle, liver and white adipose tissue are compromised and fat weight increases by the FoxO1/ATF4 interaction. Taken together these observations demonstrate that FoxO1 and ATF4 cooperate in osteoblasts to regulate glucose homeostasis.",

        "Title": "FoxO1, the transcriptional chief of staff of energy metabolism.",
        "Abstract": "FoxO1, one of the four FoxO isoforms of Forkhead transcription factors, is highly expressed in insulin-responsive tissues, including pancreas, liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, as well as in the skeleton. In all these tissues FoxO1 orchestrates the transcriptional cascades regulating glucose metabolism. Indeed, FoxO1 is a major target of insulin which inhibits its transcriptional activity via nuclear exclusion. In the pancreas, FoxO1 regulates β-cell formation and function by a balanced dual mode of action that suppresses β-cell proliferation but promotes survival. Hepatic glucose production is promoted and lipid metabolism is regulated by FoxO1 such that under insulin resistance they lead to hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, two features of type 2 diabetes. In skeletal muscle FoxO1 maintains energy homeostasis during fasting and provides energy supply through breakdown of carbohydrates, a process that leads to atrophy and underlies glycemic control in insulin resistance. In a dual function, FoxO1 regulates energy and nutrient homeostasis through energy storage in white adipose tissue, but promotes energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue. In its most recently discovered novel role, FoxO1 acts as a transcriptional link between the skeleton and pancreas as well as other insulin target tissues to regulate energy homeostasis. Through its expression in osteoblasts it controls glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure. In a feedback mode of regulation, FoxO1 is also a target of insulin signaling in osteoblasts. Insulin suppresses activity of osteoblastic FoxO1 thus promoting beneficial effects of osteoblasts on glucose metabolism. The multiple actions of FoxO1 in all glucose-regulating organs, along with clinical studies suggesting that its glycemic properties are conserved in humans, establish this transcription factor as a master regulator of energy metabolism across species.",

        "Title": "Genetic evidence points to an osteocalcin-independent influence of osteoblasts on energy metabolism.",
        "Abstract": "The skeleton has been shown recently to regulate glucose metabolism through an osteoblast-specific hormone, osteocalcin, which favors β-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, and energy expenditure. An implication of this finding is that a decrease in osteoblast numbers would compromise glucose metabolism in an osteocalcin-dependent manner. To test this hypothesis, osteoblasts were inducibly ablated by cross-breeding transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-regulated Cre under the control of the osteocalcin promoter with mice in which an inactive form of the diphtheria toxin A chain was introduced into a ubiquitously expressed locus. Ablation of osteoblasts in adult mice profoundly affected glucose metabolism. In a manner similar to what is seen in the case of osteocalcin deficiency, a partial ablation of this cell population resulted in hypoinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and decreased insulin sensitivity. However, and unlike what is seen in osteocalcin-deficient mice, osteoblast ablation also decreased gonadal fat and increased energy expenditure and the expression of resistin, an adipokine proposed to mediate insulin resistance. While administration of osteocalcin reversed (fully) the glucose intolerance and reinstated normal blood glucose and insulin levels, it only partially restored insulin sensitivity and did not affect the improved gonadal fat weight and energy expenditure in osteoblast-depleted mice. These observations not only strengthen the notion that osteoblasts are necessary for glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure but also suggest that in addition to osteocalcin, other osteoblast-derived hormones may contribute to the emerging function of the skeleton as a regulator of energy metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "The FoxO family of forkhead transcription factors is at the crossroads of many signal transduction pathways that are evolutionarily conserved. Such pathways have been co-opted in differentiated tissues for a variety of vital and specialized functions, such as differentiation, proliferation, and survival in cells as diverse as adipocytes, hepatocytes, β-cells, myoblasts, thymocytes, and cancer cells. FoxO metabolic functions are relevant to glucose metabolism, tumor suppression, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and antioxidant defense. Among the FoxO isoforms, FoxO1 is a main target of insulin signaling and regulates metabolic homeostasis and organismal survival at many different levels. FoxO1 entered into the field of skeletal biology by a property that is unique among its functions in other organs. With the osteoblast as its target cell, FoxO1 not only acts on it to regulate bone homeostasis but also through it as a transcriptional modulator of the endocrine function of the skeleton in regulating glucose metabolism. Through its direct skeletal actions, FoxO1 promotes osteoblast proliferation by maintaining protein synthesis and redox balance. Through its endocrine actions on target tissues of insulin, FoxO1 acts by way of osteocalcin to suppress glucose production by pancreatic beta cells and hepatocytes and to decrease insulin production and sensitivity. These two parallel but opposing actions, one in favor of the skeleton and the other in disadvantage of glucose-regulating tissues, may signify an adaptive mechanism that integrates responses between different organs and is beneficial for whole-body physiology during stress and aging.",

        "Abstract": "Several mechanisms contribute to the decline of all physiologic functions during aging. As a consequence, disease incidence increases with age. Central to this multifactorial process is the increase in oxidative stress levels, which correlates with age-related disease pathogenesis in animal models and in humans. Accordingly, skeletal aging and aging-related bone diseases are also associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species. In a variety of organs, including the skeleton, mutations in components of antioxidant defense pathways have been found to lead to progressive degenerative diseases. The molecules involved are highly conserved, can sense and respond to increases in oxidative stress levels, alterations in energy status, DNA and protein damage, and they all have a common transcriptional target, the FoxO family of Forkhead transcription factors. Oxidative stress promotes both the transcriptional activity and protein stability of FoxOs. In turn, activated FoxOs promote antioxidant defense by controlling the expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response, DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Among the FoxO isoforms, FoxO1 in osteoblasts uses a previously unrecognized mechanism to preserve redox balance by promoting protein synthesis and subsequently inhibiting cell cycle arrest.

        "Abstract": "Osteoporosis, a disease of low bone mass, is associated with decreased osteoblast numbers and increased levels of oxidative stress within osteoblasts. Since transcription factors of the FoxO family confer stress resistance, we investigated their potential impact on skeletal integrity. Here we employ cell-specific deletion and molecular analyses to show that, among the three FoxO proteins, only FoxO1 is required for proliferation and redox balance in osteoblasts and thereby controls bone formation. FoxO1 regulation of osteoblast proliferation occurs through its interaction with ATF4, a transcription factor regulating amino acid import, as well as through its regulation of a stress-dependent pathway influencing p53 signaling. Accordingly, decreasing oxidative stress levels or increasing protein intake normalizes bone formation and bone mass in mice lacking FoxO1 specifically in osteoblasts. These results identify FoxO1 as a crucial regulator of osteoblast physiology and provide a direct mechanistic link between oxidative stress and the regulation of bone remodeling.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoblasts have recently been found to play a role in regulating glucose metabolism through secretion of osteocalcin. It is unknown, however, how this osteoblast function is regulated transcriptionally. As FoxO1 is a forkhead family transcription factor known to regulate several key aspects of glucose homeostasis, we investigated whether its expression in osteoblasts may contribute to its metabolic functions. Here we show that mice lacking Foxo1 only in osteoblasts had increased pancreatic beta cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. The ability of osteoblast-specific FoxO1 deficiency to affect metabolic homeostasis was due to increased osteocalcin expression and decreased expression of Esp, a gene that encodes a protein responsible for decreasing the bioactivity of osteocalcin. These results indicate that FoxO1 expression in osteoblasts contributes to FoxO1 control of glucose homeostasis and identify FoxO1 as a key modulator of the ability of the skeleton to function as an endocrine organ regulating glucose metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Continuous exposure to parathyroid hormone (PTH) is associated with catabolic effects, whereas intermittent exposure to low doses of PTH is associated with anabolic effects. By controlling osteoblast function, PTH increases bone formation on cancellous, endocortical, and periosteal bone surfaces. In general, PTH does not affect the replication of uncommitted osteoblast progenitors but suppresses proliferation of committed osteoprogenitors. Intermittent PTH promotes osteoblast differentiation, in part, by its ability to promote exit from the cell cycle, to activate Wnt signaling in osteoblasts, and to inhibit the Wnt antagonist sclerostin in osteocytes. Insulin-like growth factor-1 is also required for the actions of PTH to increase osteoblast numbers. Intermittent PTH prolongs osteoblast survival in rodents by mechanisms that involve activation and proteolytic degradation of Runx2. PTH's ability to orchestrate a dynamic range of signaling cascades that determine osteoblast fate may explain both its catabolic and beneficial actions on the skeleton.",

        "Title": "Differentiation and proliferation of periosteal osteoblast progenitors are differentially regulated by estrogens and intermittent parathyroid hormone administration.",
        "Abstract": "The periosteum is now widely recognized as a homeostatic and therapeutic target for actions of sex steroids and intermittent PTH administration. The mechanisms by which estrogens suppress but PTH promotes periosteal expansion are not known. In this report, we show that intermittent PTH(1-34) promotes differentiation of periosteal osteoblast precursors as evidenced by the stimulation of the expression or activity of alkaline phosphatase as well as of targets of the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and Wnt pathways. In contrast, 17beta-estradiol (E2) had no effect by itself. However, it attenuated PTH- or BMP-2-induced differentiation of primary periosteal osteoblast progenitors. Administration of intermittent PTH to ovariectomized mice induced rapid phosphorylation of the BMP-2 target Smad1/5/8 in the periosteum. A replacement dose of E2 had no effect by itself but suppressed PTH-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. In contrast to its effects to stimulate periosteal osteoblast differentiation, PTH promoted and subsequently suppressed proliferation of periosteal osteoblast progenitors in vitro and in vivo. E2 promoted proliferation and attenuated the antiproliferative effect of PTH. Both hormones protected periosteal osteoblasts from apoptosis induced by various proapoptotic agents. These observations suggest that the different effects of PTH and estrogens on the periosteum result from opposing actions on the recruitment of early periosteal osteoblast progenitors. Intermittent PTH promotes osteoblast differentiation from periosteum-derived mesenchymal progenitors through ERK-, BMP-, and Wnt-dependent signaling pathways. Estrogens promote proliferation of early osteoblast progenitors but inhibit their differentiation by osteogenic agents such as PTH or BMP-2.",

        "Abstract": "Estrogens control gene transcription by cis or trans interactions of the estrogen receptor (ER) with target DNA or via the activation of cytoplasmic kinases. We report that selective activation of kinase-mediated actions of the ER with 4-estren-3alpha,17beta-diol (estren) or an estradiol-dendrimer conjugate, each a synthetic compound that stimulates kinase-mediated ER actions 1,000 to 10,000 times more potently than direct DNA interactions, induced osteoblastic differentiation in established cell lines of uncommitted osteoblast precursors and primary cultures of osteoblast progenitors by stimulating Wnt and BMP-2 signaling in a kinase-dependent manner. In sharp contrast, 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) suppressed BMP-2-induced osteoblast progenitor commitment and differentiation. Consistent with the in vitro findings, estren, but not E(2), stimulated Wnt/beta-catenin-mediated transcription in T-cell factor-lacZ transgenic mice. Moreover, E(2) stimulated BMP signaling in mice in which ERalpha lacks DNA binding activity and classical estrogen response element-mediated transcription (ERalpha(NERKI/-)) but not in wild-type controls. This evidence reveals for the first time the existence of a large signalosome in which inputs from the ER, kinases, bone morphogenetic proteins, and Wnt signaling converge to induce differentiation of osteoblast precursors. ER can either induce it or repress it, depending on whether the activating ligand (and presumably the resulting conformation of the receptor protein) precludes or accommodates ERE-mediated transcription.",

        "Abstract": "Genetic studies in humans and mice have revealed an important role of the Wnt signaling pathway in the regulation of bone mass, resulting from potent effects on the control of osteoblast progenitor proliferation, commitment, differentiation, and perhaps osteoblast apoptosis. To establish the linkage between Wnts and osteoblast survival and to elucidate the molecular pathways that link the two, we have utilized three cell models: the uncommitted bipotential C2C12 cells, the pre-osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, and bone marrow-derived OB-6 osteoblasts. Serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis was prevented by the canonical Wnts (Wnt3a and Wnt1) and the noncanonical Wnt5a in all cell types. Wnt3a induced LRP5-independent transient phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of ERKs and phosphorylation of Src and Akt. The anti-apoptotic effect of Wnt3a was abrogated by inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, as well as by inhibitors of MEK, Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), or Akt kinases, or by the addition of cycloheximide to the culture medium. Wnt3a-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and downstream activation of beta-catenin-mediated transcription required ERK, PI3K, and Akt signaling. Wnt3a increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in an ERK-dependent manner. Beta-catenin-mediated transcription was permissive for the anti-apoptotic actions of Wnt1 and Wnt3a but was dispensable for the anti-apoptotic action of Wnt5a. However, Src, ERKs, PI3K, and Akt kinases were required for the anti-apoptotic effects of Wnt5a. These results demonstrate for the first time that Wnt proteins, irrespective of their ability to stimulate canonical Wnt signaling, prolong the survival of osteoblasts and uncommitted osteoblast progenitors via activation of the Src/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades.",

        "Title": "Bisphosphonates and estrogens inhibit osteocyte apoptosis via distinct molecular mechanisms downstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation.",
        "Abstract": "Both estrogens and bisphosphonates attenuate osteocyte apoptosis by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). However, whereas estrogens activate ERKs via an extranuclear function of the estrogen receptor, bisphosphonates do so by opening connexin 43 hemichannels. Here, we demonstrated that the signaling events downstream of ERKs induced by these two stimuli are also distinct. Inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis by estrogens requires nuclear accumulation of ERKs and activation of downstream transcription factors. On the other hand, anti-apoptosis induced by bisphosphonates requires neither transcription nor ERK-dependent transcription factors. Instead, the effect of bisphosphonates is abolished when ERKs are restricted to the nucleus by blocking CRM1/exportin1-mediated nuclear protein export or by expressing nuclear-anchored ERKs, but it is unaffected in cells expressing cytoplasmic-anchored ERKs. Connexin 43/ERK-mediated anti-apoptosis induced by bisphosphonates requires the kinase activity of the cytoplasmic target of ERKs, p90(RSK), which in turn phosphorylates the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and C/EBPbeta. Phosphorylation of BAD renders it inactive, whereas phosphorylation of C/EBPbeta leads to binding of pro-caspases, thus inhibiting apoptosis independently of the transcriptional activity of this transcription factor. Consistent with the evidence that estrogens and bisphosphonates phosphorylate diverse targets of ERKs, probably resulting from activation of spatially distinct pools of these kinases, the two agents had additive effects on osteocyte survival.",

        "Abstract": "Studies in bone, as well as other nonreproductive target tissues of sex steroid, like the cardiovascular and the central nervous system (CNS), have elucidated a previously unappreciated mechanism of sex steroid action involving the rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and/or phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase, and consequent potent regulatory affects on the transcription of a set of genes that is distinct from that regulated through classic (genotropic) control of transcription. These actions stem from an unexpected function of the classic nuclear receptors outside the nucleus, most probably from receptor interactions within distinct signal transduction pathways in preassembled scaffolds. Importantly, these nongenotropic actions are mediated by the ligand-binding domain of the receptor and can be functionally dissociated from classic transcriptional activation with synthetic ligands, termed activators of nongenotropic estrogen-like signaling (ANGELS). We highlight this evidence and discuss its pharmacotherapeutic implications vis a vis the dilemmas posed by the recently appreciated shortfalls of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent cytokine exerting critical functions in the activation and regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. Due to its pleiotropic activities, the amplitude and duration of TNF function must be tightly regulated. One of the mechanisms that may have evolved to modulate TNF function is the proteolytic cleavage of its cell surface receptors. In humans, mutations affecting shedding of the p55TNF receptor (R) have been linked with the development of the TNFR-associated periodic syndromes, disorders characterized by recurrent fever attacks and localized inflammation. Here we show that knock-in mice expressing a mutated nonsheddable p55TNFR develop Toll-like receptor-dependent innate immune hyperreactivity, which renders their immune system more efficient at controlling intracellular bacterial infections. Notably, gain of function for antibacterial host defenses ensues at the cost of disbalanced inflammatory reactions that lead to pathology. Mutant mice exhibit spontaneous hepatitis, enhanced susceptibility to endotoxic shock, exacerbated TNF-dependent arthritis, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These results introduce a new concept for receptor shedding as a mechanism setting up thresholds of cytokine function to balance resistance and susceptibility to disease. Assessment of p55TNFR shedding may thus be of prognostic value in infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases.",

        "Title": "Kinase-mediated regulation of common transcription factors accounts for the bone-protective effects of sex steroids.",
        "Abstract": "It has been found that 4-estren-3alpha,17beta-diol, a synthetic ligand for the estrogen receptor (ER) or androgen receptor (AR), which does not affect classical transcription, reverses bone loss in ovariectomized females or orchidectomized males without affecting the uterus or seminal vesicles, demonstrating that the classical genotropic actions of sex steroid receptors are dispensable for their bone-protective effects, but indispensable for their effects on reproductive organs. We have now investigated the mechanism of action of this compound. We report that, identically to 17beta-estradiol or dihydrotestosterone, but differently from raloxifene, estren alters the activity of Elk-1, CCAAT enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBPbeta), and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein (CREB), or c-Jun/c-Fos by an extranuclear action of the ER or AR, resulting in activation of the Src/Shc/ERK pathway or downregulation of JNK, respectively. All of these effects are non-sex specific, require only the ligand-binding domain of the receptor, and are indispensable for the antiapoptotic action of these ligands on osteoblastic and HeLa cells. Moreover, administration of 17beta-estradiol or 4-estren-3alpha,17beta-diol to ovariectomized mice induces phosphorylation of ERKs, Elk-1, and C/EBPbeta, downregulates c-Jun, and upregulates the expression of egr-1, an ERK/SRE target gene. Kinase-initiated regulation of commonly used transcription factors offers a molecular explanation for the profound skeletal effects of sex steroid receptor ligands, including synthetic ones that are devoid of classical transcriptional activity.",
