        "Abstract": "Although rare diseases individually have a low prevalence, they collectively affect nearly 400 million individuals around the world. On average, it takes five years for an accurate rare disease diagnosis, but many patients remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. As machine learning technologies have been used to aid diagnostics in the past, this study aims to test ChatGPT's suitability for rare disease diagnostic support with the enhancement provided by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RareDxGPT, our enhanced ChatGPT model, supplies ChatGPT with information about 717 rare diseases from an external knowledge resource, the RareDis Corpus, through RAG. In RareDxGPT, when a query is entered, the three documents most relevant to the query in the RareDis Corpus are retrieved. Along with the query, they are returned to ChatGPT to provide a diagnosis. Additionally, phenotypes for thirty different diseases were extracted from free text from PubMed's Case Reports. They were each entered with three different prompt types: \"prompt\", \"prompt + explanation\" and \"prompt + role play.\" The accuracy of ChatGPT and RareDxGPT with each prompt was then measured. With \"Prompt\", RareDxGPT had a 40 % accuracy, while ChatGPT 3.5 got 37 % of the cases correct. With \"Prompt + Explanation\", RareDxGPT had a 43 % accuracy, while ChatGPT 3.5 got 23 % of the cases correct. With \"Prompt + Role Play\", RareDxGPT had a 40 % accuracy, while ChatGPT 3.5 got 23 % of the cases correct. To conclude, ChatGPT, especially when supplying extra domain specific knowledge, demonstrates early potential for rare disease diagnosis with adjustments.",

        "Abstract": "Topic modeling performs poorly on short phrases or sentences and ever-changing slang, which are common in social media, such as X, formerly known as Twitter. This study investigates whether concept annotation tools such as MetaMap can enable topic modeling at the semantic level. Using tweets mentioning \"hydroxychloroquine\" for a case study, we extracted 56,017 posted between 03/01/2020-12/31/2021. The tweets were run through MetaMap to encode concepts with UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) and then we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the optimal model for two datasets: 1) tweets with the original text and 2) tweets with the replaced CUIs. We found that the MetaMap LDA models outperformed the non-MetaMap models in terms of coherence and representativeness and identified topics timely relevant to social and political discussions. We concluded that integrating MetaMap to standardize tweets through UMLS concepts improved semantic topic modeling performance amidst noise in the text.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical notes are full of ambiguous medical abbreviations. Contextual knowledge has been leveraged by recent learning-based approaches for sense disambiguation. Previous findings indicated that structural elements of clinical notes entail useful characteristics for informing different interpretations of abbreviations, yet they have remained underutilized and have not been fully investigated. To our best knowledge, the only study exploring note structures simply enumerated the headers in the notes, where such representations are not semantically meaningful. This paper describes a learning-based approach using the note structure represented by the semantic types predefined in Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). We evaluated the representation in addition to the widely used N-gram with three learning models on two different datasets. Experiments indicate that our feature augmentation consistently improved model performance for abbreviation disambiguation, with the optimal F1 score of 0.93.",

        "Abstract": "Participant recruitment continues to be a challenge to the success of randomized controlled trials, resulting in increased costs, extended trial timelines and delayed treatment availability. Literature provides evidence that study design features (e.g., trial phase, study site involvement) and trial sponsor are significantly associated with recruitment success. Principal investigators oversee the conduct of clinical trials, including recruitment. Through a cross-sectional survey and a thematic analysis of free-text responses, we assessed the perceptions of sixteen principal investigators regarding success factors for participant recruitment. Study site involvement and funding source do not necessarily make recruitment easier or more challenging from the perspective of the principal investigators. The most commonly used recruitment strategies are also the most effort inefficient (e.g., in-person recruitment, reviewing the electronic medical records for prescreening). Finally, we recommended actionable steps, such as improving staff support and leveraging informatics-driven approaches, to allow clinical researchers to enhance participant recruitment.",

        "Abstract": "Real-world clinical practice commonly veers from formal drug approvals in off-label use, accounting for 21% of prescriptions for common drugs. Due to its ad hoc nature, off-label use typically goes undocumented, evading the safety and efficacy scrutiny of clinical trials. A systematic and automated approach to detection of these uses in the electronic health record (EHR) would enable improved safety monitoring, provide insight into prescribing patterns, and support real-world evidence appraisal. Domain knowledge provided by medication-indication knowledge bases has been shown to improve the accuracy of EHR-based automated detection of off-label use, but remains limited due to diverse concept representations and granularities across data sources. We present a method to leverage hierarchical concept knowledge to align medication-indication knowledge with EHR data for automated detection of off-label drug use in clinical practice. We demonstrate an over two-fold increase in detected off-label diagnoses when leveraging hierarchical knowledge relative to direct concept matching alone.",

This study aims to explore the role of ChatGPT in synthesizing medication literature and compare it with a hybrid summarization system. We tested ten medications' effectiveness with reference to their definitions and descriptions extracted from DrugBank. ChatGPT could generate coherent summaries that are not backed by evidence. In contrast, our approach can provide a highly structured and concise synthesis of related evidence, but the resulting summary is not as fluent and convincing as ChatGPT. Therefore, we recommend integrating both techniques to achieve the best performance.",

        "Abstract": "With the burgeoning development of computational phenotypes, it is increasingly difficult to identify the right phenotype for the right tasks. This study uses a mixed-methods approach to develop and evaluate a novel metadata framework for retrieval of and reusing computational phenotypes. Twenty active phenotyping researchers from 2 large research networks, Electronic Medical Records and Genomics and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, were recruited to suggest metadata elements. Once consensus was reached on 39 metadata elements, 47 new researchers were surveyed to evaluate the utility of the metadata framework. The survey consisted of 5-Likert multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. Two more researchers were asked to use the metadata framework to annotate 8 type-2 diabetes mellitus phenotypes. More than 90% of the survey respondents rated metadata elements regarding phenotype definition and validation methods and metrics positively with a score of 4 or 5. Both researchers completed annotation of each phenotype within 60 min. Our thematic analysis of the narrative feedback indicates that the metadata framework was effective in capturing rich and explicit descriptions and enabling the search for phenotypes, compliance with data standards, and comprehensive validation metrics. Current limitations were its complexity for data collection and the entailed human costs.",

        "Abstract": "Although individually rare, collectively more than 7,000 rare diseases affect about 10% of patients. Each of the rare diseases impacts the quality of life for patients and their families, and incurs significant societal costs. The low prevalence of each rare disease causes formidable challenges in accurately diagnosing and caring for these patients and engaging participants in research to advance treatments. Deep learning has advanced many scientific fields and has been applied to many healthcare tasks. This study reviewed the current uses of deep learning to advance rare disease research. Among the 332 reviewed articles, we found that deep learning has been actively used for rare neoplastic diseases (250/332), followed by rare genetic diseases (170/332) and rare neurological diseases (127/332). Convolutional neural networks (307/332) were the most frequently used deep learning architecture, presumably because image data were the most commonly available data type in rare disease research. Diagnosis is the main focus of rare disease research using deep learning (263/332). We summarized the challenges and future research directions for leveraging deep learning to advance rare disease research.",

        "Abstract": "Diagnosis for rare genetic diseases often relies on phenotype-driven methods, which hinge on the accuracy and completeness of the rare disease phenotypes in the underlying annotation knowledgebase. Existing knowledgebases are often manually curated with additional annotations found in published case reports. Despite their potential, real-world data such as electronic health records (EHRs) have not been fully exploited to derive rare disease annotations. Here, we present open annotation for rare diseases (OARD), a real-world-data-derived resource with annotation for rare-disease-related phenotypes. This resource is derived from the EHRs of two academic health institutions containing more than 10 million individuals spanning wide age ranges and different disease subgroups. By leveraging ontology mapping and advanced natural-language-processing (NLP) methods, OARD automatically and efficiently extracts concepts for both rare diseases and their phenotypic traits from billing codes and lab tests as well as over 100 million clinical narratives. The rare disease prevalence derived by OARD is highly correlated with those annotated in the original rare disease knowledgebase. By performing association analysis, we identified more than 1 million novel disease-phenotype association pairs that were previously missed by human annotation, and >60% were confirmed true associations via manual review of a list of sampled pairs. Compared to the manual curated annotation, OARD is 100% data driven and its pipeline can be shared across different institutions. By supporting privacy-preserving sharing of aggregated summary statistics, such as term frequencies and disease-phenotype associations, it fills an important gap to facilitate data-driven research in the rare disease community.",

In this paper, we designed a total sample size extractor using a combination of syntactic and machine learning methods, and evaluated it on 300 Covid-19 abstracts (Covid-Set) and 100 generic RCT abstracts (General-Set). To improve the performance, we applied transfer learning from a large public corpus of annotated abstracts. We achieved an average F1 score of 0.73 on the Covid-Set testing set, and 0.60 on the General-Set using exact matches. The F1 scores for loose matches on both datasets were over 0.74. Compared with the state-of-the-art tool, our extractor reports total sample sizes directly and improved F1 scores by at least 4% without transfer learning. We demonstrated that transfer learning improved the sample size extraction accuracy and minimized human labor on annotations.",

In this study, we manually annotated and analyzed 3,447 intervention snippets from 261 randomized clinical trial (RCT) abstracts and developed a compositional representation for complex interventions, which captures the spatial, temporal and Boolean relations between intervention components, along with an intervention normalization pipeline that automates three tasks: (i) treatment entity extraction; (ii) intervention component relation extraction; and (iii) attribute extraction and association. 361 intervention snippets from 29 unseen abstracts were included to report on the performance of the evaluation. The average F-measure was 0.74 for treatment entity extraction on an exact match and 0.82 for attribute extraction. The F-measure for relation extraction of multi-component complex interventions was 0.90. 93% of extracted attributes were correctly attributed to corresponding treatment entities.",

It enables user configuration of 13 clinical trial features and 4 metrics (Jaccard similarity, semantic-based similarity, temporal overlap and geographical distance) to measure pairwise trial similarities. Among 1,007 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) trials conducted in the United States, 91.9% were found to have similar trials with the similarity threshold being 0.85 and 43.8% were highly similar with the threshold 0.95.

        "Abstract": "While the PICO framework is widely used by clinicians for clinical question formulation when querying the medical literature, it does not have the expressiveness to explicitly capture medical findings based on any standard. In addition, findings extracted from the literature are represented as free-text, which is not amenable to computation. This research extends the PICO framework with Observation elements, which capture the observed effect that an Intervention has on an Outcome, forming Intervention-Observation-Outcome triplets. In addition, we present a framework to normalize Observation elements with respect to their significance and the direction of the effect, as well as a rule-based approach to perform the normalization of these attributes. Our method achieves macro-averaged F1 scores of 0.82 and 0.73 for identifying the significance and direction attributes, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of delirium in electronic health records (EHRs) remains difficult due to inadequate assessment or under-documentation. The purpose of this research is to present a classification model that identifies delirium using retrospective EHR data. Delirium was confirmed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Age, sex, Elixhauser comorbidity index, drug exposures, and diagnoses were used as features. The model was developed based on the Columbia University Irving Medical Center EHR data and further validated with the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset. Seventy-six patients from Surgical/Cardiothoracic ICU were included in the model. The logistic regression model achieved the best performance in identifying delirium; mean AUC of 0.874 ± 0.033. The mean positive predictive value of the logistic regression model was 0.80. The model promises to identify delirium cases with EHR data, thereby enable a sustainable infrastructure to build a retrospective cohort of delirium.",

        "Title": "Characterization and Function of the Interaction of Angiogenin With Alpha-Actinin 2.",
        "Abstract": "Angiogenin (ANG) is the first human tumor-derived angiogenic protein, which can promote angiogenesis and tumor growth. In a previous study, we identified alpha-actinin 2 (ACTN2), a cytoskeletal protein, as a direct interacting protein with angiogenin. However, the interaction between ANG and ACTN2 was not characterized in detail, which may provide information on the molecular mechanisms of ANG functions. In this study, we mapped the accurate binding domain and sites in ANG and ACTN2, respectively. In ANG, the residues from 83 to 105 are the smallest motif that can bind to ACTN2. We then use site mutation analysis to identify the precise binding sites of ANG in the interaction and found that the 101st residue arginine (R101) represents the critical residue involved in the ANG-ACTN2 interaction. In ACTN2, the residues from 383 to 632, containing two spectrin domains in the middle of the rod structure of ACTN2, play an important role in the interaction. Furthermore, we validated the interaction of ACTN2-383-632 to ANG by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay. In functional analysis, overexpressed ACTN2-383-632 could impair tumor cell motility observably, including cell migration and invasion. Meanwhile, ACTN2-383-632 overexpression inhibited tumor cell proliferation and survival as well. These data suggest that an excess expression of ACTN2 segment ACTN2-383-632 can inhibit tumor cell motility and proliferation by interfering with the interaction between ANG and ACTN2, which provides a potential mechanism of ANG action in tumor growth and metastasis.",

        "Abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a defining feature of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the leading causes of disability and mortality in the elderly population. Assessing cognitive impairment is important for diagnostic, clinical management, and research purposes. The Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most common screening measure of cognitive function, yet this score is not consistently available in the electronic health records. We conducted a pilot study to extract frequently used concepts characterizing cognitive function from the clinical notes of AD patients in an Aging and Dementia clinical practice. Then we developed a model to infer the severity of cognitive impairment and created a subspecialized taxonomy for concepts associated with MMSE scores. We evaluated the taxonomy and the severity prediction model and presented example use cases of this model.",

        "Abstract": "Mature microRNA (miRNA) decay is a key step in miRNA turnover and gene expression regulation. Angiogenin (ANG), the first human tumor-derived angiogenic protein and also a member of the RNase A superfamily, can promote tumor growth and metastasis by regulating rRNA biogenesis and tiRNA production. However, its effect on miRNA has not been explored. In this study, we find that ANG exclusively downregulates mature miR-141 in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) via its ribonuclease activity and preferably cleaves single-stranded miR-141 at the A",

The goals of this study are to quantify and qualify the disagreement between human and NLP. We developed an NLP system for annotating clinical trial eligibility criteria text and constructed a manually annotated corpus, both following the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). We analyzed the discrepancies between the human and NLP annotations and their causes (e.g., ambiguities in concept categorization and tacit decisions on inclusion of qualifiers and temporal attributes during concept annotation). This study initially reported complexities in clinical trial eligibility criteria text that complicate NLP and the limitations of the OMOP CDM. The disagreement between and human and NLP annotations may be generalizable. We discuss implications for NLP evaluation.",

In this paper, we propose a model to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-19 will develop severe outcomes based only on the patient's historical electronic health records (EHR) prior to hospital admission using recurrent neural networks. The model predicts risk score that represents the probability for a patient to progress into severe status (mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, or death) after being infected with COVID-19. The model achieved 0.846 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting patients' outcomes averaged over 5-fold cross validation. While many of the existing models use features obtained after diagnosis of COVID-19, our proposed model only utilizes a patient's historical EHR to enable proactive risk management at the time of hospital admission.",

The quality of evidence is organized in a hierarchy in which randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as least biased. However, RCTs are plagued by poor generalizability, impeding the translation of clinical research to practice. Though the presence of poor external validity is known, the factors that contribute to poor generalizability have not been summarized and placed in a framework. We propose a new population-oriented conceptual framework to facilitate consistent and comprehensive evaluation of generalizability, replicability, and assessment of RCT study quality.",

        "Abstract": "2,719 distinctive phenotyping variables from 176 electronic phenotypes were compared with 57,150 distinctive clinical trial eligibility criteria concepts to assess the phenotype knowledge overlap between them. We observed a high percentage (69.5%) of eMERGE phenotype features and a lower percentage (47.6%) of OHDSI phenotype features matched to clinical trial eligibility criteria, possibly due to the relative emphasis on specificity for eMERGE phenotypes and the relative emphasis on sensitivity for OHDSI phenotypes. The study results show the potential of reusing clinical trial eligibility criteria for phenotyping feature selection and moderate benefits of using them for local cohort query implementation.",

        "Abstract": "Rapidly increasing costs have been a major threat to our clinical research enterprise. Improvement in appointment scheduling is a crucial means to boost efficiency and save cost in clinical research and has been well studied in the outpatient setting. This study reviews nearly 5 years of usage data of an integrated scheduling system implemented at Columbia University/New York Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP) called IMPACT and provides original insights into the challenges faced by a clinical research facility. Briefly, the IMPACT data shows that high rates of room and resource changes correlate with rescheduled appointments and that rescheduled visits are more likely to be attended than non-rescheduled visits. We highlight the differing roles of schedulers, coordinators, and investigators, and propose a highly accurate predictive model of participant no-shows in a research setting. This study sheds light on ways to reduce overall cost and improve the care we offer to clinical research participants.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trials are essential for generating reliable medical evidence, but often suffer from expensive and delayed patient recruitment because the unstructured eligibility criteria description prevents automatic query generation for eligibility screening. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many trials have been created but their information is not computable. We included 700 COVID-19 trials available at the point of study and developed a semi-automatic approach to generate an annotated corpus for COVID-19 clinical trial eligibility criteria called COVIC. A hierarchical annotation schema based on the OMOP Common Data Model was developed to accommodate four levels of annotation granularity: i.e., study cohort, eligibility criteria, named entity and standard concept. In COVIC, 39 trials with more than one study cohorts were identified and labelled with an identifier for each cohort. 1,943 criteria for non-clinical characteristics such as \"informed consent\", \"exclusivity of participation\" were annotated. 9767 criteria were represented by 18,161 entities in 8 domains, 7,743 attributes of 7 attribute types and 16,443 relationships of 11 relationship types. 17,171 entities were mapped to standard medical concepts and 1,009 attributes were normalized into computable representations. COVIC can serve as a corpus indexed by semantic tags for COVID-19 trial search and analytics, and a benchmark for machine learning based criteria extraction.",

        "Abstract": "How clinicians utilize medically actionable genomic information, displayed in the electronic health record (EHR), in medical decision-making remains unknown. Participating sites of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network have invested resources into EHR integration efforts to enable the display of genetic testing data across heterogeneous EHR systems. To assess clinicians' engagement with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants within a large tertiary care academic medical center, we analyzed automatically generated EHR access log data. We found that clinicians viewed only 1% of all the eMERGE genetic test results integrated in the EHR. Using a cluster analysis, we also identified different user traits associated with varying degrees of engagement with the EHR-integrated genomic data. These data contribute important empirical knowledge about clinicians limited and brief engagements with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants. Appreciation for user-specific roles provide additional context for why certain users were more or less engaged with the unsolicited results. This study highlights opportunities to use EHR log data as a performance metric to more precisely inform ongoing EHR-integration efforts and decisions about the allocation of informatics resources in genomic research.",

        "Title": "Caspase 3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis contributes to chemotherapy drug-induced nephrotoxicity.",
        "Abstract": "Chemotherapy drug-induced nephrotoxicity limits clinical applications for treating cancers. Pyroptosis, a newly discovered programmed cell death, was recently reported to be associated with kidney diseases. However, the role of pyroptosis in chemotherapeutic drug-induced nephrotoxicity has not been fully clarified. Herein, we demonstrate that the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin or doxorubicin, induces the cleavage of gasdermin E (GSDME) in cultured human renal tubular epithelial cells, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Morphologically, cisplatin- or doxorubicin-treated renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit large bubbles emerging from the cell membrane. Furthermore, activation of caspase 3, not caspase 9, is associated with GSDME cleavage in cisplatin- or doxorubicin-treated renal tubular epithelial cells. Meanwhile, silencing GSDME alleviates cisplatin- or doxorubicin-induced HK-2 cell pyroptosis by increasing cell viability and decreasing LDH release. In addition, treatment with Ac-DMLD-CMK, a polypeptide targeting mouse caspase 3-Gsdme signaling, inhibits caspase 3 and Gsdme activation, alleviates the deterioration of kidney function, attenuates renal tubular epithelial cell injury, and reduces inflammatory cytokine secretion in vivo. Specifically, GSDME cleavage depends on ERK and JNK signaling. NAC, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor, reduces GSDME cleavage through JNK signaling in human renal tubular epithelial cells. Thus, we speculate that renal tubular epithelial cell pyroptosis induced by chemotherapy drugs is mediated by ROS-JNK-caspase 3-GSDME signaling, implying that therapies targeting GSDME may prove efficacious in overcoming chemotherapeutic drug-induced nephrotoxicity.",

        "Abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened the health of tens of millions of people worldwide and imposed heavy burden on global healthcare systems. In this paper, we propose a model to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-19 will develop severe outcomes based only on the patient's historical electronic health records (EHR) prior to hospital admission using recurrent neural networks. The model predicts risk score that represents the probability for a patient to progress into severe status (mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, or death) after being infected with COVID-19. The model achieved 0.846 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting patients' outcomes averaged over 5-fold cross validation. While many of the existing models use features obtained after diagnosis of COVID-19, our proposed model only utilizes a patient's historical EHR to enable proactive risk management at the time of hospital admission.",

To facilitate recruitment, tools for patient search of relevant clinical trials have been developed, but users often suffer from information overload. With nearly 700 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) trials conducted in the United States as of August 2020, it is imperative to enable rapid recruitment to these studies. The COVID-19 Trial Finder was designed to facilitate patient-centered search of COVID-19 trials, first by location and radius distance from trial sites, and then by brief, dynamically generated medical questions to allow users to prescreen their eligibility for nearby COVID-19 trials with minimum human computer interaction. A simulation study using 20 publicly available patient case reports demonstrates its precision and effectiveness.",

        "Abstract": "We performed a trends analysis of experimental cancer interventions. The complete records of 32,623 interventional neoplasm clinical trials involving 454 types of neoplasms from 2000 to 2017 were downloaded from the AACT database. The conditions and drug concepts were normalized using MetaMap. The normalized frequencies (NF) for each type of intervention were calculated and compared. Among 95,440 interventions, 77.4% were drugs, 5.3% were radiation, 6.6% were surgery and 10.6% were other therapies. Among 47,754 arms, 82.8% were mono-type interventions and 17.2% were multi-type interventions. Among 73,889 drug interventions, immunologic factor drugs increased rapidly over the last five years. Both breast cancer and pancreatic cancer have been testing new drugs in clinical trials; however, more drugs have been tested in phase 3 or 4 trials and employed in comparator arms for breast cancer compared to pancreatic cancer. Breast cancer trials showed a more even drug NF distribution than pancreatic cancer trials. The JS Distance among three periods (2000-05 vs. 2006-11 vs. 2012-17) showed unidirectional research progress trend for breast cancer, but reverse trend for pancreatic cancer. This study contributes a large-scale landscape overview of the trends in cancer experimental interventions and a methodology for using public clinical trial summaries for understanding the evolving cancer research.",

        "Abstract": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as the most reputable source of evidence. In some studies, factors beyond the intervention itself may contribute to the measured effect, an occurrence known as heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). If the RCT population differs from the real-world population on factors that induce HTE, the trials effect will not replicate. The RCTs eligibility criteria should identify the sub-population in which its evidence will replicate. However, the extent to which the eligibility criteria identify the appropriate population is unknown, which raises concerns for generalizability. We compared reported data from RCTs with real-world data from the electronic health records of a large, academic medical center that was curated according to RCT eligibility criteria. Our results show fundamental differences between the RCT population and our observational cohorts, which suggests that eligibility criteria may be insufficient for identifying the applicable real-world population in which RCT evidence will replicate.",

This study aims to better understand the role of scientific commentary in evidence appraisal. We queried PubMed for all clinical research articles with accompanying comments and extracted corresponding metadata. Five percent of clinical research studies (N = 130 629) received postpublication comments (N = 171 556), resulting in 178 882 comment-article pairings, with 90% published in the same journal. We obtained 5197 full-text comments for topic modeling and exploratory sentiment analysis. Topics were generally disease specific with only a few topics relevant to the appraisal of studies, which were highly prevalent in letters. Of a random sample of 518 full-text comments, 67% had a supportive tone. Based on our results, published commentary, with the exception of letters, most often highlight or endorse previous publications rather than serve as a prominent mechanism for critical appraisal.",

        "Abstract": "Algorithms for identifying patients of interest from observational data must address missing and inaccurate data and are desired to achieve comparable performance on both administrative claims and electronic health records data. However, administrative claims data do not contain the necessary information to develop accurate algorithms for disorders that require laboratory results, and this omission can result in insensitive diagnostic code-based algorithms. In this paper, we tested our assertion that the performance of a diagnosis code-based algorithm for chronic kidney disorder (CKD) can be improved by adding other codes indirectly related to CKD (e.g., codes for dialysis, kidney transplant, suspicious kidney disorders). Following the best practices from Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), we adapted an electronic health record-based gold standard algorithm for CKD and then created algorithms that can be executed on administrative claims data and account for related data quality issues. We externally validated our algorithms on four electronic health record datasets in the OHDSI network. Compared to the algorithm that uses CKD diagnostic codes only, positive predictive value of the algorithms that use additional codes was slightly increased (47.4% vs. 47.9-48.5% respectively). The algorithms adapted from the gold standard algorithm can be used to infer chronic kidney disorder based on administrative claims data. We succeeded in improving the generalizability and consistency of the CKD phenotypes by using data and vocabulary standardized across the OHDSI network, although performance variability across datasets remains. We showed that identifying and addressing coding and data heterogeneity can improve the performance of the algorithms.",

In this paper, we evaluate the use of genomic test reports ordered for cancer patients in order to derive cancer subtypes and to identify biological pathways predictive of poor survival outcomes. A novel method is proposed to calculate patient similarity based on affected biological pathways rather than gene mutations. We demonstrate that this approach identifies subtypes of prognostic value and biological pathways linked to survival, with implications for precision treatment selection and a better understanding of the underlying disease. We also share lessons learned regarding the opportunities and challenges of secondary use of observational genomic data to conduct such research.",

Mediated query is commonly adopted to facilitate data access for investigators. However, the query mediation process remains a black-box. This study analyzed the email-based dialogues between investigators and clinical data query mediators from three institutions. We identify discussion topics and their frequencies, model task flows, and analyze user needs for query mediation support revealed from the dialogues. While the datasets between different institutions are distinct in some notable respects, we find that together they provide common insights for streamlining data access. From our findings, we conclude an intelligent dialogue-based query support model is feasible to automate human-mediated clinical data access for investigators and stakeholders.",

        "Abstract": "This study used Amazon Mechanical Turk to crowdsource public opinions about sharing medical records for clinical research. The 1,508 valid respondents comprised 58.7% males, 54% without college degrees, 41.5% students or unemployed, and 84.3% under 40 years old. More than 74% were somewhat willing to share de-identified records. Education level, employment status, and gender were identified as significant predictors of willingness to share one's own or one's family's medical records (partially identifiable, completely identifiable, or de-identified). Thematic analysis applied to respondent comments uncovered barriers to sharing, including the inability to track uses and users of their information, potential harm (such as identity theft or healthcare denial), lack of trust, and worries about information misuse. Our study suggests that implementing reliable medical record de-identification and emphasizing trust development are essential to addressing such concerns. Amazon Mechanical Turk proved cost-effective for collecting public opinions with short surveys.",

SNOMEDtxt converts ontological concept definitions and relations contained in SNOMED CT into narrative disease descriptions using Natural Language Generation techniques. Generated text is evaluated using both computational methods and clinician and lay user feedback. User evaluations indicate that lay people prefer generated text to the original SNOMED content, find it more informative, and understand it significantly better. This method promises to improve access to clinical knowledge for patients and the medical community and to assist in ontology auditing through natural language descriptions.",

In this research, we proposed a data driven method, that is, integrating a variety of publicly available data resources including Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and cui2vec concept embedding to construct a mental disease similarity network. The resulting mental disease similarity network offered a new view for navigating and investigating disease relations; it also revealed popular mental disease in the literature in terms of the number of connections and similarities with other diseases. It shows that depressive disorder is directly connected with nine other popular diseases and connects 52 other diseases in the network. The top three popular mental diseases are depressive disorder, dysthymia (now known as persistent depressive disorder), and neurosis. Future research will focus on studying the clusters generated from the similarity network.",

        "Abstract": "Secondary analysis of electronic health records for clinical research faces significant challenges due to known data quality issues in health data observationally collected for clinical care and the data biases caused by standard healthcare processes. In this manuscript, we contribute methodology for data quality assessment by plotting domain-level (conditions (diagnoses), drugs, and procedures) aggregate statistics and concept-level temporal frequencies (i.e., annual prevalence rates of clinical concepts). We detect common temporal patterns in concept frequencies by normalizing and clustering annual concept frequencies using K-means clustering. We apply these methods to the Columbia University Irving Medical Center Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership database. The resulting domain-aggregate and cluster plots show a variety of patterns. We review the patterns found in the condition domain and investigate the processes that shape them. We find that these patterns suggest data quality issues influenced by system-wide factors that affect individual concept frequencies.",

        "Abstract": "PICO (Population/problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) is widely adopted for formulating clinical questions to retrieve evidence from the literature. It plays a crucial role in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). This paper contributes a scalable deep learning method to extract PICO statements from RCT articles. It was trained on a small set of richly annotated PubMed abstracts using an LSTM-CRF model. By initializing our model with pretrained parameters from a large related corpus, we improved the model performance significantly with a minimal feature set. Our method has advantages in minimizing the need for laborious feature handcrafting and in avoiding the need for large shared annotated data by reusing related corpora in pretraining with a deep neural network.",

        "Abstract": "This study reports the first assessment of published comments in the family medicine literature using structured codes, which produced commentary annotations that will be the foundation of a knowledge base of appraisals of family medicine trials. Evidence appraisal occurs in a variety of formats and serves to shed light on the quality of research. However, scientific discourse generally and evidence appraisal in particular has not itself been analyzed for insights. A search strategy was devised to identify all journal comments indexed in PubMed linked to controlled intervention studies published in a recent 15-year period in major family medicine journals. A previously developed structured representation in the form of a list of appraisal concepts was used to formally annotate and categorize the journal comments through an iterative process. Trends in family medicine evidence appraisal were then analyzed. A total of 93 comments on studies from five journals over 15 years were included in the analysis. Two thirds of extracted appraisals were negative criticisms. All appraisals of measurement instruments were negative (100%). The participants baseline characteristics, the author discussions, and the design of the interventions were also criticized (respectively 91.7%, 84.6% and 83.3% negative). In contrast, appraisals of the scientific basis of the studies were positive (81.8%). The categories with the most appraisals were, most generally, those focused on the study design, and most specifically, those focused on the scientific basis. This study provides a new data-driven approach to review scientific discourse regarding the strengths and limitations of research within academic family medicine. This methodology can potentially generalize to other medical domains. Structured appraisal data generated here will enable future clinical, scientific, and policy decision-making and broader meta-research in family medicine.",

We carried out a four-phase analysis of clinical case studies to characterize how such processes are represented through relationships between clinical terms. The result is an terminology of 26 relationships that were validated against published clinical cases with 85.4% interrater reliability. We believe that capturing patient-specific information with these relationships can lead to improvements in clinical decision support systems, information retrieval and learning health systems.",

COHD was derived from Columbia University Irving Medical Center's Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) database. The lifetime dataset, derived from all records, contains 36,578 single concepts (11,952 conditions, 12,334 drugs, and 10,816 procedures) and 32,788,901 concept pairs from 5,364,781 patients. The 5-year dataset, derived from records from 2013-2017, contains 29,964 single concepts (10,159 conditions, 10,264 drugs, and 8,270 procedures) and 15,927,195 concept pairs from 1,790,431 patients. Exclusion of rare concepts (count ≤ 10) and Poisson randomization enable data sharing by eliminating risks to patient privacy. EHR prevalences are informative of healthcare consumption rates. Analysis of co-occurrence frequencies via relative frequency analysis and observed-expected frequency ratio are informative of associations between clinical concepts, useful for biomedical research tasks such as drug repurposing and pharmacovigilance. COHD is publicly accessible through a web application-programming interface (API) and downloadable from the Figshare repository. The code is available on GitHub.",

        "Abstract": "The miR-200 family, consisting of miR-200a/b/c, miR-141, and miR-429, is well known to inhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer invasion and metastasis. Among the miR-200 family members, miR-200a/b/c and miR-429 have been reported to inhibit angiogenesis. However, the role of miR-141 in angiogenesis remains elusive, as contradicting results have been found in different cancer types and tumor models. Particularly, the effect of miR-141 in vascular endothelial cells has not been defined. In this study, we used several in vitro and in vivo models to demonstrate that miR-141 in endothelial cells inhibits angiogenesis. Additional mechanistic studies showed that miR-141 suppresses angiogenesis through multiple targets, including NRP1, GAB1, CXCL12β, TGFβ2, and GATA6, and bioinformatics analysis indicated that miR-141 and its targets comprise a powerful and precise regulatory network to modulate angiogenesis. Taken together, these data not only demonstrate an anti-angiogenic effect of miR-141, further strengthening the critical role of miR-200 family in the process of angiogenesis, but also provides a valuable cancer therapeutic target to control both angiogenesis and EMT, two essential steps in tumor growth and metastasis.",

        "Abstract": "Much effort has been devoted to leverage EHR data for matching patients into clinical trials. However, EHRs may not contain all important data elements for clinical research eligibility screening. To better design research-friendly EHRs, an important step is to identify data elements frequently used for eligibility screening but not yet available in EHRs. This study fills this knowledge gap. Using the Alzheimer's disease domain as an example, we performed text mining on the eligibility criteria text in Clinicaltrials.gov to identify frequently used eligibility criteria concepts. We compared them to the EHR data elements of a cohort of Alzheimer's Disease patients to assess the data gap by usingthe OMOP Common Data Model to standardize the representations for both criteria concepts and EHR data elements. We identified the most common SNOMED CT concepts used in Alzheimer 's Disease trials, andfound 40% of common eligibility criteria concepts were not even defined in the concept space in the EHR dataset for a cohort of Alzheimer 'sDisease patients, indicating a significant data gap may impede EHR-based eligibility screening. The results of this study can be useful for designing targeted research data collection forms to help fill the data gap in the EHR.",

In this paper, we described a practical method for transforming free-text clinical research eligibility criteria of Alzheimer's clinical trials into a structured relational database compliant with standards for medical terminologies and clinical data models. We utilized a hybrid natural language processing system and a concept normalization tool to extract medical terms in clinical research eligibility criteria and represent them using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) v5. We created a database schema design to store syntactic relations to facilitate efficient cohort queries. We further discussed the potential of applying this method to trials on other diseases and the promise of using it to accelerate clinical research with electronic health records.",

        "Abstract": "Cohort identification for clinical studies tends to be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Developing automated or semi-automated methods for cohort identification is one of the \"holy grails\" in the field of biomedical informatics. We propose a high-throughput similarity-based cohort identification algorithm by applying numerical abstractions on Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. We implement this algorithm using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), which enables sites using this standardized EHR data representation to avail this algorithm with minimum effort for local implementation. We validate its performance for a retrospective cohort identification task on six clinical trials conducted at the Columbia University Medical Center. Our algorithm achieves an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.966 and an average Precision at 5 of 0.983. This interoperable method promises to achieve efficient cohort identification in EHR databases. We discuss suitable applications of our method and its limitations and propose warranted future work.",

We propose a multi-trait metric - GIST 2.0 that can compute the a priori generalizability based on the population representativeness of a clinical study by explicitly modeling the dependencies among all eligibility criteria. We evaluate this metric on twenty clinical studies of two diseases and analyze how a study's eligibility criteria affect its generalizability (collectively and individually). We statistically analyze the effects of trial setting, trait selection and trait summarizing technique on GIST 2.0. Finally we provide theoretical as well as empirical validations for the expected properties of GIST 2.0.",

To infer such relations, we partition the extracted concepts and group them into closely-related clusters using Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, informed by syntactic matching and semantic relatedness functions. We introduce a novel, unsupervised method for cluster detection based on automated dendrogram pruning, which is dynamic to each partition. We evaluate our approach with two different types of textual corpora, clinical trials descriptions and MEDLINE publication abstracts. The results of several experiments indicate that our method is superior to existing dynamic pruning and the state-of-art taxonomy learning methods. It yields higher concept coverage (95.75%) and higher accuracy of learned taxonomic relations (up to 0.71 average precision and 0.96 average recall).",

        "Abstract": "Randomized controlled trials can benefit from proactive assessment of how well their participant selection strategies during the design of eligibility criteria can influence the study generalizability. In this paper, we present a quantitative metric called generalizability index for study traits 2.0 (GIST 2.0) to assess the a priori generalizability (based on population representativeness) of a clinical trial by accounting for the dependencies among multiple eligibility criteria. The metric was evaluated on 16 sepsis trials identified from ClinicalTrials.gov, with their adverse event reports extracted from the trial results sections. The correlation between GIST scores and adverse events was analyzed. We found that the GIST 2.0 score was significantly correlated with total adverse events and serious adverse events (weighted correlation coefficients of 0.825 and 0.709, respectively, with P < 0.01). This study exemplifies the promising use of Big Data in electronic health records and ClinicalTrials.gov for optimizing eligibility criteria design for clinical studies.",

Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the trends of cancer trial eligibility criteria between 1999 and 2014. The yearly distributions of eligibility concepts for chemicals and drugs, procedures, observations, and medical conditions extracted from free-text eligibility criteria of 32,000 clinical trials for 89 cancer types were analyzed. We identified the concepts that trend upwards or downwards in all or selected cancer types, and the concepts that show anomalous trends for some cancers. Later, concept trends were studied in a disease-specific manner and illustrated for breast cancer. Criteria trends observed in this study are also validated and interpreted using evidence from the existing medical literature. This study contributes a method for concept trend analysis and original knowledge of the trends in cancer clinical trial eligibility criteria.",

However, the interrogation of such Big Data by clinical researchers can be laborious and error-prone, involving iterative and ineffective communication of data requests to data analysts. Research on this communication process is rare. There also exists no contemporary system that offers intelligent solutions to assist clinical researchers in their quest for clinical data. In this article, we first provide a detailed characterization of the challenges encountered in this communication space. Second, we identify promising synergies between fields studying human-to-human and human-machine communication that can shed light on biomedical data query mediation. We propose a mixed-initiative dialog-based approach to support autonomous clinical data access and recommend needed technology development and communication study for accelerating clinical research.",

        "Title": "Facilitating biomedical researchers' interrogation of electronic health record data: Ideas from outside of biomedical informatics.",
        "Abstract": "Electronic health records (EHR) are a vital data resource for research uses, including cohort identification, phenotyping, pharmacovigilance, and public health surveillance. To realize the promise of EHR data for accelerating clinical research, it is imperative to enable efficient and autonomous EHR data interrogation by end users such as biomedical researchers. This paper surveys state-of-art approaches and key methodological considerations to this purpose. We adapted a previously published conceptual framework for interactive information retrieval, which defines three entities: user, channel, and source, by elaborating on channels for query formulation in the context of facilitating end users to interrogate EHR data. We show the current progress in biomedical informatics mainly lies in support for query execution and information modeling, primarily due to emphases on infrastructure development for data integration and data access via self-service query tools, but has neglected user support needed during iteratively query formulation processes, which can be costly and error-prone. In contrast, the information science literature has offered elaborate theories and methods for user modeling and query formulation support. The two bodies of literature are complementary, implying opportunities for cross-disciplinary idea exchange. On this basis, we outline the directions for future informatics research to improve our understanding of user needs and requirements for facilitating autonomous interrogation of EHR data by biomedical researchers. We suggest that cross-disciplinary translational research between biomedical informatics and information science can benefit our research in facilitating efficient data access in life sciences.",

        "Abstract": "Precision medicine requires precise evidence-based practice and precise definition of the patients included in clinical studies for evidence generalization. Clinical research exclusion criteria define confounder patient characteristics for exclusion from a study. However, unnecessary exclusion criteria can weaken patient representativeness of study designs and generalizability of study results. This paper presents a method for identifying questionable exclusion criteria for 38 mental disorders. We extracted common eligibility features (CEFs) from all trials on these disorders from ClinicalTrials.gov. Network Analysis showed scale-free property of the CEF network, indicating uneven usage frequencies among CEFs. By comparing these CEFs' term frequencies in clinical trials' exclusion criteria and in the PubMed Medical Encyclopedia for matching conditions, we identified unjustified potential overuse of exclusion CEFs in mental disorder trials. Then we discussed the limitations in current exclusion criteria designs and made recommendations for achieving more patient-centered exclusion criteria definitions.",

Understanding such communication is indispensable for designing intelligent human-machine dialog systems that automate query formulation. This study investigates email communication and proposes a novel scheme for classifying dialog acts in clinical research query mediation. We analyzed 315 email messages exchanged in the communication for 20 data requests obtained from three institutions. The messages were segmented into 1333 utterance units. Through a rigorous process, we developed a classification scheme and applied it for dialog act annotation of the extracted utterances. Evaluation results with high inter-annotator agreement demonstrate the reliability of this scheme. This dataset is used to contribute preliminary understanding of dialog acts distribution and conversation flow in this dialog space.",

However, most successful repurposing cases so far have been achieved by serendipity. There is a need for more efficient computational methods for predicting new indications for existing drugs. This paper conducts a retrospective analysis of the temporal patterns of drug intervention trials for every drug in a pair of different conditions in ClinicalTrials.gov, including 550 drugs used for 451 conditions between 2003 and 2013. We found that drugs are often targeted towards conditions that are related by similar or identical eligibility criteria. We demonstrated the preliminary feasibility of predicting new target conditions for drug retesting among conditions with similar aggregated clinical trial eligibility criteria and confirmed this hypothesis using evidence from the literature.",

The primary innovation of RedX was the electronic health record view of patient data, to provide better contextual understanding for non-technical users in building complex data queries. The design of RedX around this need identified multiple functions that would use individual patient views to better understand population-based data, and vice-versa. During development, the more necessary and valuable components of RedX were refined, leading to a functional self-service query and cohort identification tool. However, with the improved capabilities and extensibility of other applications for data querying and navigation, our long-term implementation and dissemination plans have moved towards consolidation and alignment of RedX functions as enhancements in these other initiatives.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and its metastasis accounts for the majority of deaths. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC progression are not well characterized. In this study, we identified miR-409-3p as a tumor suppressor of CRC. MiR-409-3p expression was significantly downregulated in CRC tissue compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue, and reduced miR-409-3p expression was correlated with CRC metastasis. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that miR-409-3p negatively regulated CRC metastatic capacities, including suppressing cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. To explore the mechanism of action of miR-409-3p, we adopted a pathway and pathophysiological event-based target screening and validation approach, and found nine known metastasis-related genes as potential targets. The 3'-UTR binding assays between the candidates and miR-409-3p suggested that only GAB1, NR4A2 and LMO4 were directly regulated by the miRNA. However, endogenous expression analysis revealed that only GAB1 was modulated by miR-409-3p in CRC cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we provided evidence to conclude that GAB1 was partially responsible for miR-409-3p-mediated metastasis. Taken together, our data demonstrate that miR-409-3p is a metastatic suppressor, and post-transcriptional inhibition of the oncoprotein GAB1 is one of the mechanisms of action of this miRNA. Our finding suggests miR-409-3p might be a novel target for CRC metastasis treatment.",

The objective of this study is to examine methods and issues in summarizing and evaluating the accuracy of clinical data as compared to primary research data. We hypothesized that research survey data on a patient cohort could serve as a reference standard for uncovering potential biases in clinical data. We compared the summary statistics between clinical and research datasets. Seven clinical variables, i.e., height, weight, gender, ethnicity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and diabetes status, were included in the study. Our results show that the clinical data and research data had similar summary statistical profiles, but there are detectable differences in definitions and measurements for individual variables such as height, diastolic blood pressure, and diabetes status. We discuss the implications of these results and confirm the important considerations for using research data to verify clinical data accuracy.",

We randomly selected thirty interventional breast cancer clinical trials conducted at The New York-Presbyterian Hospital on the Columbia University Medical Center campus to create training (N=20) and testing (N=10) datasets. We utilized the Think-aloud protocol to gauge how clinical researchers identify and use major eligibility criteria to prescreen patients for clinical trials during an audio-recorded interview. A focus group session was held to understand the current prescreening process and investigate how it could be optimized to maximize recruitment rates. Using the grounded theory method, we annotated transcriptions to discover user rationale and desiderata behind major eligibility criteria in breast cancer clinical trials, which were later evaluated in a follow-up survey.",

We further stratified clinical trials according to various study characteristics (e.g., source country or study type) to understand potential factors influencing readability. Mainly caused by frequent use of technical jargons, a college reading level was found to be necessary to understand eligibility criteria text, a level much higher than the average literacy level of the general American population. The use of technical jargons should be minimized to simplify eligibility criteria text.",

However, GIST has not yet been evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper reports a simulation-based validation study for GIST. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, we demonstrated the effectiveness of GIST at quantifying the population representativeness of a set of related trials that differ in disease domains, study phases, sponsor types, and study designs, respectively. We also showed that among seven example medical conditions, the GIST of age increases from Phase I trials to Phase III trials in the seven disease domains and is the lowest in asthma trials. We concluded that GIST correlates with simulation-based generalizability results and is a valid metric for quantifying population representativeness of related clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "Terminologies can suffer from poor concept coverage due to delays in addition of new concepts. This study tests a similarity-based approach to recommending concepts from a text corpus to a terminology. Our approach involves extraction of candidate concepts from a given text corpus, which are represented using a set of features. The model learns the important features to characterize a concept and recommends new concepts to a terminology. Further, we propose a cost-effective evaluation methodology to estimate the effectiveness of terminology enrichment methods. To test our methodology, we use the clinical trial eligibility criteria free-text as an example text corpus to recommend concepts for SNOMED CT. We computed precision at various rank intervals to measure the performance of the methods. Results indicate that our automated algorithm is an effective method for concept recommendation.",

It is a valuable but relatively untapped resource for understanding trial design patterns and acquiring reusable trial design knowledge. We extracted common eligibility features using an unsupervised tag-mining method and mined their temporal usage patterns in clinical trials on various cancers. We then employed trend and network analysis to investigate two questions: (1) what eligibility features are frequently used to select patients for clinical trials within one cancer or across multiple cancers; and (2) what are the trends in eligibility feature adoption or discontinuation across cancer research domains? Our results showed that each cancer domain reuses a small set of eligibility features frequently for selecting cancer trial patients and some features are shared across different cancers, with value range adjustments for numerical measures. We discuss the implications for facilitating community-based clinical research knowledge sharing and reuse.",

        "Abstract": "The successful adoption by clinicians of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) contained in clinical information systems requires efficient translation of free-text guidelines into computable formats. Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to improve the efficiency of such translation. However, it is laborious to develop NLP to structure free-text CPGs using existing formal knowledge representations (KR). In response to this challenge, this vision paper discusses the value and feasibility of supporting symbiosis in text-based knowledge acquisition (KA) and KR. We compare two ontologies: (1) an ontology manually created by domain experts for CPG eligibility criteria and (2) an upper-level ontology derived from a semantic pattern-based approach for automatic KA from CPG eligibility criteria text. Then we discuss the strengths and limitations of interweaving KA and NLP for KR purposes and important considerations for achieving the symbiosis of KR and NLP for structuring CPGs to achieve evidence-based clinical practice.",

In the past, however, little attention has been paid to whether poor data quality merely introduces noise into EHR-derived datasets, or if there is potential for the creation of spurious signals and bias. In this study we use EHR data to demonstrate a statistically significant relationship between EHR completeness and patient health status, indicating that records with more data are likely to be more representative of sick patients than healthy ones, and therefore may not reflect the broader population found within the EHR.",

However, they are infrequently used mostly because of their poor interoperability with different health information technologies. Ontologies can augment portable ADSSs by providing an explicit knowledge representation for biomedical entities and their relationships, helping to standardize and integrate heterogeneous data resources. We developed a bacterial clinical infectious diseases ontology (BCIDO) using Protégé-OWL. BCIDO defines a controlled terminology for clinical infectious diseases along with domain knowledge commonly used in hospital settings for clinical infectious disease treatment decision-making. BCIDO has 599 classes and 2355 object properties. Terms were imported from or mapped to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, Unified Medical Language System, RxNorm and National Center for Bitechnology Information Organismal Classification where possible. Domain expert evaluation using the \"laddering\" technique, ontology visualization, and clinical notes and scenarios, confirmed the correctness and potential usefulness of BCIDO.",

Various clinical trial search engines have been designed to help health consumers identify trials for which they may be eligible. Unfortunately, knowledge of the usefulness and usability of their designs remains scarce. In this study, we used mixed methods, including time-motion analysis, think-aloud protocol, and survey, to evaluate five popular clinical trial search engines with 11 users. Differences in user preferences and time spent on each system were observed and correlated with user characteristics. In general, searching for applicable trials using these systems is a cognitively demanding task. Our results show that user perceptions of these systems are multifactorial. The survey indicated eTACTS being the generally preferred system, but this finding did not persist among all mixed methods. This study confirms the value of mixed-methods for a comprehensive system evaluation. Future system designers must be aware that different users groups expect different functionalities.",

However, understanding of the BQM process is limited in the literature. To bridge this gap, we performed the initial steps of a cognitive task analysis using 31 BQM instances conducted between one analyst and 22 researchers in one academic department. We identified five top-level tasks, i.e., clarify research statement, explain clinical process, identify related data elements, locate EHR data element, and end BQM with either a database query or unmet, infeasible information needs, and 10 sub-tasks. We evaluated the BQM task model with seven data analysts from different clinical research institutions. Evaluators found all the tasks completely or semi-valid. This study contributes initial knowledge towards the development of a generalizable cognitive task representation for BQM.",

We installed a free usage logging service, Google Analytics, on CUSP and applied time series analysis to compare the usage patterns of the two modes of CUSP: restricted (authenticated) and open access. More users searched by person names than by topics, although the latter enables in-depth vertical search of co-author or co-investigator networks for grants or publications. The open-access mode received more page views but less average time spent on each page than the restricted access mode. The numbers of unique users and searches have increased over the time. This study contributes a trend analysis framework for understanding the usage of RNSs and early knowledge of the usage of an open-access RNS.",

Existing methods largely depend on self-reporting and often fail to elicit implicit or fine-grained user needs. We hypothesized that functional software would address this problem by presenting to users existing technology while simultaneously encouraging users to optimize workflow. Using clinical research visit scheduling as an example, we used a piece of software under development that was called IMPACT to reveal user needs iteratively. The identified user needs explained why most clinical research coordinators still rely on paper to schedule clinical research visits. The common user needs themes such as information completeness for software to be useful may generalize to other clinical decision support. This paper contributes valuable firsthand knowledge about user needs for decision support for clinical research visit scheduling among clinical research coordinators and a generalizable methodology for collecting and analyzing software usage data to inform user needs elicitation.",

Electronic health records (EHRs) are necessary to enable the Learning Health System; however, a source of frustration is that current systems fail to adequately support research needs. We propose a model for enhancing EHRs to collect structured and standards-based clinical research data during clinical encounters that promotes efficiency and computational reuse of quality data for both care and research. The model integrates Common Data Elements (CDEs) for clinical research into existing clinical documentation workflows, leveraging executable documentation guidance within the EHR to support coordinated, standardized data collection for both patient care and clinical research.",

Towards this goal, this paper presents a novel data resource for enabling such analyses. Our method includes two parts: (1) parsing and indexing eligibility criteria text; and (2) mining common eligibility features and attributes of common numeric features (e.g., A1c). We designed and built a database called \"Commonalities in Target Populations of Clinical Trials\" (COMPACT), which stores structured eligibility criteria and trial metadata in a readily computable format. We illustrate its use in an example analytic module called CONECT using COMPACT as the backend. Type 2 diabetes is used as an example to analyze commonalities in the target populations of 4,493 clinical trials on this disease.",

As patient self-reported health data are increasingly available, it is useful to know how the two data sources compare with each other for phenotyping. This study addresses this research question. We used self-reported diabetes status for 2,249 patients treated at Columbia University Medical Center and the well-known eMERGE EHR phenotyping algorithm for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) to conduct the experiment. The eMERGE algorithm achieved high specificity (.97) but low sensitivity (.32) among this patient cohort. About 87% of the patients with self-reported diabetes had at least one ICD-9 code, one medication, or one lab result supporting a DM2 diagnosis, implying the remaining 13% may have missing or incorrect self-reports. We discuss the tradeoffs in both data sources and in combining them for phenotyping.",

Yet little is known about how data request forms are constructed and how effective they are likely to be. We conducted a content analysis of ten data request forms from CTSA-supported institutions. We found that most of the forms over-emphasized the collection of metadata that were not considered germane to the actual data needs. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to improve the quality of data request forms in support of clinical and translational research.",

        "Abstract": "Underspecified user needs and frequent lack of a gold standard reference are typical barriers to technology evaluation. To address this problem, this paper presents a two-phase evaluation framework involving usability experts (phase 1) and end-users (phase 2). In phase 1, a cross-system functionality alignment between expert-derived user needs and system functions was performed to inform the choice of \"the best available\" comparison system to enable a cognitive walkthrough in phase 1 and a comparative effectiveness evaluation in phase 2. During phase 2, five quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods are mixed to assess usability: time-motion analysis, software log, questionnaires - System Usability Scale and the Unified Theory of Acceptance of Use of Technology, think-aloud protocols, and unstructured interviews. Each method contributes data for a unique measure (e.g., time motion analysis contributes task-completion-time; software log contributes action transition frequency). The measures are triangulated to yield complementary insights regarding user-perceived ease-of-use, functionality integration, anxiety during use, and workflow impact. To illustrate its use, we applied this framework in a formative evaluation of a software called Integrated Model for Patient Care and Clinical Trials (IMPACT). We conclude that this mixed-methods evaluation framework enables an integrated assessment of user needs satisfaction and user-perceived usefulness and usability of a novel design. This evaluation framework effectively bridges the gap between co-evolving user needs and technology designs during iterative prototyping and is particularly useful when it is difficult for users to articulate their needs for technology support due to the lack of a baseline.",

        "Abstract": "Developing electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping algorithms involves generating queries that run across the EHR data repository. Algorithms are commonly assessed within demonstration studies. There remains, however, little emphasis on assessing the precision and accuracy of measurement methods during the evaluation process. Depending on the complexity of an algorithm, interim refinements may be required to improve measurement methods. Therefore, we develop an evaluation framework that incorporates both measurement and demonstration studies. We evaluate a baseline EHR phenotyping algorithm for drug induced liver injury (DILI) developed in collaboration with electronic Medical Records Genomics (eMERGE) network participants. We conduct a measurement study and report qualitative (i.e., perceptions of evaluation approach effectiveness) and quantitative (i.e., inter-rater reliability) measures. We also conduct a demonstration study and report qualitative (i.e., appropriateness of results) and quantitative (i.e., positive predictive value) measures. Given results from the measurement study, our evaluation approach underwent multiple changes including the addition of laboratory value visualization and an expanded review of clinical notes. Results from the demonstration study informed changes to our algorithm. For example, given the goal of eMERGE to identify patients who may have a genetic susceptibility to DILI, we excluded overdose patients.",

We present a framework to dynamically refine clinical trial search results towards a manually reviewable number of studies. At this aim, a set of frequent features are extracted automatically offline from the eligibility criteria of a representative subset of clinical trials. These features are then presented dynamically to the users based on feature co-occurrences and user interactions to reduce the number of resulting documents. Experiments on ClinicalTrials.gov showed that using an average of four features, it is feasible to reduce the results of a simple search from over a thousand to ten.",

However, this approach does not scale up and is time-consuming and expensive. We analyzed query mediation dialogues to inform future designs of intelligent query mediation systems. Thirty-one mediated query sessions for 22 research projects were recorded and transcribed. We analyzed 10 of these to develop an annotation schema for dialogue acts through iterative refinement. Three coders independently annotated all 3160 dialogue acts. We assessed the inter-rater agreement and resolved disagreement by group consensus. This study contributes early knowledge of the query negotiation space for medical research. We conclude that research data query formulation is not a straightforward translation from researcher data needs to database queries, but rather iterative, process-oriented needs assessment and refinement.",

This paper proposes a novel methodology to derive a semantic index for clinical eligibility documents based on a controlled vocabulary of frequent tags, which are automatically mined from the text. We applied this method to eligibility criteria on ClinicalTrials.gov and report that frequent tags (1) define an effective and efficient index of clinical trials and (2) are unlikely to grow radically when the repository increases. We proposed to apply the semantic index to filter clinical trial search results and we concluded that frequent tags reduce the result space more efficiently than an uncontrolled set of UMLS concepts. Overall, unsupervised mining of frequent tags from clinical text leads to an effective semantic index for the clinical eligibility documents and promotes their computational reuse.",

        "Abstract": "The increasing need for interdisciplinary team sciences makes it vital for academic research departments to publicize their research and educational resources as part of \"linked data\" on the semantic web to facilitate research networking and recruitment. We extended an open-source ontology, VIVO, to represent the research and educational resources in an academic biomedical informatics department to enable ontology-based information storage and retrieval. Using participatory design methods, we surveyed representative types of visitors to the department web site to understand their information needs, and incorporated these needs into the ontology design. We added 114 classes and 186 properties to VIVO. Generalizability and scalability are the measures used in our theoretical evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trial eligibility criteria define fine-grained characteristics of research volunteers for various disease trials and hence are a promising data source for disease profiling. This paper explores the feasibility of using disease-specific common eligibility features (CEFs) for representing diseases and understanding their relatedness. We extracted disease-specific CEFs from eligibility criteria on ClinicalTrials.gov for three illustrative categories - cancers, mental disorders and chronic diseases - each including seven diseases. We then constructed disease-specific CEF networks to assess the degree of overlap among the diseases. Using these automatically derived networks, we observed several findings that were confirmed in medicine. For example, we highlighted connections among schizophrenia, epilepsy and depression. We also identified a link between Crohn's disease and arthritis. These observations confirm the value of using clinical trial eligibility criteria for identifying disease relatedness. We further discuss the implications of CEFs for standardizing clinical trial eligibility criteria through reuse.",

        "Abstract": "We demonstrate the importance of explicit definitions of electronic health record (EHR) data completeness and how different conceptualizations of completeness may impact findings from EHR-derived datasets. This study has important repercussions for researchers and clinicians engaged in the secondary use of EHR data. We describe four prototypical definitions of EHR completeness: documentation, breadth, density, and predictive completeness. Each definition dictates a different approach to the measurement of completeness. These measures were applied to representative data from NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital's clinical data warehouse. We found that according to any definition, the number of complete records in our clinical database is far lower than the nominal total. The proportion that meets criteria for completeness is heavily dependent on the definition of completeness used, and the different definitions generate different subsets of records. We conclude that the concept of completeness in EHR is contextual. We urge data consumers to be explicit in how they define a complete record and transparent about the limitations of their data.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a clinical research visit scheduling system that can potentially coordinate clinical research visits with patient care visits and increase efficiency at clinical sites where clinical and research activities occur simultaneously. Participatory Design methods were applied to support requirements engineering and to create this software called Integrated Model for Patient Care and Clinical Trials (IMPACT). Using a multi-user constraint satisfaction and resource optimization algorithm, IMPACT automatically synthesizes temporal availability of various research resources and recommends the optimal dates and times for pending research visits. We conducted scenario-based evaluations with 10 clinical research coordinators (CRCs) from diverse clinical research settings to assess the usefulness, feasibility, and user acceptance of IMPACT. We obtained qualitative feedback using semi-structured interviews with the CRCs. Most CRCs acknowledged the usefulness of IMPACT features. Support for collaboration within research teams and interoperability with electronic health records and clinical trial management systems were highly requested features. Overall, IMPACT received satisfactory user acceptance and proves to be potentially useful for a variety of clinical research settings. Our future work includes comparing the effectiveness of IMPACT with that of existing scheduling solutions on the market and conducting field tests to formally assess user adoption.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes our considerations and methods for implementing an open-source centralized research data repository (CRDR) and reports its impact on retrospective outcomes research capacity in the urology department at Columbia University. We performed retrospective pretest and post-test analyses of user acceptance, workflow efficiency, and publication quantity and quality (measured by journal impact factor) before and after the implementation. The CRDR transformed the research workflow and enabled a new research model. During the pre- and post-test periods, the department's average annual retrospective study publication rate was 11.5 and 25.6, respectively; the average publication impact score was 1.7 and 3.1, respectively. The new model was adopted by 62.5% (5/8) of the clinical scientists within the department. Additionally, four basic science researchers outside the department took advantage of the implemented model. The average proximate time required to complete a retrospective study decreased from 12 months before the implementation to <6 months after the implementation. Implementing a CRDR appears to be effective in enhancing the outcomes research capacity for one academic department.",

This study contributes a method for evaluating RNSs and initial usage knowledge of one RNS obtained from using this method. We designed a log for an institutional RNS, defined categories of users and tasks, and analyzed correlations between usage patterns and user and query types. Our results show that scientific professionals spend more time performing deep Web searching on RNSs than generic Google users and we also show that retrieving scientist profiles is faster on an RNS than on Google (3.5 seconds vs. 34.2 seconds) whereas organization-specific browsing on a RNS takes longer than on Google (117.0 seconds vs. 34.2 seconds). Usage patterns vary by user role, e.g., faculty performed more informational queries than administrators, which implies role-specific user support is needed for RNSs.",

        "Abstract": "Effective clinical text processing requires accurate extraction and representation of temporal expressions. Multiple temporal information extraction models were developed but a similar need for extracting temporal expressions in eligibility criteria (e.g., for eligibility determination) remains. We identified the temporal knowledge representation requirements of eligibility criteria by reviewing 100 temporal criteria. We developed EliXR-TIME, a frame-based representation designed to support semantic annotation for temporal expressions in eligibility criteria by reusing applicable classes from well-known clinical temporal knowledge representations. We used EliXR-TIME to analyze a training set of 50 new temporal eligibility criteria. We evaluated EliXR-TIME using an additional random sample of 20 eligibility criteria with temporal expressions that have no overlap with the training data, yielding 92.7% (76 / 82) inter-coder agreement on sentence chunking and 72% (72 / 100) agreement on semantic annotation. We conclude that this knowledge representation can facilitate semantic annotation of the temporal expressions in eligibility criteria.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical research is the foundation for advancing the practice of medicine. However, the lack of seamless integration between clinical research and patient care workflow impedes recruitment efficiency, escalates research costs, and hence threatens the entire clinical research enterprise. Increased use of electronic health records (EHRs) holds promise for facilitating this integration but must surmount regulatory obstacles. Among the unintended consequences of current research oversight are barriers to accessing patient information for prescreening and recruitment, coordinating scheduling of clinical and research visits, and reconciling information about clinical and research drugs. We conclude that the EHR alone cannot overcome barriers in conducting clinical trials and comparative effectiveness research. Patient privacy and human subject protection policies should be clarified at the local level to exploit optimally the full potential of EHRs, while continuing to ensure participant safety. Increased alignment of policies that regulate the clinical and research use of EHRs could help fulfill the vision of more efficiently obtaining clinical research evidence to improve human health.",

        "Abstract": "Although the expression of angiogenin (ANG), an angiogenic and tumorigenic factor, is elevated in various types of cancers, its regulation mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, in silico search predicted that miR-409-3p targeted to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the ANG mRNA. Overexpression of miR-409-3p in fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells resulted in decreased steady-state level of ANG transcript and ANG production which were achieved through direct binding of this miRNA to the ANG 3'UTR. The suppressions of miR-409-3p to rRNA transcription, cell proliferation and vasculogenic mimicry could be partially restored by overexpression of ANG with a mutated binding site of miR-409-3p within the ANG 3'UTR. Ectopic expression of miR-409-3p in transplanted HT1080 cells led to the retardation of tumor growth, vascularization and lung metastasis in mouse tumor xenografts. In these xenografts tissues, the expression of miR-409-3p displayed an inverse correlation with ANG, which was also detected in human fibrosarcoma samples. In addition, the suppression effects of miR-409-3p on cell proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro were also found in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that miR-409-3p inhibits tumor growth, vascularization and metastasis through down-regulating ANG expression.",

        "Abstract": "The increasing availability of personal genome data has led to escalating needs by consumers to understand the implications of their gene sequences. At present, poorly integrated genetic knowledge has not met these needs. This proof-of-concept study proposes a similarity-based approach to assess the disease risk predisposition for personal genomes. We hypothesize that the semantic similarity between a personal genome and a disease can indicate the disease risks in the person. We developed a knowledge network that integrates existing knowledge of genes, diseases, and symptoms from six sources using the Semantic Web standard, Resource Description Framework (RDF). We then used latent relationships between genes and diseases derived from our knowledge network to measure the semantic similarity between a personal genome and a genetic disease. For demonstration, we showed the feasibility of assessing the disease risks in one personal genome and discussed related methodology issues.",

        "Abstract": "The scarcity of cost-effective patient identification methods represents a significant barrier to clinical research. Research recruitment alerts have been designed to facilitate physician referrals but limited support is available to clinical researchers. We conducted a retrospective data analysis to evaluate the efficacy of a real-time patient identification alert delivered to clinical research coordinators recruiting for a clinical prospective cohort study. Data from log analysis and informal interviews with coordinators were triangulated. Over a 12-month period, 11,295 were screened electronically, 1,449 were interviewed, and 282 were enrolled. The enrollment rates for the alert and two other conventional methods were 4.65%, 2.01%, and 1.34% respectively. A taxonomy of eligibility status was proposed to precisely categorize research patients. Practical ineligibility factors were identified and their correlation with age and gender were analyzed. We conclude that the automatic prescreening alert improves screening efficiency and is an effective aid to clinical research coordinators.",

However, eligibility criteria are often written as free text, which is not amenable for computer processing. In this paper, we present an ontology-based approach to extracting temporal information from clinical research eligibility criteria. We generated temporal labels using a frame-based temporal ontology. We manually annotated 150 free-text eligibility criteria using the temporal labels and trained a parser using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to automatically extract temporal expressions from eligibility criteria. An evaluation of an additional 60 randomly selected eligibility criteria using manual review achieved an overall precision of 83%, a recall of 79%, and an F-score of 80%. We illustrate the application of temporal extraction with the use cases of question answering and free-text criteria querying.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines PubMed knowledge and Electronic Health Records to develop a weighted Bayesian Network Inference (BNI) model for pancreatic cancer prediction. We selected 20 common risk factors associated with pancreatic cancer and used PubMed knowledge to weigh the risk factors. A keyword-based algorithm was developed to extract and classify PubMed abstracts into three categories that represented positive, negative, or neutral associations between each risk factor and pancreatic cancer. Then we designed a weighted BNI model by adding the normalized weights into a conventional BNI model. We used this model to extract the EHR values for patients with or without pancreatic cancer, which then enabled us to calculate the prior probabilities for the 20 risk factors in the BNI. The software iDiagnosis was designed to use this weighted BNI model for predicting pancreatic cancer. In an evaluation using a case-control dataset, the weighted BNI model significantly outperformed the conventional BNI and two other classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine). We conclude that the weighted BNI using PubMed knowledge and EHR data shows remarkable accuracy improvement over existing representative methods for pancreatic cancer prediction.",

The UMLS Metathesaurus and SPECIALIST Lexical Tools were used to extract and normalize UMLS recognizable terms. When annotated with Semantic Network types, the corpus had a lexical ambiguity of 1.57 (=total types for unique lexemes / total unique lexemes) and a word occurrence ambiguity of 1.96 (=total type occurrences / total word occurrences). A set of semantic preference rules was developed and applied to completely eliminate ambiguity in semantic type assignment. The lexicon covered 95.95% UMLS-recognizable terms in our corpus. A total of 20 UMLS semantic types, representing about 17% of all the distinct semantic types assigned to corpus lexemes, covered about 80% of the vocabulary of our corpus.",

This paper reports some data quality issues we encountered in a survival analysis of pancreatic cancer patients. Using the clinical data warehouse at Columbia University Medical Center in the City of New York, we mined EHR data elements collected between 1999 and 2009 for a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients. Of the 3068 patients who had ICD-9-CM diagnoses for pancreatic cancer, only 1589 had corresponding disease documentation in pathology reports. Incompleteness was the leading data quality issue; many study variables had missing values to various degrees. Inaccuracy and inconsistency were the next common problems. In this paper, we present the manifestations of these data quality issues and discuss some strategies for using emerging informatics technologies to solve these problems.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to learning semantic classes of clinical research eligibility criteria. It uses the UMLS Semantic Types to represent semantic features and the Hierarchical Clustering method to group similar eligibility criteria. By establishing a gold standard using two independent raters, we evaluated the coverage and accuracy of the induced semantic classes. On 2,718 random eligibility criteria sentences, the inter-rater classification agreement was 85.73%. In a 10-fold validation test, the average Precision, Recall and F-score of the classification results of a decision-tree classifier were 87.8%, 88.0%, and 87.7% respectively. Our induced classes well aligned with 16 out of 17 eligibility criteria classes defined by the BRIDGE model. We discuss the potential of this method and our future work.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Current staging systems are not accurate for classifying pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) by risk. Here, we developed a prognostic model for PETs and compared it to the WHO classification system. METHODS: We identified 98 patients diagnosed with PET at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center (1999 to 2009). Tumor and clinical characteristics were retrieved and associations with survival were assessed by univariate Cox analysis. A multivariable model was constructed and a risk score was calculated; the prognostic strength of our model was assessed with the concordance index. RESULTS: Our cohort had median age of 60 years and consisted of 61.2% women; median follow-up time was 10.4 months (range: 0.1-99.6) with a 5-year survival of 61.5%. The majority of PETs were non-functional and no difference was observed between functional and non-functional tumors with respect to WHO stage, age, pathologic characteristics or survival. Distant metastases, aspartate aminotransferase-AST and surgical resection (HR=3.39, 95% CI: 1.38-8.35, p=0.008, HR=3.73, 95% CI: 1.20-11.57, p=0.023 and HR=0.20, 95% CI: 0.08-0.51, p<0.001 respectively) were the strongest predictors in the univariate analysis. Age, perineural and/or lymphovascular invasion, distant metastases and AST were the independent prognostic factors in the final multivariable model; a risk score was calculated and classified patients into low (n=40), intermediate (n=48) and high risk (n=10) groups. The concordance index of our model was 0.93 compared to 0.72 for the WHO system. CONCLUSION: Our prognostic model was highly accurate in stratifying patients by risk; novel approaches as such could thus be incorporated into clinical decisions.",

        "Abstract": "Standards-based, computable knowledge representations for eligibility criteria are increasingly needed to provide computer-based decision support for automated research participant screening, clinical evidence application, and clinical research knowledge management. We surveyed the literature and identified five aspects of eligibility criteria knowledge representation that contribute to the various research and clinical applications: the intended use of computable eligibility criteria, the classification of eligibility criteria, the expression language for representing eligibility rules, the encoding of eligibility concepts, and the modeling of patient data. We consider three of these aspects (expression language, codification of eligibility concepts, and patient data modeling) to be essential constructs of a formal knowledge representation for eligibility criteria. The requirements for each of the three knowledge constructs vary for different use cases, which therefore should inform the development and choice of the constructs toward cost-effective knowledge representation efforts. We discuss the implications of our findings for standardization efforts toward knowledge representation for sharable and computable eligibility criteria.",

        "Abstract": "Principal-component analysis (PCA) has been used for decades to summarize the human genetic variation across geographic regions and to infer population migration history. Reduction of spurious associations due to population structure is crucial for the success of disease association studies. Recently, PCA has also become a popular method for detecting population structure and correction of population stratification in disease association studies. Inspired by manifold learning, we propose a novel method based on spectral graph theory. Regarding each study subject as a node with suitably defined weights for its edges to close neighbors, one can form a weighted graph. We suggest using the spectrum of the associated graph Laplacian operator, namely, Laplacian eigenfunctions, to infer population structures instead of principal components (PCs). For the whole genome-wide association data for the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) provided by Genetic Workshop Analysis 16, Laplacian eigenfunctions revealed more meaningful structures of the underlying population than PCA. The proposed method has connection to PCA, and it naturally includes PCA as a special case. Our simple method is computationally fast and is suitable for disease studies at the genome-wide scale.",

Out of the 193 E-screened patients, 125 met the age criterion (\"age>or=40\"). For all of these 125 patients, the performance of E-screening was compared with investigator review. E-screening achieved a negative predictive accuracy of 100% (95% CI: 98-100%), a positive predictive accuracy of 13% (95% CI: 6-13%), a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 45-100%), and a specificity of 84% (95% CI: 82-84%). The method maximized the use of a patient database query (i.e., excluded ineligible patients with a 100% accuracy and automatically assembled patient information to facilitate manual review of only patients who were classified as \"potentially eligible\" by E-screening) and significantly reduced the screening burden associated with the ACCORD trial.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of electronic medical record (EMR) systems has made mass-screening for clinical trials viable through secondary uses of clinical data, which often exist in both structured and free text formats. The tradeoffs of using information in either data format for clinical trials screening are understudied. This paper compares the results of clinical trial eligibility queries over ICD9-encoded diagnoses and NLP-processed textual discharge summaries. The strengths and weaknesses of both data sources are summarized along the following dimensions: information completeness, expressiveness, code granularity, and accuracy of temporal information. We conclude that NLP-processed patient reports supplement important information for eligibility screening and should be used in combination with structured data.",

        "Abstract": "Angiogenin is an angiogenic factor involved in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of angiogenin's action remains elusive. In the present study, we identified fibulin 1, an extracellular matrix and plasma glycoprotein, as an angiogenin-interacting molecule by yeast two-hybrid screening. This interaction was further confirmed by two different approaches. First, fibulin 1 was co-immunoprecipitated with angiogenin by anti-angiogenin monoclonal antibody in vitro, suggesting angiogenin binds with fibulin 1 directly. Then fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis showed that fibulin 1 interacted with angiogenin in COS-7 cells, showing that the binding could occur in a cellular context. As fibulin 1 plays an important role in cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and stabilizes new-forming blood vessel wall, the interaction between fibulin 1 and angiogenin might underline one possible mechanism of angiogenin in angiogenesis and/or tumorigenesis.",

Methods such as ontology alignment or use of metadata neither scale nor fundamentally alleviate semantic heterogeneity among information sources. In the context of the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid program, the Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) has been making an ambitious effort to harmonize existing information models for clinical research from a variety of sources and modeling agreed-upon semantics shared by the technical harmonization committee and the developers of these models. This paper provides some observations on this user-centered semantic harmonization effort and its inherent technical and social challenges. The authors also compare BRIDG with related efforts to achieve semantic interoperability in healthcare, including UMLS, InterMed, the Semantic Web, and the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations initiative. The BRIDG project demonstrates the feasibility of user-centered collaborative domain modeling as an approach to semantic harmonization, but also highlights a number of technology gaps in support of collaborative semantic harmonization that remain to be filled.",

We also designed a collaborative writing system to facilitate its protocol reviewing and revising processes over the Internet. After a series of iterative prototyping and formative evaluations over the past two years, we identified a social-technical gap in our group work support research at SWOG. This gap consists of technical challenges, expanding user needs, conflicting user needs from different roles, insufficient incentive for using groupware technology by certain members, subtle organizational nuances, and the changing organizational structure. This paper describes our longitudinal evaluations results and elaborates on the social-technical gap. We think this gap may generalize to other healthcare group work settings.",

        "Abstract": "Group work is an essential part of modern health care. Although there have been advances in the technology of communication, these have not necessarily led to efficient and effective communication among collaborating health-care professionals. Instead, barriers such as varied organizational cultures, different training backgrounds, and varied time schedules can overwhelm technological solutions and impede efficient communication. We focus on one particular sort of collaboration, that of group work around a clinical trial protocol, where the collaboration is asynchronous and the participants are geographically distributed. In this work setting, we have applied a computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) approach in two distinct ways. First, we used observational methods to uncover and understand a complex set of communication behaviors and needs. Second, we used participatory design and iterative prototyping to design a system that aims to improve communication and work flow among these collaborators. We found that these methods work well in tandem-our observational study helped better inform our design, and our prototyping cycles provided additional insight into the work. More specifically, we were able to identify a set of communication problems in the work that led us to specify a set of design desiderata for systems that support asynchronous collaboration around an evolving medical document.",

        "Abstract": "Increasing complexity in medicine has caused clinical trial experts with disparate backgrounds from multiple organizations to collaborate when developing clinical trial protocols. Although many protocol-authoring tools provide computerbased decision support to assist in protocol writing, few of them provide sufficient collaboration support for a group of protocol writers. The iterative group writing activities among interdisciplinary clinical trial experts call for advanced tool support. Here we present a web-based protocol writing system with integrated support for collaborative reviewing and collaborative editing. The system uses a shared database to store threaded review comments and version information for electronic protocols. It also captures rich group event information to provide cross-activity awareness and to facilitate self-coordination within the collaborative writing team. We believe that our system can help streamline collaborative clinical trial protocol writing processes.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trial protocol documents play an important role in clinical research. However, clinical protocol writing remains a complex and relatively un-studied process. Protocols are often written by teams of people, yet little prior research has captured the problems or analyzed the collaboration support needs of protocol writers. Here we present the results of an initial ethnographic study into the clinical trial protocol writing processes at a representative cooperative clinical trial group funded by National Cancer Institute (NCI). We analyzed the collaborative nature of the writing process, identified common problems, derived information and communication support needs of collaborative clinical protocol writers, and provided recommendations to streamline the process. We believe that this paper contributes useful implications for the design of future collaborative clinical protocol writing tools.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trial protocols include detailed temporal constraints on treatment and associated tasks. Unlike health-care guidelines, protocols are highly prescriptive. Therefore, informatics applications that enforce such temporal constraints are more directly useful with protocols than with guidelines. Although there are some temporal knowledge representation efforts for health-care guidelines, we find these to be insufficiently expressive for clinical trial protocols. In this paper, we focus on temporal knowledge representation for clinical trial protocols and the task of patient-specific scheduling in protocols. We define a temporal ontology, use it to encode clinical trial protocols, and describe a prototype tool to carry out patient-specific scheduling for the tasks in protocols. We predict that an expressive temporal knowledge representation can support a number of scheduling and management tasks for protocol-based care.",
