        "Abstract": "Lung infection by influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of global mortality from lung injury, a disease defined by widespread dysfunction of the lung's air-blood barrier. Endocytosis of IAV virions by the alveolar epithelium - the cells that determine barrier function - is central to barrier loss mechanisms. Here, we address the current understanding of the mechanistic steps that lead to endocytosis in the alveolar epithelium, with an eye to how the unique structure of lung alveoli shapes endocytic mechanisms. We highlight where future studies of alveolar interactions with IAV virions may lead to new therapeutic approaches for IAV-induced lung injury.",

        "Abstract": "Failure of the lung's endothelial barrier underlies lung injury, which causes the high mortality acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Multiple organ failure predisposes to the mortality, but mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a component of the mitochondrial inner membrane, plays a role in the barrier failure. Subsequent lung-liver cross talk mediated by neutrophil activation causes liver congestion. We intranasally instilled lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Then, we viewed the lung endothelium by real-time confocal imaging of the isolated, blood-perfused mouse lung. LPS caused alveolar-capillary transfer of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial depolarization in lung venular capillaries. The mitochondrial depolarization was inhibited by transfection of alveolar Catalase and vascular knockdown of ",

        "Abstract": "High mortality in acute lung injury (ALI) results from sustained proinflammatory signaling by alveolar receptors, such as TNF-Î± receptor type 1 (TNFR1). Factors that determine the sustained signaling are not known. Unexpectedly, optical imaging of live alveoli revealed a major TNF-Î±-induced surge of alveolar TNFR1 due to a Ca2+-dependent mechanism that decreased the cortical actin fence. Mouse mortality due to inhaled LPS was associated with cofilin activation, actin loss, and the TNFR1 surge. The constitutively active form of the GTPase, Rac1 (V12Rac1), given intranasally (i.n.) as a noncovalent construct with a cell-permeable peptide, enhanced alveolar filamentous actin (F-actin) and blocked the TNFR1 surge. V12Rac1 also protected against ALI-induced mortality resulting from i.n. instillation of LPS or of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We propose a potentially new therapeutic paradigm in which actin enhancement by exogenous Rac1 strengthens the alveolar actin fence, protecting against proinflammatory receptor hyperexpression, and therefore blocking ALI.",

        "Abstract": "Acute lung immunity to inhaled pathogens elicits defensive pneumonitis that may convert to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), causing high mortality. Mechanisms underlying the conversion are not understood, but are of intense interest because of the ARDS-induced mortality in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Here, by optical imaging of live lungs we show that key to the lethality is the functional status of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering across the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) in the alveolar type 2 cells (AT2), which protect alveolar stability. In mice subjected to ARDS by airway exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, there was marked loss of MCU expression in AT2. The ability of mice to survive ARDS depended on the extent to which the MCU expression recovered, indicating that the viability of Ca2+ buffering by AT2 mitochondria critically determines ARDS severity. Mitochondrial transfer to enhance AT2 MCU expression might protect against ARDS.",

        "Abstract": "Acid aspiration, which can result from several etiologies, including postoperative complications, leads to direct contact of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) with the alveolar epithelium. As a result, rapid endothelial activation induces alveolar inflammation, leading to life-threatening pulmonary edema. Because mechanisms underlying the rapid endothelial activation are not understood, here we determined responses in real time through optical imaging of alveoli of live mouse lungs. By alveolar micropuncture, we microinfused concentrated HCl in the alveolar lumen. As expected, acid contact with the epithelium caused rapid, but transient, apical injury. However, there was no concomitant membrane injury to the endothelium. Nevertheless, H2O2-mediated epithelial-endothelial paracrine signaling induced endothelial barrier failure, as detected by microvascular dextran leakage and lung water quantification. Remarkably, endothelial mitochondria regulated the barrier failure by activating uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), thereby inducing transient mitochondrial depolarization that led to cofilin-induced actin depolymerization. Knockdown, or endothelium-targeted deletion of UCP2 expression, blocked these responses, including pulmonary edema. To our knowledge, these findings are the first to mechanistically implicate endothelial mitochondria in acid-induced barrier deterioration and pulmonary edema. We suggest endothelial UCP2 may be a therapeutic target for acid-induced acute lung injury.",

The crosstalk can occur in a forward direction, as from alveolus to capillary, or in a reverse direction, as from capillary to alveolus. The crosstalk direction likely depends on the site at which pathogens first initiate signaling. Thus, forward crosstalk may occur when inhaled pathogens encounter the alveolar epithelium, while reverse crosstalk may result from interactions of blood-borne pathogens with the endothelium. Here, we review the factors that regulate these two directions of signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain USA300 causes tissue injury, multiorgan failure, and high mortality. However, the mechanisms by which the bacteria adhere to, then stabilize on, mucosal surfaces before causing injury remain unclear. We addressed these issues through the first real-time determinations of USA300-alveolar interactions in live lungs. We found that within minutes, inhaled USA300 established stable, self-associated microaggregates in niches at curved, but not at flat, regions of the alveolar wall. The microaggregates released Î±-hemolysin toxin, causing localized alveolar injury, as indicated by epithelial dye loss, mitochondrial depolarization, and cytosolic Ca2+ increase. Spread of cytosolic Ca2+ through intercellular gap junctions to adjoining, uninfected alveoli caused pulmonary edema. Systemic pretreatment with vancomycin, a USA300-cidal antibiotic, failed to protect mice infected with inhaled WT USA300. However, vancomycin pretreatment markedly abrogated mortality in mice infected with mutant USA300 that lacked the aggregation-promoting factor PhnD. We interpret USA300-induced mortality as having resulted from rapid bacterial aggregation in alveolar niches. These findings indicate, for the first time to our knowledge, that alveolar microanatomy is critical in promoting the aggregation and, hence, in causing USA300-induced alveolar injury. We propose that in addition to antibiotics, strategies for bacterial disaggregation may constitute novel therapy against USA300-induced lung injury.",

        "Abstract": "An explosion of new information about mitochondria reveals that their importance extends well beyond their time-honored function as the \"powerhouse of the cell.\" In this Perspectives article, we summarize new evidence showing that mitochondria are at the center of a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent pathway governing the response to hypoxia and to mitochondrial quality control. The potential role of the mitochondrial genome as a sentinel molecule governing cytotoxic responses of lung cells to ROS stress also is highlighted. Additional attention is devoted to the fate of damaged mitochondrial DNA relative to its involvement as a damage-associated molecular pattern driving adverse lung and systemic cell responses in severe illness or trauma. Finally, emerging strategies for replenishing normal populations of mitochondria after damage, either through promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis or via mitochondrial transfer, are discussed.",

        "Title": "Sessile alveolar macrophages communicate with alveolar epithelium to modulate immunity.",
        "Abstract": "The tissue-resident macrophages of barrier organs constitute the first line of defence against pathogens at the systemic interface with the ambient environment. In the lung, resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) provide a sentinel function against inhaled pathogens. Bacterial constituents ligate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on AMs, causing AMs to secrete proinflammatory cytokines that activate alveolar epithelial receptors, leading to recruitment of neutrophils that engulf pathogens. Because the AM-induced response could itself cause tissue injury, it is unclear how AMs modulate the response to prevent injury. Here, using real-time alveolar imaging in situ, we show that a subset of AMs attached to the alveolar wall form connexin 43 (Cx43)-containing gap junction channels with the epithelium. During lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, the AMs remained sessile and attached to the alveoli, and they established intercommunication through synchronized Ca(2+) waves, using the epithelium as the conducting pathway. The intercommunication was immunosuppressive, involving Ca(2+)-dependent activation of Akt, because AM-specific knockout of Cx43 enhanced alveolar neutrophil recruitment and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage. A picture emerges of a novel immunomodulatory process in which a subset of alveolus-attached AMs intercommunicates immunosuppressive signals to reduce endotoxin-induced lung inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Live lung imaging has spanned the discovery of capillaries in the frog lung by Malpighi to the current use of single and multiphoton imaging of intravital and isolated perfused lung preparations incorporating fluorescent molecular probes and transgenic reporter mice. Along the way, much has been learned about the unique microcirculation of the lung, including immune cell migration and the mechanisms by which cells at the alveolar-capillary interface communicate with each other. In this review, we highlight live lung imaging techniques as applied to the role of mitochondria in lung immunity, mechanisms of signal transduction in lung compartments, studies on the composition of alveolar wall liquid, and neutrophil and platelet trafficking in the lung under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. New applications of live lung imaging and the limitations of current techniques are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells secrete surfactant that forms a protective layer on the lung's alveolar epithelium. Vesicles called lamellar bodies (LBs) store surfactant. Failure of surfactant secretion, which causes severe lung disease, relates to the manner in which LBs undergo exocytosis during the secretion. However, the dynamics of LBs during the secretion process are not known in intact alveoli. Here, we addressed this question through real-time confocal microscopy of single AT2 cells in live alveoli of mouse lungs. Using a combination of phospholipid and aqueous fluorophores that localize to LBs, we induced surfactant secretion by transiently hyperinflating the lung, and we quantified the secretion in terms of loss of bulk LB fluorescence. In addition, we quantified inter-LB phospholipid flow through determinations of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Furthermore, we determined the role of F-actin in surfactant secretion through expression of the fluorescent F-actin probe Lifeact. Our findings indicate that, in AT2 cells in situ, LBs are held in an F-actin scaffold. Although F-actin transiently decreases during surfactant secretion, the LBs remain stationary, forming a chain of vesicles connected by intervesicular channels that convey surfactant to the secretion site on the plasma membrane. This is the first instance of a secretory process in which the secretory vesicles are immobile, but form a conduit for the secretory material.",

        "Abstract": "Considerable progress has been made in understanding the basic mechanisms that regulate fluid and protein exchange across the endothelial and epithelial barriers of the lung under both normal and pathological conditions. Clinically relevant lung injury occurs most commonly from severe viral and bacterial infections, aspiration syndromes, and severe shock. The mechanisms of lung injury have been identified in both experimental and clinical studies. Recovery from lung injury requires the reestablishment of an intact endothelial barrier and a functional alveolar epithelial barrier capable of secreting surfactant and removing alveolar edema fluid. Repair mechanisms include the participation of endogenous progenitor cells in strategically located niches in the lung. Novel treatment strategies include the possibility of cell-based therapy that may reduce the severity of lung injury and enhance lung repair.",

        "Abstract": "When ventilation is blocked, the lung can protect against the loss of blood oxygenation by activating localized arterial vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow to underventilated regions, and redirecting flow to better-ventilated alveoli. This phenomenon, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), preserves the overall efficiency of blood oxygenation, but the mechanism by which the hypoxic signal is transmitted to the smooth muscle that contracts the arterioles has remained largely a mystery. In this issue of the JCI, Wang et al. reveal that the endothelial lining of the hypoxic alveoli plays a key role in sensing hypoxia and transmitting the signal to initiate HPV.",

        "Abstract": "The molecular basis of endothelial protein sieving, the critical vascular barrier function that restricts flow of large plasma proteins into tissues while allowing small molecules and water to pass, is not understood. Here, we address this issue using a novel assay to detect macromolecular penetrance at microdomains of endothelial adherens junctions. Adherens junctions, as detected by cadherin-GFP expression, were distributed in the cell perimeter as high- or low-density segments. Low but not high-density segments permitted penetrance of a 70-kDa fluorescent dextran, a molecule of equivalent size to albumin. Expression of a cadherin mutant that abrogates strand-swap adhesive binding in the cadherin EC1 ectodomain, or alternatively of an Î±-actinin-1 mutant that inhibits F-actin bundling, increased both cadherin mobility and 70 kDa dextran penetrance at high-density segments. These findings suggest that adhesive interactions in the cadherin EC1 domain, which underlie adherens junction structure, are critical determinants of endothelial macromolecular sieving.",

        "Abstract": "Although gastric acid aspiration causes rapid lung inflammation and acute lung injury, the initiating mechanisms are not known. To determine alveolar epithelial responses to acid, we viewed live alveoli of the isolated lung by fluorescence microscopy, then we microinjected the alveoli with HCl at pH of 1.5. The microinjection caused an immediate but transient formation of molecule-scale pores in the apical alveolar membrane, resulting in loss of cytosolic dye. However, the membrane rapidly resealed. There was no cell damage and no further dye loss despite continuous HCl injection. Concomitantly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased in the adjacent perialveolar microvascular endothelium in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. By contrast, ROS did not increase in wild-type mice in which we gave intra-alveolar injections of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-catalase, in mice overexpressing alveolar catalase, or in mice lacking functional NADPH oxidase (Nox2). Together, our findings indicate the presence of an unusual proinflammatory mechanism in which alveolar contact with acid caused membrane pore formation. The effect, although transient, was nevertheless sufficient to induce Ca(2+) entry and Nox2-dependent H(2)O(2) release from the alveolar epithelium. These responses identify alveolar H(2)O(2) release as the signaling mechanism responsible for lung inflammation induced by acid and suggest that intra-alveolar PEG-catalase might be therapeutic in acid-induced lung injury.",

        "Abstract": "Bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) protect against acute lung injury (ALI). To determine the role of BMSC mitochondria in this protection, we airway-instilled mice first with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then with either mouse BMSCs (mBMSCs) or human BMSCs (hBMSCs). Live optical studies revealed that the mBMSCs formed connexin 43 (Cx43)-containing gap junctional channels (GJCs) with the alveolar epithelia in these mice, releasing mitochondria-containing microvesicles that the epithelia engulfed. The presence of BMSC-derived mitochondria in the epithelia was evident optically, as well as by the presence of human mitochondrial DNA in mouse lungs instilled with hBMSCs. The mitochondrial transfer resulted in increased alveolar ATP concentrations. LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by alveolar leukocytosis and protein leak, inhibition of surfactant secretion and high mortality, was markedly abrogated by the instillation of wild-type mBMSCs but not of mutant, GJC-incompetent mBMSCs or mBMSCs with dysfunctional mitochondria. This is the first evidence, to our knowledge, that BMSCs protect against ALI by restituting alveolar bioenergetics through Cx43-dependent alveolar attachment and mitochondrial transfer.",

        "Abstract": "Acid aspiration is a major cause of acute lung injury. However, the mechanisms that underlie this spatial expansion of the injury remain undefined. In current animal models of acid injury, intratracheal acid instillation replicates the lung injury. However intratracheal instillation causes a global effect, precluding studies of how the injury spreads. Here, we report an airway catheter-based method for localized acid delivery in the isolated blood-perfused rat lung. We co-instilled hydrochloric acid with evans blue through the catheter into one lung and determined blood-free extravascular lung water in tissue samples from regions that either received, or did not receive the instilled acid. Tissue samples from the noncatheterized contralateral lung were used as controls. Lung water increased both in the regions that received acid, as well as in adjacent regions that did not. Pretreating the lung with vascular infusions of the gap junctional blocker, glycerrhetinic acid, blunted the acid-induced lung water increase at the adjacent regions. These findings indicate that endothelial gap junction communication causes spread of lung injury from regions that were directly acid injured, to adjacent sites that did not directly receive acid. Our new method for establishing localized acid injury provides evidence for a novel role for vascular gap junctions in the spatial expansion of acid injury.",

        "Abstract": "Shedding of the extracellular domain of cytokine receptors allows the diffusion of soluble receptors into the extracellular space; these then bind and neutralize their cytokine ligands, thus dampening inflammatory responses. The molecular mechanisms that control this process, and the extent to which shedding regulates cytokine-induced microvascular inflammation, are not well defined. Here, we used real-time confocal microscopy of mouse lung microvascular endothelium to demonstrate that mitochondria are key regulators of this process. The proinflammatory cytokine soluble TNF-Î± (sTNF-Î±) increased mitochondrial Ca2+, and the purinergic receptor P2Y2 prolonged the response. Concomitantly, the proinflammatory receptor TNF-Î± receptor-1 (TNFR1) was shed from the endothelial surface. Inhibiting the mitochondrial Ca2+ increase blocked the shedding and augmented inflammation, as denoted by increases in endothelial expression of the leukocyte adhesion receptor E-selectin and in microvascular leukocyte recruitment. The shedding was also blocked in microvessels after knockdown of a complex III component and after mitochondria-targeted catalase overexpression. Endothelial deletion of the TNF-Î± converting enzyme (TACE) prevented the TNF-Î± receptor shedding response, which suggests that exposure of microvascular endothelium to sTNF-Î± induced a Ca2+-dependent increase of mitochondrial H2O2 that caused TNFR1 shedding through TACE activation. These findings provide what we believe to be the first evidence that endothelial mitochondria regulate TNFR1 shedding and thereby determine the severity of sTNF-Î±-induced microvascular inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "The decrease of lung compliance in pulmonary edema underlies ventilator-induced lung injury. However, the cause of the decrease in compliance is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that in pulmonary edema, the mechanical effects of liquid-filled alveoli increase tissue stress in adjacent air-filled alveoli. By micropuncture of isolated, perfused rat lungs, we established a single-alveolus model of pulmonary edema that we imaged using confocal microscopy. In this model, we viewed a liquid-filled alveolus together with its air-filled neighbor at different transpulmonary pressures, both before and after liquid-filling. Instilling liquid in an alveolus caused alveolar shrinkage. As a result, the interalveolar septum was stretched, causing the neighboring air-filled alveolus to bulge. Thus, the air-filled alveolus was overexpanded by virtue of its adjacency to a liquid-filled alveolus. Confocal microscopy at different depths of the liquid-filled alveolus revealed a meniscus. Lung inflation to near-total lung capacity (TLC) demonstrated decreased compliance of the air-filled but not liquid-filled alveolus. However, at near TLC, the air-filled alveolus was larger than it was in the pre-edematous control tissue. In pulmonary edema, liquid-filled alveoli induce mechanical stress on air-filled alveoli, reducing the compliance of air-filled alveoli, and hence overall lung compliance. Because of increased mechanical stress, air-filled alveoli may be susceptible to overdistension injury during mechanical ventilation of the edematous lung.",

        "Abstract": "Although the vascular bed is a major source of nitric oxide (NO) production, factors regulating the production remain unclear. We considered the role played by paracrine signaling. Determinations by fluorescence microscopy in isolated, blood-perfused rat and mouse lungs revealed that a brief lung expansion enhanced cytosolic Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)cyt) oscillations in alveolar epithelial (AEC) and endothelial (EC) cells, and NO production in EC. Furthermore, as assessed by a novel microlavage assay, alveolar ATP production increased. Intra-alveolar microinfusion of the purinergic receptor antagonist, PPADS, and the nucleotide hydrolyzing enzyme, apyrase, each completely blocked the Ca(2+)cyt and NO responses in EC. Lung expansion induced Ca(2+)cyt oscillations in mice lacking the P2Y1, but not the P2Y2, purinergic receptors, which were located in the perivascular interstitium basolateral to AEC. Prolonged lung expansion instituted by mechanical ventilation at high tidal volume increased EC expression of nitrotyrosine, indicating development of nitrosative stress in lung microvessels. These findings reveal a novel mechanism in which mechanically induced purinergic signaling couples cross-compartmental Ca(2+)cyt oscillations to microvascular NO production.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions between MSCs and host cells, in particular endothelial cells (ECs), remain unclear. We show here in a matrigel angiogenesis assay that MSCs are capable of inhibiting capillary growth. After addition of MSCs to EC-derived capillaries in matrigel at EC:MSC ratio of 1:1, MSCs migrated toward the capillaries, intercalated between ECs, established Cx43-based intercellular gap junctional communication (GJC) with ECs, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These events led to EC apoptosis and capillary degeneration. In an in vivo tumor model, direct MSC inoculation into subcutaneous melanomas induced apoptosis and abrogated tumor growth. Thus, our findings show for the first time that at high numbers, MSCs are potentially cytotoxic and that when injected locally in tumor tissue they might be effective antiangiogenesis agents suitable for cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "To understand the connection between alveolar mechanics and key biochemical events such as surfactant secretion, one first needs to characterize the underlying mechanical properties of the lung parenchyma and its cellular constituents. In this study, the mechanics of three major cell types from the neonatal rat lung were studied; primary alveolar type I (AT1) and type II (AT2) epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts were isolated using enzymatic digestion. Atomic force microscopy indentation was used to map the three-dimensional distribution of apparent depth-dependent pointwise elastic modulus. Histograms of apparent modulus data from all three cell types indicated non-Gaussian distributions that were highly skewed and appeared multimodal for AT2 cells and fibroblasts. Nuclear stiffness in all three cell types was similar (2.5+/-1.0 kPa in AT1 vs. 3.1+/-1.5 kPa in AT2 vs. 3.3+/-0.8 kPa in fibroblasts; n=10 each), whereas cytoplasmic moduli were significantly higher in fibroblasts and AT2 cells (6.0+/-2.3 and 4.7+/-2.9 kPa vs. 2.5+/-1.2 kPa). In both epithelial cell types, actin was arranged in sparse clusters, whereas prominent actin stress fibers were observed in lung fibroblasts. No systematic difference in actin or microtubule organization was noted between AT1 and AT2 cells. Atomic force microscope elastography, combined with live-cell fluorescence imaging, revealed that the stiffer measurements in AT2 cells often colocalized with lamellar bodies. These findings partially explain reported heterogeneity of alveolar cell deformation during in situ lung inflation and provide needed data for better understanding of how mechanical stretch influences surfactant release.",

Here we report that red blood cells (RBCs) induce hypoxic inflammation by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that diffuse to endothelial cells of adjoining blood vessels. Real-time fluorescence imaging of rat and mouse lungs revealed that in the presence of RBC-containing vascular perfusion, hypoxia increased microvascular ROS, and cytosolic Ca(2+), leading to P-selectin-dependent leukocyte recruitment. However, in the presence of RBC-free perfusion, all hypoxia-induced responses were completely inhibited. Because hemoglobin (Hb) autoxidation causes RBC superoxide formation that readily dismutates to H(2)O(2), hypoxia-induced responses were lost when we inhibited Hb autoxidation with CO or nitrite, or when the H(2)O(2) inhibitor, catalase was added to the infusion to neutralize the RBC-derived ROS. By contrast, perfusion with RBCs from BERK-trait mice that are more susceptible to Hb autoxidation and to hypoxia-induced superoxide production enhanced the hypoxia-induced responses. We conclude that in hypoxia, increased Hb autoxidation augments superoxide production in RBCs. Consequently, RBCs release H(2)O(2) that diffuses to the lung microvascular endothelium, thereby initiating Ca(2+)-dependent leukocyte recruitment. These findings are the first evidence that RBCs contribute to hypoxia-induced inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "During lung expansion, the pattern of alveolar perimeter distension is likely to be an important determinant of lung functions as, for example, surfactant secretion. However, the segmental characteristics of alveolar perimeter distension remain unknown. Here, we applied real-time confocal microscopy in the isolated, perfused rat lung to determine the micromechanics of alveolar perimeter distension. To image the alveolar perimeter, we loaded alveolar epithelial cells with a fluorescent dye that we microinjected into the alveolus. Then we viewed single alveoli in a 2-microm-thick optical section at a focal plane 20 mum deep to the pleural surface at baseline. In each alveolus, we identified five to eight segments of the perimeter. For each segment, we determined length (L(seg)) by means of image analysis. At baseline alveolar pressure (P(alv)) of 5 cmH(2)O, L(seg) averaged 46 microm. We hyperinflated the lung to P(alv) of 20 cmH(2)O and identified the same optical section as referenced against morphological landmarks. Hyperinflation increased mean L(seg) by 14%. However, segment distension was heterogeneous, even within the single alveolus. Furthermore, distension was greater in alveolar type 1 than type 2 epithelial cells. These findings indicate that alveoli expand nonuniformly, suggesting that segments that distend the most might be preferred alveolar locations for injury in conditions associated with lung overdistension.",

        "Abstract": "The liquid layer lining the pulmonary alveolar wall critically determines the lung's immune defense against inhaled pathogens, because it provides a liquid milieu in the air-filled alveolus for dispersal of immune cells and defensive surfactant proteins. However, mechanisms underlying formation of the liquid are unknown. We achieved visualization of the alveolar wall liquid (AWL) in situ in mouse lungs by means of optical-sectioning microscopy. Continuous liquid secretion was present in alveoli of wild-type (WT) mice under baseline conditions. This secretion was blocked by inhibitors of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The secretion was absent in Cftr(-/-) mice, and it was blocked when chloride was depleted from the perfusate of WT mice, providing the first evidence that CFTR-dependent chloride secretion causes AWL formation. Injected microparticles demonstrated flow of the AWL. The flow was blocked by CFTR inhibition and was absent in Cftr(-/-) mice. We conclude that CFTR-dependent liquid secretion is present in alveoli of the adult mouse. Defective alveolar secretion might impair alveolar immune defense and promote alveolar disease.",

        "Abstract": "Although proinflammatory cell signaling in the alveolo-capillary region predisposes to acute lung injury, key cell-signaling mechanisms remain inadequately understood. Alveolo-capillary inflammation is likely to involve coordinated signaling among cells of different phenotypes. For example, migration of inflammatory cells into the alveolus might entail coordinated signaling between adjoining alveolar epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells. The popular cultured cell experimental strategy fails to replicate this multicellular environment. Cultured lung cells, both alveolar and endothelial, undergo phenotypic transformations; hence they might inadequately reflect innate responses of native cells. Consequently, new approaches are required for the investigation of cell signaling in the native setting. Here we summarize new developments in classical intravital microscopy and discuss real-time fluorescence imaging as a novel technique for studying second-messenger mechanisms in the alveolo-capillary region.",

        "Abstract": "Endothelial cell (EC) junctions determine vascular barrier properties and are subject to transient opening to allow liquid flux from blood to tissue. Although EC junctions open in the presence of permeability-enhancing factors, including oxidants, the mechanisms by which they reseal remain inadequately understood. To model opening and resealing of EC junctions in the presence of an oxidant, we quantified changes in H(2)O(2)-induced transendothelial resistance (TER) in monolayers of rat lung microvascular EC. During a 30-min exposure, H(2)O(2) (100 microM) decreased TER for an initial approximately 10 min, indicating junctional opening. Subsequently, despite continuous presence of H(2)O(2), TER recovered to baseline, indicating the activation of junctional resealing mechanisms. These bimodal TER transients matched the time course of loss and then gain of E-cadherin at EC junctions. The timing of the TER decrease matched the onset of focal adhesion formation, while F-actin increase at the cell periphery occurred with a time course that complemented the recovery of peripheral E-cadherin. In monolayers expressing a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mutant (del-FAK) that inhibits FAK activity, the initial H(2)O(2)-induced junctional opening was present, although the subsequent junctional recovery was blocked. Expression of transfected E-cadherin was evident at the cell periphery of wild-type but not del-FAK-expressing EC. E-cadherin overexpression in del-FAK-expressing EC failed to effect major rescue of the junctional resealing response. These findings indicate that in oxidant-induced EC junction opening, FAK plays a critical role in remodeling the adherens junction to reseal the barrier.",

        "Abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI), which is associated with a mortality of 30-40%, is attributable to inflammation that develops rapidly across the lung's vast vascular surface, involving an entire lung or even both lungs. No specific mechanism explains this extensive inflammatory spread, probably because of the lack of approaches for detecting signal conduction in lung capillaries. Here, we addressed this question by applying the photolytic uncaging approach to induce focal increases in Ca2+ levels in targeted endothelial cells of alveolar capillaries. Uncaging caused Ca2+ levels to increase not only in the targeted cell, but also in vascular locations up to 150 microm from the target site, indicating that Ca2+ was conducted from the capillary to adjacent vessels. No such conduction was evident in mouse lungs lacking endothelial connexin 43 (Cx43), or in rat lungs in which we pretreated vessels with peptide inhibitors of Cx43. These findings provide the first direct evidence to our knowledge that interendothelial Ca2+ conduction occurs in the lung capillary bed and that Cx43-containing gap junctions mediate the conduction. A proinflammatory effect was evident in that induction of increases in Ca2+ levels in the capillary activated expression of the leukocyte adherence receptor P-selectin in venules. Further, peptide inhibitors of Cx43 completely blocked thrombin-induced microvascular permeability increases. Together, our findings reveal a novel role for Cx43-mediated gap junctions, namely as conduits for the spread of proinflammatory signals in the lung capillary bed. Gap junctional mechanisms require further consideration in the understanding of ALI.",

        "Title": "Lung surfactant secretion by interalveolar Ca2+ signaling.",
        "Abstract": "Although clusters of alveoli form the acinus, which is the most distal respiratory unit, it is not known whether interalveolar communication coordinates acinar surfactant secretion. To address this, we applied real-time digital imaging in conjunction with photo-excited Ca2+ uncaging in intact alveoli of the isolated, blood-perfused rat lung. We loaded alveolar cells with the Ca2+ cage o-nitrophenyl EGTA-AM (NP-EGTA-AM) together with the fluorophores, fluo 4, or LysoTracker green (LTG) to determine, respectively, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) or type 2 cell secretion. To uncage Ca2+ from NP-EGTA, we exposed a region in a selected alveolus to high-intensity UV illumination. As a result, fluo 4 fluorescence increased, whereas LTG fluorescence decreased, in the photo-targeted region, indicating that uncaging both increased [Ca2+]cyt and induced secretion. Concomitantly, [Ca2+]cyt increases conducted from the uncaging site induced type 2 cell secretion in both the selected alveolus as well as in neighboring alveoli, indicating the presence of interalveolar communication. These conducted responses were inhibited by pretreating alveoli with the connexin43 (Cx43)-inhibiting peptides gap 26 and gap 27. However, although the conducted [Ca2+]cyt increase diminished with distance from the uncaging site, type 2 cell secretion rates were similar at all locations. We conclude that Cx43-dependent, interalveolar Ca2+ signals regulate type 2 cell secretion in adjacent alveoli. Such interalveolar communication might facilitate acinar coordination of alveolar function.",

        "Abstract": "The symposium addressed the burgeoning interest in fundamental mechanisms underlying the onset of pneumonia. Bacteria exploit the lung's innate immune mechanism, resulting in pathophysiological cell signaling. As a consequence inflammation develops, leading to pneumonia. New mechanisms have been identified by which bacteria or bacterial products in the airway induce cross-compartmental signaling that leads to inflammatory consequences. The speakers addressed activation of the transcription factor, NF-kappaB occurring as a consequence of bacterial interactions with specific receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors and the TNF receptor 1 (Prince), or as a consequence of cytokine induction (Mizgerd). Also considered were mechanisms of bacterial virulence in the clinical setting (Wiener-Kronish) and the role of alveolar-capillary signaling mechanisms in the initiation of lung inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Although pressure elevation in lung postcapillary venules increases endothelial P-selectin expression, the extent to which P-selectin causes lung leukocyte margination remains controversial. To address this issue, we optically viewed postcapillary venules of the isolated blood-perfused rat lung by real-time fluorescence imaging. To determine leukocyte margination in single postcapillary venules, we quantified the fluorescence of leukocytes labeled in situ with rhodamine 6G (R6G). Although baseline fluorescence was sparse, a 10-min pressure elevation by 10 cmH(2)O markedly increased R6G fluorescence. Both stopping blood flow during pressure elevation and eliminating leukocytes from the perfusion blocked the fluorescence increase, affirming that these fluorescence responses were attributable to pressure-induced leukocyte margination. A P-selectin-blocking MAb and the L- and P-selectin blocker fucoidin each inhibited the fluorescence increase, indicating that P-selectin was critical for inducing margination. Time-dependent imaging of blood-borne fluorescent beads revealed reduction of plasma velocity during pressure elevation. After pressure returned to baseline, a similar reduction of plasma velocity, established by manually decreasing the perfusion rate, prolonged margination. Our findings show that in lung postcapillary venules, the decrease in plasma velocity critically determines pressure-induced leukocyte margination.",

        "Abstract": "Pathogenesis of the abdominal aortic aneurysm has been attributed to neovascularization of the aortic wall. However, it is not clear whether angiogenesis persists in the aneurysm. In sections of aneurysms, we determined the immunohistochemical distributions of the avb3 integrin, tenascin and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which are markers respectively, of angiogenesis, matrix remodeling and vasoregulatory function. In addition, we used reverse transcription followed by in situ PCR, to determine the distribution of av mRNA. All aneurysm specimens exhibited extensive increases of wall vascularization as compared with the control aortic wall, and showed the presence of perivascular inflammatory exudates containing macrophages and lymphocytes. The neovascularization consisted of thick-walled vessels in the media and adventitia, and capillaries in the subintima. The majority of vessels stained positively for the avb3 antigen and eNOS. Tenascin was deposited as bands that circumscribed thick-walled vessels. The distribution of av mRNA was extensive and was positive even in those vessels that failed to stain for the avb3 protein. No staining was evident in control aortas for the avb3 antigen, tenascin or av mRNA. The upregulation of av mRNA and the avb3 integrin in blood vessels surrounded by a matrix expressing tenascin, indicates that angiogenesis is an ongoing process in the mature aortic aneurysm.",

        "Abstract": "This review summarizes the highlights of the EB2004 symposium that dealt with the integrated aspects of the lung fluid balance. It is apparent that maintenance of lung fluid balance requires the proper functioning of vascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial barriers. Under physiological conditions, the transcytotic pathway requiring repeated fission-fusion events of the caveolar membrane with other caveolae solely transports albumin. Caveolin-1, which forms caveolae, and albumin-binding proteins play a central role in signaling the transcytosis of albumin. Signals responsible for increasing endothelial permeability in lung microvessels in response to inflammatory mediators were also described. These studies in gene knockout mouse models revealed the importance of Ca(2+) signaling via store-operated transient receptor channel 4 and the activation of endothelial myosin light chain kinase isoform in mediating the increase in microvessel permeability. Increases in the cytosolic Ca(2+) in situ in microvessel endothelia can occur by mitochondria-dependent as well as mitochondria-independent pathways (such as the endoplasmic reticulum). Both these pathways, by triggering endothelial cell activation, may result in lung microvascular injury. The resolution of alveolar edema, requiring clearance of fluid from the air space, is another area of intense investigation in animal models. Although beta-adrenergic agonists can activate alveolar fluid clearance, signaling pathways regulating these events in intact alveoli remain to be established. Development of mouse models in which the function of regulatory proteins (identified in cell culture studies) can be systematically analyzed will provide a better and more integrated picture of lung fluid balance.

        "Abstract": "Although capillary barrier deterioration underlies major inflammatory lung pathology, barrier-enhancing strategies are not available. To consider hyperosmolar therapy as a possible strategy, we gave 15-minute infusions of hyperosmolar sucrose in lung venular capillaries imaged in real time. Surprisingly, this treatment enhanced the capillary barrier, as indicated by quantification of the capillary hydraulic conductivity. The barrier enhancement was sufficient to block the injurious effects of thrombin, TNF-alpha, and H2O2 in single capillaries, and of intratracheal acid instillation in the whole lung. Capillary immunofluorescence indicated that the hyperosmolar infusion markedly augmented actin filament formation and E-cadherin expression at the endothelial cell periphery. The actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin B abrogated the hyperosmolar barrier enhancement as well as the actin filament formation, suggesting a role for actin in the barrier response. Furthermore, hyperosmolar infusion blocked TNF-alpha-induced P-selectin expression in an actin-dependent manner. Our results provide the first evidence to our knowledge that in lung capillaries, hyperosmolarity remodels the endothelial barrier and the actin cytoskeleton to enhance barrier properties and block proinflammatory secretory processes. Hyperosmolar therapy may be beneficial in lung inflammatory disease.",

        "Abstract": "Elevation of lung capillary pressure causes exocytosis of the leukocyte adhesion receptor P-selectin in endothelial cells (ECs), indicating that lung ECs generate a proinflammatory response to pressure-induced stress. To define underlying mechanisms, we followed the EC signaling sequence leading to P-selectin exocytosis through application of real-time, in situ fluorescence microscopy in lung capillaries. Pressure elevation increased the amplitude of cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations that triggered increases in the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca(2+) oscillations and in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Responses to blockers of the Ca(2+) oscillations and of mitochondrial electron transport indicated that the ROS production was Ca(2+) dependent and of mitochondrial origin. A new proinflammatory mechanism was revealed in that pressure-induced exocytosis of P-selectin was inhibited by both antioxidants and mitochondrial inhibitors, indicating that the exocytosis was driven by mitochondrial ROS. In this signaling pathway mitochondria coupled pressure-induced Ca(2+) oscillations to the production of ROS that in turn acted as diffusible messengers to activate P-selectin exocytosis. These findings implicate mitochondrial mechanisms in the lung's proinflammatory response to pressure elevation and identify mitochondrial ROS as critical to P-selectin exocytosis in lung capillary ECs.",

        "Abstract": "Endothelial cell barrier (EC) properties regulate blood tissue fluid flux. To determine the role of endothelial-matrix interactions in barrier regulation, we induced cell shrinkage by exposing confluent endothelial monolayers to hyperosmolarity. The dominant effect of a 15-min hyperosmolar exposure was an increase in the trans-endothelial electrical resistance, indicating the induction of barrier strengthening. Hyperosmolar exposure also increased activity of focal adhesion kinase and E-cadherin accumulation at the cell periphery. Concomitantly, the density of actin filaments increased markedly. In EC monolayers stably expressing constitutively active or dominant negative isoforms of Rac1, the actin response to hyperosmolar exposure was enhanced or blocked, respectively, although the response in trans-endothelial resistance was unaffected, indicating that the endothelial barrier enhancement occurred independently of actin. However, in monolayers expressing a kinase-deficient mutant of focal adhesion kinase, the hyperosmolarity-induced increases in activity of focal adhesion and peripheral E-cadherin enhancement were blocked and the induced increase of electrical resistance was markedly blunted. These findings indicate that in EC exposed to hyperosmolar challenge, the involvement of focal adhesion kinase was critical in establishing barrier strengthening.",

        "Abstract": "Alveolar overdistension during mechanical ventilation causes leukocyte sequestration, leading to lung injury. However, underlying endothelial cell (EC) mechanisms are undefined. In a new approach, we exposed isolated blood-perfused rat lungs to high tidal volume ventilation (HV) for 2 h, then obtained fresh lung endothelial cells (FLEC) by immunosorting at 4 degrees C. Immunoblotting experiments indicated that as compared with FLEC derived from lungs ventilated at low volume (LV), HV markedly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation (TyrP). The tyrosine kinase blocker, genistein, inhibited this response. HV also induced focal adhesion (FA) formation in FLEC, as detected by immunofluorescent aggregates of the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin that co-localized with aggregations of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Immunoprecipitation and blotting experiments revealed that HV increased TyrP of the FA protein, paxillin. In addition, HV induced a paxillin-associated P-selectin expression on FLEC that was also inhibited by genistein. However, HV did not increase lung water. These results indicate that in HV, EC signaling in situ causes FA formation and induces TyrP-dependent P-selectin expression. These signaling mechanisms may promote leukocyte-mediated responses in HV.",

To understand the early EC signaling that induces the expression, we conducted real-time digital imaging studies in lung venular capillaries. To compare receptor- vs nonreceptor-mediated effects, we infused capillaries with respectively, TNF-alpha and arachidonate. At concentrations adjusted to give equipotent increases in the cytosolic Ca(2+), both agents increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and EC P-selectin expression. Blocking the cytosolic Ca(2+) increases abolished ROS production; blocking ROS production abrogated P-selectin expression. TNF-alpha, but not arachidonate, released Ca(2+) from endoplasmic stores and increased mitochondrial Ca(2+). Furthermore, Ca(2+) depletion abrogated TNF-alpha responses partially, but arachidonate responses completely. These differences in Ca(2+) mobilization by TNF-alpha and arachidonate were reflected in spatial patterning in the capillary in that the TNF-alpha effects were localized at branch points, while the arachidonate effects were nonlocalized and extensive. Furthermore, mitochondrial blockers inhibited the TNF-alpha- but not the arachidonate-induced responses. These findings indicate that the different modes of Ca(2+) mobilization determined the spatial patterning of the proinflammatory response in lung capillaries. Responses to TNF-alpha revealed that EC mitochondria regulate the proinflammatory process by generating ROS that activate P-selectin expression.",

In lung venular capillaries, we determined endothelial cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration [Ca(2+)](i) by the fura 2 ratioing method. Pressure elevation increased mean endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) by Ca(2+) influx through gadolinium-inhibitable channels and amplified [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations by Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) transients were induced by pressure elevations of as little as 5 cmH(2)O and increased linearly with higher pressures. Heptanol inhibition of [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in a subset of endothelial cells indicated that oscillations originated from pacemaker endothelial cells and were propagated to adjacent nonpacemaker cells by gap junctional communication. Our findings indicate the presence of a sensitive, active endothelial response to pressure challenge in lung venular capillaries that may be relevant in the pathogenesis of pressure-induced lung microvascular injury.",
