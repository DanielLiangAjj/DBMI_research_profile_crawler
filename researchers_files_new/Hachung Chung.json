        "Title": "The Sixth Sense: Self-nucleic acid sensing in the brain.",
        "Abstract": "Our innate immune system uses pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) as a first line of defense to detect microbial ligands and initiate an immune response. Viral nucleic acids are key ligands for the activation of many PRRs and the induction of downstream inflammatory and antiviral effects. Initially it was thought that endogenous (self) nucleic acids rarely activated these PRRs, however emerging evidence indicates that endogenous nucleic acids are able to activate host PRRs in homeostasis and disease. In fact, many regulatory mechanisms are in place to finely control and regulate sensing of self-nucleic acids by PRRs. Sensing of self-nucleic acids is particularly important in the brain, as perturbations to nucleic acid sensing commonly leads to neuropathology. This review will highlight the role of nucleic acid sensors in the brain, both in disease and homeostasis. We also indicate the source of endogenous stimulatory nucleic acids where known and summarize future directions for the study of this growing field.",

ADAR1 is the primary A-to-I editor of RNA in humans, and the majority of edit sites are found in a class of short interspersed nuclear elements called Alu elements, many of which are located in introns and 3' untranslated regions. Two ADAR1 protein isoforms, p110 (110 kDa) and p150 (150 kDa), are known to be coupled in expression, and decoupling the expression of these isoforms has revealed that the p150 isoform edits a broader range of targets compared to p110. Numerous methods for identification of ADAR1-associated edits have been developed, and we present here a specific method for identification of edit sites associated with individual ADAR1 isoforms.",

Paralleling protein turnover by the proteasome complex, lncRNAs are also likely to exist in a dynamic equilibrium that is maintained through constant monitoring by the RNA surveillance machinery. In this Review, we describe the RNA surveillance factors and discuss the vital role of lncRNA surveillance in orchestrating various biological processes, including the protection of genome integrity, maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, antibody-gene diversification, coordination of immune cell activation and regulation of heterochromatin formation. We also discuss examples of human diseases and developmental defects associated with the failure of RNA surveillance mechanisms, further highlighting the importance of lncRNA surveillance in maintaining cell and organism functions and health.",

        "Abstract": "Type I interferon (IFN) is produced when host sensors detect foreign nucleic acids, but how sensors differentiate self from nonself nucleic acids, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), is incompletely understood. Mutations in ADAR1, an adenosine-to-inosine editing enzyme of dsRNA, cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, an autoinflammatory disorder associated with spontaneous interferon production and neurologic sequelae. We generated ADAR1 knockout human cells to explore ADAR1 substrates and function. ADAR1 primarily edited Alu elements in RNA polymerase II (pol II)-transcribed mRNAs, but not putative pol III-transcribed Alus. During the IFN response, ADAR1 blocked translational shutdown by inhibiting hyperactivation of PKR, a dsRNA sensor. ADAR1 dsRNA binding and catalytic activities were required to fully prevent endogenous RNA from activating PKR. Remarkably, ADAR1 knockout neuronal progenitor cells exhibited MDA5 (dsRNA sensor)-dependent spontaneous interferon production, PKR activation, and cell death. Thus, human ADAR1 regulates sensing of self versus nonself RNA, allowing pathogen detection while avoiding autoinflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Gut microbial induction of host immune maturation exemplifies host-microbe mutualism. We colonized germ-free (GF) mice with mouse microbiota (MMb) or human microbiota (HMb) to determine whether small intestinal immune maturation depends on a coevolved host-specific microbiota. Gut bacterial numbers and phylum abundance were similar in MMb and HMb mice, but bacterial species differed, especially the Firmicutes. HMb mouse intestines had low levels of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, few proliferating T cells, few dendritic cells, and low antimicrobial peptide expression--all characteristics of GF mice. Rat microbiota also failed to fully expand intestinal T cell numbers in mice. Colonizing GF or HMb mice with mouse-segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) partially restored T cell numbers, suggesting that SFB and other MMb organisms are required for full immune maturation in mice. Importantly, MMb conferred better protection against Salmonella infection than HMb. A host-specific microbiota appears to be critical for a healthy immune system.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years there has been an explosion of interest to identify microbial inhabitants of human and understand their beneficial role in health. In the gut, a symbiotic host-microbial interaction has coevolved as bacteria make essential contributions to human metabolism and bacteria in turn benefits from the nutrient-rich niche in the intestine. To maintain host-microbe coexistence, the host must protect itself against microbial invasion, injury, and overreactions to foreign food antigens, and gut microbes need protection against competing microbes and the host immune system. Perturbation of this homeostatic coexistence has been strongly associated with human disease. This review discusses how gut bacteria regulate host innate and adaptive immunity, with emphasis on how this regulation contributes to host-microbe homeostasis in the gut.",

        "Abstract": "IL-17 cytokine production by the Th17 T cell subset is regulated by intestinal commmensals. We show that microbial colonization also regulates innate IL-17 production. A population of CD62L(-) gamma/delta T cells, in particular a lineage expressing the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1), can be quickly activated by microbes to produce IL-17. Antibiotic treatment and monocolonization of mice suggest that specific commensals-but not metronidazole-sensitive anaerobes like Bacteroides species-are required for maintaining IL-1R1(+) gamma/delta T cells. Signaling through the guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV1, but not through Toll-like receptors or antigen presentation pathways, is essential for inducing IL-1R1(+) gamma/delta T cells. Furthermore, IL-1R1(+) gamma/delta T cells are a potential source of IL-17 that can be activated by IL-23 and IL-1 in both infectious and noninfectious settings in vitro and in vivo. Thus, commensals orchestrate the expansion of phenotypically distinct gammadelta T cells, and innate immunity is a three-way interaction between host, pathogens, and microbiota.",

        "Abstract": "YopB is a 401-amino-acid protein that is secreted by a plasmid-encoded type III secretion system in pathogenic Yersinia species. YopB is required for Yersinia spp. to translocate across the host plasma membrane a set of secreted effector proteins that function to counteract immune signaling responses and to induce apoptosis. YopB contains two predicted transmembrane helices (residues 166 to 188 and 228 to 250) that are thought to insert into the host plasma membrane during translocation. YopB is also required for pore formation and host-cell-signaling responses to the type III machinery, and these functions of YopB may also require membrane insertion. To elucidate the importance of membrane insertion for YopB function, YopB proteins containing helix-disrupting double consecutive proline substitutions in the center of each transmembrane domain were constructed. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains expressing the mutant YopB proteins were used to infect macrophages or epithelial cells. Effector translocation, pore formation, and host-cell-signaling responses were studied. Introduction of helix-disrupting substitutions into the second transmembrane domain of YopB resulted in a nonfunctional protein that was not secreted by the type III machinery. Introduction of helix-disrupting substitutions into the first transmembrane domain of YopB resulted in a protein that was fully functional for secretion and for interaction with YopD, another component of the translocation machinery. However, the YopB protein with helix-disrupting substitutions in the first transmembrane domain was partially defective for translocation, pore formation, and signaling, suggesting that all three functions of YopB involve insertion into host membrane.",
