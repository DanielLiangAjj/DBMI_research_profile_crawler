        "Abstract": "Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) gene variations are linked to the development of numerous cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The lack of typical drug-binding sites has long hampered the discovery of therapeutic drugs targeting KRAS. Since \"CodeBreaK 100\" demonstrated Sotorasib's early safety and efficacy and led to its approval, especially in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the subsequent identification of specific inhibitors for the p.G12C mutation has offered hope. However, the CodeBreaK 200 study found no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between patients treated with Docetaxel and Sotorasib (AMG 510), adding another degree of complexity to this ongoing challenge. The current study compares the three-dimensional structures of the two major KRAS isoforms, KRAS4A and KRAS4B. It also investigates the probable structural changes caused by the three major mutations (p.G12C, p.G12D, and p.G12V) within Sotorasib's pocket domain. The computational analysis demonstrates that the wild-type and mutant isoforms have distinct aggregation propensities, resulting in the creation of alternate oligomeric configurations. This study highlights the increased complexity of the biological issue of using KRAS as a therapeutic target. The present study stresses the need for a better understanding of the structural dynamics of KRAS and its mutations to design more effective therapeutic approaches. It also emphasizes the potential of computational approaches to shed light on the complicated molecular pathways that drive KRAS-mediated oncogenesis. This study adds to the ongoing efforts to address the therapeutic hurdles presented by KRAS in cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "The early steps of viral infection involve protein complexes and structural lipid rearrangements which characterize the peculiar strategies of each virus to invade permissive host cells. Members of the human immune-related interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family have been described as inhibitors of the entry of a broad range of viruses into the host cells. Recently, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 is able to hijack IFITM2 for efficient infection. Here, we report the characterization of a newly generated specific anti-IFITM2 mAb able to impair Spike-mediated internalization of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells and, consequently, to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effects and syncytia formation. Furthermore, the anti-IFITM2 mAb reduced HSVs- and RSV-dependent cytopathic effects, suggesting that the IFITM2-mediated mechanism of host cell invasion might be shared with other viruses besides SARS-CoV-2. These results show the specific role of IFITM2 in mediating viral entry into the host cell and its candidacy as a cell target for antiviral therapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Patients affected with gliomas develop a complex set of clinical manifestations that deeply impact on quality of life and overall survival. Brain tumor-related epilepsy is frequently the first manifestation of gliomas or may occur during the course of disease; the underlying mechanisms have not been fully explained and depend on both patient and tumor factors. Novel treatment options derive from the growing use of third-generation antiepileptic drugs. Vasogenic edema and elevated intracranial pressure cause a considerable burden of symptoms, especially in high-grade glioma, requiring an adequate use of corticosteroids. Patients with gliomas present with an elevated risk of tumor-associated venous thromboembolism whose prophylaxis and treatment are challenging, considering also the availability of new oral anticoagulant drugs. Moreover, intracerebral hemorrhages can complicate the course of the illness both due to tumor-specific characteristics, patient comorbidities, and side effects of antithrombotic and antitumoral therapies. This paper aims to review recent advances in these clinical issues, discussing the medical management of gliomas through an updated literature review.",

Pharmacovigilance is the field of science that monitors, detects, and prevents adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Safety efforts begin during the development process, using in vivo and in vitro studies, continue through clinical trials, and extend to postmarketing surveillance of ADRs in real-world populations. Future toxicity and safety challenges, including increased polypharmacy and patient diversity, stress the limits of these traditional tools. Massive amounts of newly available data present an opportunity for using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve drug safety science. Here, we explore recent advances as applied to preclinical drug safety and postmarketing surveillance with a specific focus on machine and deep learning (DL) approaches.",

Here, we used complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafting to generate a humanized version of the anti-BAG3 antibody that may be further developed for possible clinical use. We show that the humanized anti-BAG3 antibody, named BAG3-H2L4, abrogates BAG3 binding to macrophages and subsequent release of IL-6. Furthermore, it specifically localizes into tumor tissues and significantly inhibits the growth of Mia PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell xenografts. We propose BAG3-H2L4 antibody as a potential clinical candidate for BAG3-targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer.",

        "Abstract": "For the past decade, the focus of complex disease research has been the genotype. From technological advancements to the development of analysis methods, great progress has been made. However, advances in our definition of the phenotype have remained stagnant. Phenotype characterization has recently emerged as an exciting area of informatics and machine learning. The copious amounts of diverse biomedical data that have been collected may be leveraged with data-driven approaches to elucidate trait-related features and patterns. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the phenotype in traditional genetic associations and the challenges this has imposed.Approaches for phenotype refinement that can aid in more accurate characterization of traits are also discussed. Further, the authors highlight promising machine learning approaches for establishing a phenotype and the challenges of electronic health record (EHR)-derived data. Expert commentary: The authors hypothesize that through unsupervised machine learning, data-driven approaches can be used to define phenotypes rather than relying on expert clinician knowledge. Through the use of machine learning and an unbiased set of features extracted from clinical repositories, researchers will have the potential to further understand complex traits and identify patient subgroups. This knowledge may lead to more preventative and precise clinical care.",

        "Abstract": "The analysis of large biomedical data often presents with various challenges related to not just the size of the data, but also to data quality issues such as heterogeneity, multidimensionality, noisiness, and incompleteness of the data. The data-intensive nature of computational genomics problems in biomedical informatics warrants the development and use of massive computer infrastructure and advanced software tools and platforms, including but not limited to the use of cloud computing. Our session aims to address these challenges in handling big data for designing a study, performing analysis, and interpreting outcomes of these analyses. These challenges have been prevalent in many studies including those which focus on the identification of novel genetic variant-phenotype associations using data from sources like Electronic Health Records (EHRs) or multi-omic data. One of the biggest challenges to focus on is the imperfect nature of the biomedical data where a lot of noise and sparseness is observed. In our session, we will present research articles that can help in identifying innovative ways to recognize and overcome newly arising challenges associated with pattern recognition in biomedical data.",

        "Abstract": "BAG3 is a multifunctional protein that can bind to heat shock proteins (Hsp) 70 through its BAG domain and to other partners through its WW domain, proline-rich (PXXP) repeat and IPV (Ile-Pro-Val) motifs. Its intracellular expression can be induced by stressful stimuli, while is constitutive in skeletal muscle, cardiac myocytes and several tumour types. BAG3 can modulate the levels, localisation or activity of its partner proteins, thereby regulating major cell pathways and functions, including apoptosis, autophagy, mechanotransduction, cytoskeleton organisation, motility. A secreted form of BAG3 has been identified in studies on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Secreted BAG3 can bind to a specific receptor, IFITM2, expressed on macrophages, and induce the release of factors that sustain tumour growth and the metastatic process. BAG3 neutralisation therefore appears to constitute a novel potential strategy in the therapy of PDAC and, possibly, other tumours.",

        "Abstract": "We performed a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) to identify interrelationships between the immune system genetic architecture and a wide array of phenotypes from two de-identified electronic health record (EHR) biorepositories. We selected variants within genes encoding critical factors in the immune system and variants with known associations with autoimmunity. To define case/control status for EHR diagnoses, we used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes from 3,024 Geisinger Clinic MyCode® subjects (470 diagnoses) and 2,899 Vanderbilt University Medical Center BioVU biorepository subjects (380 diagnoses). A pooled-analysis was also carried out for the replicating results of the two data sets. We identified new associations with potential biological relevance including SNPs in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and ankyrin-related genes associated with acute and chronic sinusitis and acute respiratory tract infection. The two most significant associations identified were for the C6orf10 SNP rs6910071 and \"rheumatoid arthritis\" (ICD-9 code category 714) (pMETAL = 2.58 x 10-9) and the ATN1 SNP rs2239167 and \"diabetes mellitus, type 2\" (ICD-9 code category 250) (pMETAL = 6.39 x 10-9). This study highlights the utility of using PheWAS in conjunction with EHRs to discover new genotypic-phenotypic associations for immune-system related genetic loci.",

        "Abstract": "Next-generation sequencing technology has presented an opportunity for rare variant discovery and association of these variants with disease. To address the challenges of rare variant analysis, multiple statistical methods have been developed for combining rare variants to increase statistical power for detecting associations. BioBin is an automated tool that expands on collapsing/binning methods by performing multi-level variant aggregation with a flexible, biologically informed binning strategy using an internal biorepository, the Library of Knowledge (LOKI). The databases within LOKI provide variant details, regional annotations and pathway interactions which can be used to generate bins of biologically-related variants, thereby increasing the power of any subsequent statistical test. In this study, we expand the framework of BioBin to incorporate statistical tests, including a dispersion-based test, SKAT, thereby providing the option of performing a unified collapsing and statistical rare variant analysis in one tool. Extensive simulation studies performed on gene-coding regions showed a Bin-KAT analysis to have greater power than BioBin-regression in all simulated conditions, including variants influencing the phenotype in the same direction, a scenario where burden tests often retain greater power. The use of Madsen- Browning variant weighting increased power in the burden analysis to that equitable with Bin-KAT; but overall Bin-KAT retained equivalent or higher power under all conditions. Bin-KAT was applied to a study of 82 pharmacogenes sequenced in the Marshfield Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP). We looked for association of these genes with 9 different phenotypes extracted from the electronic health record. This study demonstrates that Bin-KAT is a powerful tool for the identification of genes harboring low frequency variants for complex phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "The incidence and death rate of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have increased in recent years, therefore the identification of novel targets for treatment is extremely important. Interactions between cancer and stromal cells are critically involved in tumour formation and development of metastasis. Here we report that PDAC cells secrete BAG3, which binds and activates macrophages, inducing their activation and the secretion of PDAC supporting factors. We also identify IFITM-2 as a BAG3 receptor and show that it signals through PI3K and the p38 MAPK pathways. Finally, we show that the use of an anti-BAG3 antibody results in reduced tumour growth and prevents metastasis formation in three different mouse models. In conclusion, we identify a paracrine loop involved in PDAC growth and metastatic spreading, and show that an anti-BAG3 antibody has therapeutic potential.",

        "Abstract": "BAG3 is a multi-functional component of tumor cell pro-survival machinery, and its biological functions have been largely associated to proteasome system. Here, we show that BAG3 down-modulation resulted in reduced cell viability and enhanced PEITC-induced apoptosis largely more extensively in HeLa (HPV18(+)) rather than in C33A (HPV(-)) cervical carcinoma cell lines. Moreover, we demonstrate that BAG3 suppression led to a decrease of viral E6 oncoprotein and a concomitant recovery of p53 tumor suppressor, the best recognized target of E6 for proteasome degradation. E6 and p53 expression were modulated at protein level, since their respective mRNAs were unaffected. Taken together our findings reveal a novel role for BAG3 as host protein contributing to HPV18 E6-activated pro-survival strategies, and suggest a possible relevance of its expression levels in drug/radiotherapy-resistance of HPV18-bearing cervical carcinomas.",

        "Abstract": "BAG3, member the HSP70 co-chaperones family, has been shown to play a relevant role in the survival, growth and invasiveness of different tumor types. In this study, we investigate the expression of BAG3 in 66 specimens from different lung tumors and the role of this protein in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumor growth. Normal lung tissue did not express BAG3 while we detected the expression of BAG3 by immunohistochemistry in all the 13 squamous cell carcinomas, 13 adenocarcinomas and 4 large cell carcinomas. Furthermore, we detected BAG3 expression in 22 of the 36 SCLCs analyzed. The role on SCLC cell survival was determined by down-regulating BAG3 levels in two human SCLC cell lines, i.e. H69 and H446, in vitro and measuring cisplatin induced apoptosis. Indeed down-regulation of BAG3 determines increased cell death and sensitizes cells to cisplatin treatment. The effect of BAG3 down-regulation on tumor growth was also investigated in an in vivo xenograft model by treating mice with an adenovirus expressing a specific bag3 siRNA. Treatment with bag3 siRNA-Ad significantly reduced tumor growth and improved animal survival. In conclusion we show that a subset of SCLCs over express BAG3 that exerts an anti-apoptotic effect resulting in resistance to chemotherapy.",

The peptide was designed on the β5-β6 hairpin region of Placenta Growth Factor. NMR studies showed that the peptide assumes in solution a β-hairpin conformation similarly to the corresponding region of the natural ligand. In vitro experiments on endothelial cells demonstrated that the peptide is able to inhibit VEGF biological activity.

        "Abstract": "Vanadium compounds can exert anticancer effects, partly due to inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases. Here, we report the effect of N,N'-ethylenebis (pyridoxylideneiminato) vanadium (IV) complex (Pyr2 enV(IV)), that induced 93% and 57% of cell mortality in A375 (human melanoma) and A549 (human lung carcinoma) cells, respectively; the mortality was <24% in other cancer cell lines and in human normal epidermal keratinocytes, lung cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The mechanism of Pyr2 enV(IV) effect relied on apoptosis induction; this was triggered by ROS increase, followed by mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Indeed, the addition of N-acetyl cysteine to cell cultures abated Pyr2 enV(IV)-induced apoptosis. These results disclose the pro-apoptotic activity of Pyr2 enV(IV) and its mechanism, relying on intracellular ROS increase.",

Since then, the anti-apoptotic activity of BAG3 has been confirmed in other tumor types, where it has been shown to regulate the intracellular concentration and localization of apoptosis-regulating factors, including NF-κB-activating (IKKγ) and Bcl2-family (Bax) proteins. Furthermore, growing evidences support its role in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia response to therapy. Moreover in the last years, the contribution of BAG3 to autophagy, a process known to be involved in the pathogenesis and response to therapy of leukemia cells, has been disclosed, opening a new avenue for the interpretation of the role of this protein in leukemias' biology.",

        "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the main regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Low molecular weight molecules able to stimulate angiogenesis have interesting medical application for example in regenerative medicine, but at present none has reached the clinic. We reported that a VEGF mimetic helical peptide, QK, designed on the VEGF helix sequence 17-25, is able to bind and activate the VEGF receptors, producing angiogenesis. In this study we evaluate the pharmacological properties of peptide QK with the aim to propose it as a VEGF-mimetic drug to be employed in reparative angiogenesis. We show that the peptide QK is able to recapitulate all the biological activities of VEGF in vivo and on endothelial cells. In experiments evaluating sprouting from aortic ring and vessel formation in an in vivo angiogenesis model, the peptide QK showed biological effects comparable with VEGF. At endothelial level, the peptide up-regulates VEGF receptor expression, activates intracellular pathways depending on VEGFR2, and consistently it induces endothelial cell proliferation, survival and migration. When added to angiogenic factors (VEGF and/or FGF-2), QK produces an improved biological action, which resulted in reduced apoptosis and accelerated in vitro wound healing. The VEGF-like activity of the short peptide QK, characterized by lower cost of production and easier handling compared to the native glycoprotein, suggests that it is an attractive candidate to be further developed for application in therapeutic angiogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-dependent Cl(-) channel located in the plasma membrane, and its malfunction results in cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal genetic disease in Caucasians. Most CF patients carry the deletion of Phe508 (ΔF508 mutation); this mutation prevents the delivery of the CFTR to its correct cellular location, the apical (lumen-facing) membrane of epithelial cells. Molecular chaperones play a central role in determining the fate of ΔF508-CFTR. In this report, we show that the Matrine, a quinolizidine alkaloid, downregulates the expression of the molecular chaperone HSC70 and increases the protein levels of ΔF508-CFTR in human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 cell line), stably transfected with a ΔF508-CFTR-expressing construct. Moreover, Matrine induced ΔF508-CFTR release from endoplasmic reticulum to cell cytosol and its localization on the cell membrane. Interestingly, downregulation of HSC70 resulted in increased levels of ΔF508-CFTR complexes with the co-chaperone BAG3 that in addition appeared to co-localize with the mutated protein on the cell surface. These results shed new light on ΔF508-CFTR interactions with proteins of the chaperones/co-chaperones system and could be useful in strategies for future medical treatments for CF.",

        "Abstract": "VEGF receptors have been the target of intense research aimed to develop molecules able to inhibit or stimulate angiogenesis. Based on the x-ray structure of the complex placental growth factor-VEGF receptor 1(D2), we designed a VEGF receptor-binding peptide reproducing the placental growth factor β-hairpin region Gln(87)-Val(100) that is involved in receptor recognition. A conformational analysis showed that the designed peptide adopts the expected fold in pure water. Moreover, a combination of NMR interaction analysis and cell binding studies were used to demonstrate that the peptide targets VEGF receptors. The VEGF receptor 1(D2)-interacting residues were characterized at the molecular level, and they correspond to the residues recognizing the placental growth factor sequence Gln(87)-Val(100). Finally, the peptide biological activity was characterized in vitro and in vivo, and it showed a VEGF-like behavior. Indeed, the peptide activated VEGF-dependent intracellular pathways, induced endothelial cell proliferation and rescue from apoptosis, and promoted angiogenesis in vivo. This compound is one of the few peptides known with proangiogenic activity, which makes it a candidate for the development of a novel peptide-based drug for medical applications in therapeutic angiogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BAG3 is induced in several cell types by exposure to high temperature, oxidants, and other stressful agents. We investigated whether exposure to 50 Hz electromagnetic fields raised BAG3 levels in the human melanoma cell line M14, in vitro and in orthotopic xenografts. Exposure of cultured cells or xenografts for 6 h or 4 weeks, respectively, produced a significant (P < 0.01) increase in BAG3 protein amounts. Interestingly, at the same times, we could not detect any significant variation in the levels of HSP70/72 protein or cell apoptosis. These results confirm the stressful effect of exposure to ELF in human cells, by identifying BAG3 protein as a marker of ELF-induced stress. Furthermore, they suggest that BAG3 induction by ELF may contribute to melanoma cell survival and/or resistance to therapy.",

It is mainly regulated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors, which are the main targets of molecules able to modulate the angiogenic response. Pharmaceutical therapies based on antiangiogenic drugs represent a promising approach for the treatment of several socially important diseases. We report the biological and structural characterization of a VEGF receptor binder peptide designed on the N-terminal helix of VEGF. The reported experimental evidence shows that the peptide assumes in water a well-defined helical conformation and indicates that this peptide is a VEGF receptor antagonist and possesses antiangiogenic biological activity. In particular, it inhibits VEGF stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, activation, and survival, as well as angiogenesis and tumor progression in vivo. This peptide is a candidate for the development of novel peptide-based drugs for the treatment of diseases associated with excessive VEGF-dependent angiogenesis.",

        "Title": "Evidence for modulation of BAG3 by polyomavirus JC early protein.",
        "Abstract": "Polyomavirus JC (JCV) infects oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in the brain and is the cause of the demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). In cell culture, JCV infection is characterized by severe damage to cellular DNA, which begins early in infection, and a viral cytopathic effect, which is observed late in infection. Nevertheless, these JCV-infected cells show a low level of apoptosis, at both the early and late stages of infection. This suggests that there is conflicting interplay between viral anti-apoptotic pathways that seek to optimize virus production, e.g. through T antigen (T-Ag)-p53 interaction, and cellular pro-apoptotic pathways that seek to eliminate virally infected cells. The apoptosis regulatory protein BAG3 is a member of the human Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG) family of proteins, which function as molecular co-chaperones through their interaction with Hsc70/Hsp70 and function in the regulation of the cellular stress response, proliferation and apoptosis. This study showed that BAG3 protein is downregulated upon JCV infection and that this effect is mediated by JCV T-Ag via repression of the BAG3 promoter. The site of action of T-Ag was mapped to an AP2 site in the BAG3 promoter, and gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that T-Ag inhibited AP2 binding to this site, resulting in downregulation of BAG3 promoter expression. Using BAG3 and T-Ag expression and BAG3 siRNA, it was found that BAG3 and T-Ag had antagonistic effects on the induction of apoptosis, being anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic, respectively. The significance of these interactions to the JCV life cycle is discussed.",

        "Abstract": "The nucleic acid binding protein, Pur-alpha, is best characterized as a transcription factor with affinity to single stranded G/C rich regions. Pur-alpha exhibits developmental and tissue-specific regulation and plays a critical role in neuronal development and differentiation. Similar to Pur-alpha, the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a developmentally regulated protein which promotes neuronal survival. Both the human and mouse AbetaPP promoters contain multiple G/C rich sequences which regulate AbetaPP at the transcriptional and translational levels. Using an in vitro reporter assay, we confirmed that Pur-alpha consensus binding sites within the human AbetaPP promoter down-regulate AbetaPP transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) showed direct binding of Pur-alpha to the AbetaPP promoter. Down regulation of AbetaPP went beyond the transcriptional level as overexpression of Pur-alpha in glial and fibroblast cell lines decreased basal levels of AbetaPP while siRNA targeting Pur-alpha increased basal levels of AbetaPP. Similar findings were observed in brain tissue and fibroblasts from mice with targeted deletion of Pur-alpha. These data point to a novel mechanism of controlling AbetaPP levels by the transcriptional regulatory protein, Pur-alpha, and suggest that Pur-alpha may be involved in the dysregulation of AbetaPP in Alzheimer's disease.",

Among the proofs conventionally required for a factor to be considered a risk factor for a definite pathology, there is the demonstration of a trend in risk exposure related to disease severity. We sought whether such a trend existed in the association of vascular risk factors or comorbidities with the severity of ARWMC aiming particularly at further elucidating the relative roles of hypertension and stroke in this regard.",

        "Abstract": "Disability is a major negative consequence of aging, with impact on several domains of individual, familial, and social life, and a major source of expenditure for social systems. Preventing or delaying disability in the elderly depends not only on understanding the etiology of pathological processes causing disability, but also on the identification of the early stages of disability (preclinical disability). Vascular dementia may have an impact on disability with variable severity and patterns compared to nonvascular forms of dementia. Vascular cognitive impairment is consistent with a preclinical disability status in which cognitive impairment, already manifested, might not interfere substantially with everyday life activities, but might still cause subtle difficulties in selective performances, like those linked with executive functions. Instruments comprehensive and sensitive enough to describe global function in such a context should be specifically designed and validated.",

        "Abstract": "Age-related white matter changes (ARWMC) on brain MRI have been associated with cognitive, motor, mood and urinary disturbances. These factors are known to contribute to disability in elderly people, but the impact of ARWMC and of their progression on the transition to disability is not determined. The LADIS (Leukoaraiosis and Disability in the Elderly) study aims at assessing the role of ARWMC as an independent predictor of the transition to disability in initially nondisabled elderly (65-84 years). Subjects who are not impaired or impaired on only 1 item of the Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) scale, presenting with different grades of ARWMC severity, were enrolled. Eleven European centers are involved. All the patients were assessed at baseline using an extensive set of clinical and functional tests including global functioning, cognitive, motor, psychiatric and quality of life measures. MRI studies were performed at baseline and will be repeated at the end of the follow-up period to evaluate changes of ARWMC and other lesions. ARWMC were categorized into mild, moderate or severe using the scale of Fazekas et al. For each ARWMC severity class, the primary study outcome is the transition to disability defined as an impairment on 2 or more IADL scale items. Secondary outcomes are the occurrence of dementia, depression, vascular events or death. Six-hundred and thirty-nine subjects (mean age 74.13 +/- 5.0 years, M/F: 288/351) were enrolled in a hospital-based setting and are being followed up for up to 3 years. The large and comprehensive set of measures in LADIS enables a comprehensive description of their functional and clinical features to be examined in relation to different morphological patterns and severity of ARWMC. The longitudinal design will give insight into the possible role of ARWMC and their progression as an independent contributor to disability in the elderly, eventually helping to develop preventive strategies to reduce the burden of disability in late life. The study results may also help to standardize, on an international basis, tools and criteria to identify early stages of disability.",
