        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Over the past two decades, numerous researchers have provided important evidence regarding the role of tight junction (TJ) proteins in the occurrence and progression of CRC. The causal relationship between the presence of specific TJ proteins and the development of CRC has also been confirmed. Despite the large number of publications in this field, a bibliometric study to review the current state of research and highlight the research trends and hotspots in this field has not yet been performed.",

AR is closely associated with tumor cell metastasis and recurrence, enabling tumor cells to disseminate, migrate, and invade after detachment. To address this issue, a novel intervention method combining intraoperative hemostasis with multifunctional nanozyme driven-enhanced chemodynamic therapy (ECDT) has been proposed, which holds the potential to weaken the AR capability of tumor cells and suppress tumor recurrence.

        "Abstract": "Sunitinib, a primary treatment for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), frequently encounters the challenge of resistance development. Metabolic reprogramming, a characteristic change in ccRCC, is likely linked to this resistance. Our research revealed a notable decrease in the expression of the key metabolic gene ABAT in ccRCC, which contributed to diminished sensitivity to sunitinib. Downregulation of ABAT led to an increase in the intracellular level of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), triggering abnormal activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor GABA-B. This activation resulted in increased transactivation of the tyrosine kinase receptors SYK and LYN, thereby reducing the antitumor and antiangiogenic properties of sunitinib. However, the application of SYK and LYN inhibitors successfully inhibited this effect. The transactivation of SYK and LYN caused resistance to the antiangiogenic effects of sunitinib through the upregulation of PGF protein levels. Furthermore, the combined application of an LYN inhibitor with sunitinib has been shown to enhance therapeutic efficacy.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiological evidence indicates an association between exposure to toxic metals and the occurrence of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs). However, the impact of exposure to harmful metallic elements, such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg), on mortality in individuals with cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) remains uncertain. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed data from 4139 adults diagnosed with CMM from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2016. CMM was defined as the presence of at least two CMDs (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and coronary artery disease). Over an average follow-up period of 9.0 years, 1379 deaths from all causes, 515 deaths related to cardiovascular disease (CVD), and 215 deaths attributable to cancer were recorded. After adjusting for potential covariates, serum Pb concentrations were not associated with all-cause, CVD, or cancer mortality. Participants exposed to Cd had an elevated risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95â¯% CI, 1.16-1.30), CVD-related mortality (HR, 1.23; 95â¯% CI, 1.12-1.35), and cancer-related mortality (HR, 1.29; 95â¯% CI, 1.13-1.47). Participants with serum Hg levels in the highest quantile had lower risks of all-cause (HR, 0.64; 95â¯% CI, 0.52-0.80) and CVD-related (HR, 0.62; 95â¯% CI, 0.44-0.88) mortality than did those in the lowest quantile. Stratified analyses revealed significant interactions between serum Cd concentrations and age for CVD-related mortality (P for interaction =0.011), indicating that CMM participants aged < 60 years who were exposed to Cd were at a greater risk of CVD-related mortality. A nonlinear relationship was observed between serum Cd concentrations and all-cause (P for nonlinear relationship = 0.012) and CVD-related (P for nonlinear relationship < 0.001) mortality. Minimizing Cd exposure in patients with CMM may help prevent premature death.",

Urging demand for rapid determiningÂ TAP in water has risen. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing turns out to be a good candidate for its simplicity in fabrication and swiftness in detection. Nevertheless, traditional PEC sensors often lack selectivity as their signal generation primarily relies on the oxidation of organic compounds in the electrolyte by photo-induced holes. To address this limitation, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) can be in combined with PEC sensors to significantly enhance the selectivity. Here, we present a novel approach utilizing a PEC sensor enhanced by carbon-modified titanium dioxide molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP/C/TiO",

        "Abstract": "InGaAs detection systems have been increasingly used in the aerospace field, and due to the high signal-to-noise ratio requirements of short-wave infrared quantitative payloads, there is an urgent need for methods for the rapid and precise evaluation and the optimal design of these systems. The rigid-flex printed circuit board (PCB) is a vital component of InGaAs detectors, as its grid ground plane design parameters impact parasitic capacitance and thus affect weak infrared analog signals. To address the time-intensive and costly nature of design optimization achieved with simulations and experimental measurements, we propose an innovative method based on a neural network to predict the scattering parameters of rigid-flex boards for InGaAs detection links. This is the first study in which the effects of rigid-flex boards on weak infrared detection signals have been considered. We first obtained sufficient samples with software simulation. A backpropagation (BP) neural network prediction model was trained on existing sample sets and then verified on a rigid-flex board used in a crucial aerospace short-wave infrared quantitative mission. The model efficiently and accurately predicted high-speed interconnect scattering parameters under various rigid-flex board grid plane parameter conditions. The prediction error was less than 1% compared with a 3D field solver, indicating an overcoming of the iterative optimization inefficiency and showing improved design quality for InGaAs detection circuits.",

        "Abstract": "Pyrolysis holds immense potential for clean treatment of pulp and paper mill sludge (PPMS), enabling efficient energy and chemical recovery. However, current understanding of PPMS pyrolysis kinetics and product characteristics remains incomplete. This study conducted detailed modeling of pyrolysis kinetics for two typical PPMSs from a wastepaper pulp and paper mill, namely, deinking sludge (PPMS-DS) and sewage sludge (PPMS-SS), and analyzed comprehensively pyrolysis products. The results show that apparent activation energy of PPMS-DS (169.25-226.82Â kJ/mol) and PPMS-SS (189.29-411.21Â kJ/mol) pyrolysis undergoes significant change, with numerous parallel reactions present. A distributed activation energy model with dual logistic distributions proves to be suitable for modeling thermal decomposition kinetics of both PPMS-DS and PPMS-SS, with coefficient of determination >0.999 and relative root mean square error <1.99Â %. High temperature promotes decomposition of solid organic materials in PPMS, and maximum tar yield for both PPMS-DS (53.90Â wt%, daf) and PPMS-SS (56.48Â wt%, daf) is achieved at around 500Â Â°C. Higher levels of styrene (24.45Â % for PPMS-DS and 14.71Â % for PPMS-SS) and ethylbenzene (8.61Â % for PPMS-DS and 8.33Â % for PPMS-SS) are detected in tar and could be used as chemicals. This work shows great potential to propel development of PPMS pyrolysis technology, enabling green and sustainable production in pulp and paper industry.",

        "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known to be linked with dyslipidemia. Between March and June 2022, we collected 575 fasting serum samples from individuals without occupational exposure in Jinan, China. Eighteen PFASs were analyzed using UHPLC-Orbitrap MS. Multiple linear regression (MLR), Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), and Quantile g-computation (QGC) models were utilized to assess the effects of both individual PFAS and PFAS mixtures on serum lipid levels, including triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (CHO), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The PFAS mixture, composed of perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluoroheptane sulfonic acid (PFHpS), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA), showed a positive association with CHO and LDL levels, while no distinct trend was noted in HDL and TG levels about changes in PFAS mixtures levels in BKMR and QGC models, adjusted for gender, age, BMI, occupation, and educational level. The effects of individual PFASs on lipid levels were in general consistent across MLR, BKMR and QGC models. PFUnDA and PFTrDA demonstrated greater impacts on blood lipid levels compared to other PFAS, albeit with varied directional effects. Age-stratified analysis revealed PFAS mixture effect was more pronounced in participants aged higher than 40. No obvious trend in lipid levels with changes in PFAS mixture levels in participants with age ranged from 18 to 40, while positive association between PFAS mixture and CHO and LDL was detected in participants aged higher than 40.",

        "Abstract": "The synthesis of iron-based nanoparticles (Fe NPs) using traditional preparation methods suffered from the disadvantages of high cost, environmental harm, and easy agglomeration. In this study, a novel eco-friendly method was proposed for the synthesis of iron nanomaterials (ML-Fe NPs): using antioxidant components extracted from mulberry leaf to reduce divalent iron (II). The preparation conditions of ML-Fe NPs were optimized by orthogonal tests. The prepared ML-Fe NPs exhibited an amorphous core-shell structure, displaying excellent dispersion and stability. During the synthesis process of ML-Fe NPs, the polyphenol molecules in mulberry leaf extract played a dominant role. A possible synthetic mechanism involving complexation, reduction, and encapsulation was proposed. Furthermore, the ML-Fe NPs were utilized to construct an ML-Fe NPs/peroxymonosulfate catalytic system for the degradation of Rhodamine B dye wastewater. The ML-Fe NPs demonstrated remarkable catalytic potential, achieving a 99% degradation efficiency for Rhodamine B within a span of 40Â min.",

Traditional anomaly detection approaches often strongly depend on data size, structure and features, while introducing the idea of ensemble into anomaly detection can greatly improve the generalization ability. Ensemble-based anomaly detection methods still face some challenges, however, such as data imbalance, time and space demand and the selection of base detectors. To this end, we propose a selective ensemble method for anomaly detection based on parallel learning (SEAD-PL). First, a differentiated stratified sampling method is designed to alleviate the problem of data imbalance. Then, a distributed parallel training frame is built to address the problem of excessive time and space consumption for base detector training. Finally, a clustering-based ensemble selection strategy is introduced to balance the accuracy and diversity of base detectors. Experiments are performed on six datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed method has obvious advantages over four selected methods.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal microecology is a dominant and complex microecological system in human body. Generally, intestinal microecosystem consists of normal symbiotic flora and its living environment (including intestinal epithelial tissue and intestinal mucosal immune system). Commensal flora is the core component of microecology. Both structures of intestinal mucosa and functions of immune system are essential to maintain homeostasis of intestinal microecosystem. Under normal conditions, intestinal microorganisms and intestinal mucosa coordinate with each other to promote host immunity. When certain factors in the intestine are altered, such as disruption of the intestinal barrier causing dysbiosis of the intestinal flora, the immune system of the host intestinal mucosa makes a series of responses, which leads to the development of intestinal inflammation and promotes colorectal cancer. In this review, to further understand the relationship between intestinal microecology and intestinal diseases, we systematically elaborate the composition of the intestinal mucosal immune system, analyze the relationship between intestinal flora and mucosal immune system, and the role of intestinal flora on intestinal inflammatory diseases and colorectal cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate estimation of grassland leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and aboveground biomass (AGB) is fundamental in grassland studies. The newly launched Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI) sensor onboard Sentinel-3 (S3) provides images with comparable spatial and spectral resolution with MODIS data. However, the use of S3 OLCI imageries for vegetation variable estimation is rarely evaluated. This study evaluated the potential of S3 OLCI and MODIS data for estimating grassland LAI, FVC, and AGB in the eastern Eurasian steppe. A Bayesian spatial model (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation with Stochastic Partial Differential Equation, INLA-SPDE) was used to address spatial autocorrelation of in-situ observation data and to enhance our predictions. Our results showed that the models based on S3 OLCI data presented higher accuracy than models with MODIS data. The RMSEs decreased by 3.7-10.8Â %, 3.7-7.5Â %, and 1.6-14.2Â % for LAI, FVC, and AGB predictions, respectively. Through combinations of multiple predictors, we confirmed the robustness of red edge bands for grassland variable estimation, the models employing red edge variables yielded 3.5Â %, 3.2Â %, and 0.4Â % lower RMSEs than models with conventional visible and NIR bands for LAI, FVC, and AGB prediction, respectively. INLA-SPDE spatial model produced lower bias and higher prediction accuracy than random forest and random forests kriging method in most of the models; the INLA-SPDE predicted LAI and FVC maps also showed a better agreement with ground observations than MODIS and PROBA-V land products.",

        "Abstract": "Optical multiplexing for nanoscale object recognition is of great significance within the intricate domains of biology, medicine, anti-counterfeiting, and microscopic imaging. Traditionally, the multiplexing dimensions of nanoscopy are limited to emission intensity, color, lifetime, and polarization. Here, a novel dimension, optical nonlinearity, is proposed for super-resolved multiplexing microscopy. This optical nonlinearity is attributable to the energy transitions between multiple energy levels of the doped lanthanide ions in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), resulting in unique optical fingerprints for UCNPs with different compositions. A vortex beam is applied to transport the optical nonlinearity onto the imaging point-spread function (PSF), creating a robust super-resolved multiplexing imaging strategy for differentiating UCNPs with distinctive optical nonlinearities. The composition information of the nanoparticles can be retrieved with variations of the corresponding PSF in the obtained image. Four channels multiplexing super-resolved imaging with a single scanning, applying emission color and nonlinearity of two orthogonal imaging dimensions with a spatial resolution higher than 150Â nm (1/6.5Î»), are demonstrated. This work provides a new and orthogonal dimension - optical nonlinearity - to existing multiplexing dimensions, which shows great potential in bioimaging, anti-counterfeiting, microarray assays, deep tissue multiplexing detection, and high-density data storage.",

        "Title": "Distribution characteristics of non-point source pollution of TP and identification of key source areas in Nanyi Lake (China) Basin: based on InVEST model and source list method.",
        "Abstract": "The Nanyi Lake basin, located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, is a crucial component of the Yangtze River ecosystem. Excessive phosphorus levels lead to eutrophication in rivers and lakes. This study aims to enhance the identification efficiency of key source areas for non-point source pollution of total phosphorus (TP) in the Nanyi Lake Basin and improve decision-making regarding the treatment of these areas. The study employs the InVEST model and utilizes GIS spatial hot spot analysis to identify key source areas of agricultural TP non-point source pollution. The accuracy of the InVEST model's simulation results was verified using the source list method. The findings indicate that paddy fields serve as the primary pollution source. TP non-point source pollution in Nanyi Lake is influenced by pollution sources, pollution load filtration rate, and potential TP runoff mass concentration. Different pollution sources correspond to distinct key source areas, and the pollution generated by these sources in different administrative regions, ultimately affecting the lake, varies as well. The InVEST model demonstrates great applicability in regions where agricultural TP is the primary pollution source. For the Nanyi Lake basin, which predominantly experiences agricultural TP non-point source pollution, a combination of the InVEST model and the source list method is recommended. The InVEST model serves as the primary tool, while the source list method supplements it. This approach not only compensates for any limitations of the InVEST model's simulation results but also avoids unnecessary economic waste. The outcomes of this study contribute to a deeper scientific understanding of TP pollution in the Nanyi Lake Basin. They also aid in effectively identifying key source areas and formulating appropriate measures based on the pollution characteristics, thereby providing guidance for non-point source pollution control in the basin.",

        "Abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) regenerate after myeloablation, a procedure that adversely disrupts the bone marrow and drives leptin receptor-expressing cells, a key niche component, to differentiate extensively into adipocytes. Regeneration of the bone marrow niche is associated with the resolution of adipocytes, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using Plin1-creER knock-in mice, we followed the fate of adipocytes in the regenerating niche in vivo. We found that bone marrow adipocytes were highly dynamic and dedifferentiated to leptin receptor-expressing cells during regeneration after myeloablation. Bone marrow adipocytes could give rise to osteolineage cells after skeletal injury. The cellular fate of steady-state bone marrow adipocytes was also plastic. Deletion of adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl) from bone marrow stromal cells, including adipocytes, obstructed adipocyte dedifferentiation and led to severely compromised regeneration of HSCs as well as impaired B lymphopoiesis after myeloablation, but not in the steady state. Thus, the regeneration of HSCs and their niche depends on the cellular plasticity of bone marrow adipocytes.",

        "Abstract": "MCM4 forms the pre-replication complex (MCM2-7) with five other minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins. This complex binds to replication origins at G1 stage in cell cycle process, playing a critical role in DNA replication initiation. Recently, MCM4 is reported to have a complex interaction with multiple cancer progression, including gastric, ovarian and cervical cancer. Here, this study mainly focused on the expression of MCM4 and its values in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). MCM4 was highly expressed in LUAD tumours and cells, and had an important effect on the overall survival. Overexpression of MCM4 promoted the proliferation, and suppressed the apoptosis in LUAD cells. However, MCM4 silence led to the opposite results. In vivo, knockdown of MCM4 inhibited tumour volume and weight in xenograft mouse model. As a member of DNA helicase, knockdown of MCM4 caused cell cycle arrest at G1 stage through inducing the expression of P21, a CDK inhibitor. These findings indicate that MCM4 may be a possible new therapeutic target for LUAD in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Since its development, spinal cord functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has utilized various methodologies and stimulation protocols to develop a deeper understanding of a healthy human spinal cord that lays a foundation for its use in clinical research and practice. In this review, we conducted a comprehensive literature search on spinal cord fMRI studies and summarized the recent advancements and resulting scientific achievements of spinal cord fMRI in the following three aspects: the current state of spinal cord fMRI methodologies and stimulation protocols, knowledge about the healthy spinal cord's functions obtained via spinal cord fMRI, and fMRI's exemplary usage in spinal cord diseases and injuries. We conclude with a discussion that, while technical challenges exist, novel fMRI technologies for and new knowledge about the healthy human spinal cord have been established. Empowered by these developments, investigations of pathological and injury states within the spinal cord have become the next important direction of spinal cord fMRI. Recent clinical investigations into spinal cord pathologies, for example, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and cervical spondylotic myelopathy, have already provided deep insights into spinal cord impairments and the time course of impairment-caused changes. We expect that future spinal cord fMRI advancement and research development will further enhance our understanding of various spinal cord diseases and provide the foundation for evaluating existing and developing new treatment plans.",

        "Title": "Driving impact and spatial effect of the digital economy development on carbon emissions in typical cities: a case study of Zhejiang, China.",
        "Abstract": "The digital economy (DE) not only drives economic innovation and development but also has significant environmental effects by promoting lower carbon emissions. To investigate the spatial effects of DE on urban carbon emissions, this study comprehensively measures the level of DE development based on the panel data from 11 typical cities in Zhejiang Province from 2011 to 2020, by comparing analysis using different regression models. The following conclusions are obtained: (1) The total carbon emissions (TC) of Zhejiang cities in general show a fluctuating change trend of first increasing and then slowly decreasing, while carbon emission intensity and carbon emission per capita in general show a fluctuating change trend of decreasing. Cities with high TC are primarily concentrated in the Hangzhou Bay city cluster, accounted for 62â~â65% of the province's carbon emissions. The development of the DE in Zhejiang cities shows steady growth, but there are large differences among cities, with Hangzhou and Ningbo standing out as particularly prominent. (2) There is a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between the DE and the level of carbon emissions in Zhejiang Province. The influence coefficient of the DE on the primary term of TC is 0.613, and the influence coefficient of the quadratic term of TC isâ-â1.008. (3) In terms of the spatial spillover effect of the DE on carbon emissions, the study finds that compared to the direct effect, the spatial spillover effect is not significant. However, the allocation of transport resources shows a positive spatial spillover effect (increasing carbon emissions, coefficient value is 0.138), while technological progress shows a somewhat negative spatial spillover effect (decreasing carbon emissions, coefficient value isâ-â0.035). (4) The study also finds that the smart city pilot policy significantly reduces urban carbon emissions. Moreover, the effect of the DE on carbon emissions is confirmed through the significance test of the quadratic term when replacing the geographical and economic distance weight matrices. This indicates that the empirical findings are robust to these tests. Finally, several countermeasures to reduce carbon emissions are proposed from the perspective of DE development.",

        "Abstract": "The effectiveness of thermal ablation for the treatment of liver tumours is limited by the risk of incomplete ablation, which can result in residual tumours. Herein, an enhancement strategy is proposed based on the controlled release of Ganoderma applanatum polysaccharide (GAP) liposome-microbubble complexes (GLMCs) via ultrasound (US)-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) and sublethal hyperthermic (SH) field. GLMCs were prepared by conjugating GAP liposomes onto the surface of microbubbles via biotin-avidin linkage. In vitro, UTMD promotes the cellular uptake of liposomes and leads to apoptosis of M2-like macrophages. Secretion of arginase-1 (Arg-1) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Î²) by M2-like macrophages decreased. In vivo, restriction of tumour volume was observed in rabbit VX2 liver tumours after treatment with GLMCs via UTMD in GLMCs + SHÂ +Â US group. The expression levels of CD68 and CD163, as markers of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the GLMCs + SHÂ +Â US group were reduced in liver tumour tissue. Decreased Arg-1, TGF-Î², Ki67, and CD31 factors related to tumour cell proliferation and angiogenesis was evident on histological analysis. In conclusion, thermal/US-triggered drug release from GLMCs suppressed rabbit VX2 liver tumour growth in the SH field by inhibiting TAMs, which represents a potential approach to improve the effectiveness of thermal ablation.",

        "Abstract": "Programmable smart textiles with adaptive moisture/heat conditioning (MHC) capabilities are globally being sought to meet the requirements of comfort, energy efficiency, and health protection. However, a universal strategy for fabricating truly scalable and customizable MHC textiles is lacking. In this study, we introduce a scalable in situ grafting approach for the continuous fabrication of two series of smart textile yarns with opposite thermoresponsive wetting behaviors. In particular, the wetting transition temperature can be precisely programmed by adjusting the grafting formula, making the yarns highly customizable. The smart yarns demonstrated excellent mechanical strength, whiteness, weavability, biocompatibility, and washability (with more than 60 home washes), comparable to those of regular textile yarns. They can serve as building blocks independently or in combination to create smart textiles with adaptive sweat wicking and intelligent moisture/heat regulation capabilities. A proposed hybrid textile integrating both the two series of smart yarns can offer dry-contact and cooling/keep-warming effects of approximately 1.6/2.8Â Â°C, respectively, in response to changes in ambient temperature. Our method provides a rich array of design options for nonpowered MHC textiles while maintaining a balance between traditional wearing conventions and large-scale production.",

A significantly higher proportion of patients age 70 and over received non-intensive therapy (NIT) in 2021-22 as compared with 2013-16 (65 % vs 44 %, pÂ =Â 0.014), with a corresponding reduction in the proportion receiving either intensive therapy or no antileukemic treatment. Treatment patterns among patients < age 70 were unchanged. The complete response rate in the NIT group was 69 % in 2021-22 vs. 24 % in 2013-16 (pÂ <Â 0.001); the overall survival (OS) of NIT patients was 11.5 months in 2021-22 vs. 7.8 months in 2013-16. Older patients from rural areas were more likely to decline therapy than those from urban regions. The increase in the proportion of patients opting for NIT may be related to the availability of more effective treatment options. Although outcomes are improving, the OS with NIT remains suboptimal.",

        "Abstract": "Metabolic disorders represent a major therapeutic challenge to public health worldwide due to their dramatically increasing prevalence. Acupuncture is widely used as adjuvant therapy for multiple metabolic diseases. However, detailed biological interpretation of the acupuncture stimulations is still limited. The gut and the liver are intrinsically connected and related to metabolic function. Microbial metabolites might affect the gut-liver axis through multiple mechanisms. Liver metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing were used to explore the specific mechanism of electroacupuncture in treating ZDF rats in this study. Electroacupuncture effectively improved glycolipid metabolism disorders of the ZDF rats. Histopathology confirmed that electroacupuncture improved diffuse hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte vacuolation, and promoted glycogen accumulation in the liver. The treatment significantly improved microbial diversity and richness and upregulated beneficial bacteria that maintain intestinal epithelial homeostasis and decreased bacteria with detrimental metabolic features on host metabolism. Liver metabolomics showed that the main effects of electroacupuncture include reducing the carbon flow and intermediate products in the TCA cycle, regulating the metabolism of various amino acids, and inhibiting hepatic glucose output and ",

The experimental data of scattered light of Oleic acid, rod-shaped Silicon dioxide, and other particles with typical shape characteristics were analyzed statistically. To better study the relationship between the shape of particles and the properties of scattered light, the partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) method was used to analyze the scattered light of aerosol samples based on the size screening of particles, and the shape recognition and classification method of the individual aerosol particle was established based on the analysis of the spectral data after nonlinear processing and grouping by particle size with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as reference. The experimental results show that the proposed classification method has a good discrimination ability for spherical, rod-shaped, and other non-spherical particles, which can provide more information for atmospheric aerosol measurement, and has application value for traceability and exposure hazard assessment of aerosol particles.",

        "Abstract": "Background Collagenases are frequently used in chondrocyte isolation from articular cartilage. However, the sufficiency of this enzyme in establishing primary human chondrocyte culture remains unknown. Methods Cartilage slices shaved from femoral head or tibial plateau of patients receiving total joint replacement surgery (16 hips, 8 knees) were subjected to 0.02% collagenase IA digestion for 16Â h with (Nâ=â19) or without (Nâ=â5) the pre-treatment of 0.4% pronase E for 1.5Â h. Chondrocyte yield and viability were compared between two groups. Chondrocyte phenotype was determined by the expression ratio of collagen type II to I. The morphology of cultured chondrocytes was monitored with a light microscope.Results Cartilage with pronase E pre-treatment yielded significantly higher chondrocytes than that without the pre-treatment (3,399âÂ±â1,637 cells/mg wet cartilage vs. 1,895âÂ±â688 cells/mg wet cartilage; Pâ=â0.0067). Cell viability in the former group was also significantly higher than that in the latter (94%âÂ±â2% vs. 86%âÂ±â6%; Pâ=â0.03). When cultured in monolayers, cells from cartilage with pronase E pre-treatment grew in a single plane showing rounded shape while cells from the other group grew in multi-planes and exhibited irregular shape. The mRNA expression ratio of collagen type II to I was 13.2âÂ±â7.5 in cells isolated from cartilage pre-treated with pronase E, indicating a typical chondrocyte phenotype. Conclusions Collagenase IA was not sufficient in establishing primary human chondrocyte culture. Cartilage must be treated with pronase E prior to collagenase IA application.",

        "Abstract": "Pesticide residue has become the main technical barrier that restricts the export of Chinese wolfberry. Can we achieve high efficacy and low safety risk by balancing pesticide deposition on the leaves and fruits of Chinese wolfberry? In this research, the structural characteristics and wettability of leaves and fruits of Chinese wolfberry at different growth stages were studied. The adaxial and abaxial surfaces of leaves were hydrophobic, whereas the fruit surfaces were hydrophilic. Adding spray adjuvant could increase the retention of droplets on the leaf surfaces of Chinese wolfberry by 52.28-97.89% and reduce the retention on the fruit surfaces by 21.68-42.14%. A structural equation model analysis showed that the adhesion tension was the key factor affecting the retention of the solutions among various interface behaviors. When the concentrations of Silwet618, AEO-5, Gemini 31551, and 1227 were 2-5 times higher than their CMCs, the retention of pesticide solutions (pyraclostrobin and tylophorine) on Chinese wolfberry leaves significantly increased, and the control efficacies on aphids and powdery mildew also dramatically improved (65.90-105.15 and 41.18-133.06%, respectively). Meanwhile, the retention of pesticides on the fruit of Chinese wolfberry was reduced. This study provides new insights into increasing the utilization of pesticides in controlling pests and improving food safety.",

        "Abstract": "Growing evidence has proved that RNA editing enzyme ADAR1, responsible for detecting endogenous RNA species, was significantly associated with poor response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Here, a genetically engineered nanovesicle (siAdar1-LNP@mPD1) was developed as an RNA interference nano-tool to overcome tumor resistance to ICB therapies. Small interfering RNA against ADAR1 (siAdar1) was packaged into a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), which was further coated with plasma membrane extracted from the genetically engineered cells overexpressing PD1. siAdar1-LNP@mPD1 could block the PD1/PDL1 immune inhibitory axis by presenting the PD1 protein on the coating membranes. Furthermore, siAdar1 could be effectively delivered into cancer cells by the designed nanovesicle to silence ADAR1 expression, resulting in an increased type I/II interferon (IFN-Î²/Î³) production and making the cancer cells more sensitive to secreted effector cytokines such as IFN-Î³ with significant cell growth arrest. These integrated functions confer siAdar1-LNP@mPD1 with robust and comprehensive antitumor immunity, as evidenced by significant tumor growth regression, abscopal tumor prevention, and effective suppression of lung metastasis, through a global remodeling of the tumor immune microenvironment. Overall, we provided a promising translatable strategy to simultaneously silence ADAR1 and block PDL1 immune checkpoint to boost robust antitumor immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is considered as an important target in the research of antitumor drugs. Taking the CDK2/4/6 inhibitor Ebvaciclib as the positive control and an in-house library compound (23) as the lead compound, three classes of 30 target compounds with pteridin-7(8H)-one as the core structure were designed to establish structure-activity relationships (SAR). In general, SAR of pteridin-7(8H)-one CDK2 inhibitors is systematically described in this paper, resulting in the discovery of two compounds (KII-17 and KII-21) with further research value. After the above compounds were tested for CDK2/4/6 kinase selectivity, we found that compound KII-21 was about 3 and 4 times more selective to CDK2-cyclinE2 than CDK4-cyclinD1 and CDK6-cyclinD3, respectively. This work also provides a reference basis for the subsequent research on CDK2 inhibitors.",

        "Title": "A method for generating synthetic longitudinal health data.",
        "Abstract": "Getting access to administrative health data for research purposes is a difficult and time-consuming process due to increasingly demanding privacy regulations. An alternative method for sharing administrative health data would be to share synthetic datasets where the records do not correspond to real individuals, but the patterns and relationships seen in the data are reproduced. This paper assesses the feasibility of generating synthetic administrative health data using a recurrent deep learning model. Our data comes from 120,000 individuals from Alberta Health's administrative health database. We assess how similar our synthetic data is to the real data using utility assessments that assess the structure and general patterns in the data as well as by recreating a specific analysis in the real data commonly applied to this type of administrative health data. We also assess the privacy risks associated with the use of this synthetic dataset. Generic utility assessments that used Hellinger distance to quantify the difference in distributions between real and synthetic datasets for event types (0.027), attributes (mean 0.0417), Markov transition matrices (order 1 mean absolute difference: 0.0896, sd: 0.159; order 2: mean Hellinger distance 0.2195, sd: 0.2724), the Hellinger distance between the joint distributions was 0.352, and the similarity of random cohorts generated from real and synthetic data had a mean Hellinger distance of 0.3 and mean Euclidean distance of 0.064, indicating small differences between the distributions in the real data and the synthetic data. By applying a realistic analysis to both real and synthetic datasets, Cox regression hazard ratios achieved a mean confidence interval overlap of 68% for adjusted hazard ratios among 5 key outcomes of interest, indicating synthetic data produces similar analytic results to real data. The privacy assessment concluded that the attribution disclosure risk associated with this synthetic dataset was substantially less than the typical 0.09 acceptable risk threshold. Based on these metrics our results show that our synthetic data is suitably similar to the real data and could be shared for research purposes thereby alleviating concerns associated with the sharing of real data in some circumstances.",

        "Abstract": "Tripartite Motif Protein 72 (TRIM72, also named MG53) mediates membrane damage repair through membrane fusion and exocytosis. During injury, TRIM72 molecules form intermolecular disulfide bonds in response to the oxidative environment and TRIM72 oligomers are proposed to connect vesicles to the plasma membrane and promote membrane fusion in conjunction with other partners like dysferlin and caveolin. However, the detailed mechanism of TRIM72 oligomerization and action remains unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of TRIM72 B-box-coiled-coil-SPRY domains (BCC-SPRY), revealing the molecular basis of TRIM72 oligomerization, which is closely linked to disulfide bond formation. Through structure-guided mutagenesis, we have identified and characterized key residues that are important for the membrane repair function of TRIM72. Our results also demonstrate that TRIM72 interacts with several kinds of negatively charged lipids in addition to phosphatidylserine. Our work provides a structural foundation for further mechanistic studies as well as the clinical application of TRIM72.",

        "Title": "Less is more: balancing noise reduction and data retention in fMRI with data-driven scrubbing.",
        "Abstract": "Functional MRI (fMRI) data may be contaminated by artifacts arising from a myriad of sources, including subject head motion, respiration, heartbeat, scanner drift, and thermal noise. These artifacts cause deviations from common distributional assumptions, introduce spatial and temporal outliers, and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of the data-all of which can have negative consequences for the accuracy and power of downstream statistical analysis. Scrubbing is a technique for excluding fMRI volumes thought to be contaminated by artifacts and generally comes in two flavors. Motion scrubbing based on subject head motion-derived measures is popular but suffers from a number of drawbacks, among them the need to choose a threshold, a lack of generalizability to multiband acquisitions, and high rates of censoring of individual volumes and entire subjects. Alternatively, data-driven scrubbing methods like DVARS are based on observed noise in the processed fMRI timeseries and may avoid some of these issues. Here we propose \"projection scrubbing\", a novel data-driven scrubbing method based on a statistical outlier detection framework and strategic dimension reduction, including independent component analysis (ICA), to isolate artifactual variation. We undertake a comprehensive comparison of motion scrubbing with data-driven projection scrubbing and DVARS. We argue that an appropriate metric for the success of scrubbing is maximal data retention subject to reasonable performance on typical benchmarks such as the validity, reliability, and identifiability of functional connectivity. We find that stringent motion scrubbing yields worsened validity, worsened reliability, and produced small improvements to fingerprinting. Meanwhile, data-driven scrubbing methods tend to yield greater improvements to fingerprinting while not generally worsening validity or reliability. Importantly, however, data-driven scrubbing excludes a fraction of the number of volumes or entire sessions compared to motion scrubbing. The ability of data-driven fMRI scrubbing to improve data retention without negatively impacting the quality of downstream analysis has major implications for sample sizes in population neuroscience research.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) is a serious complication of type I and II diabetes. It develops from the initial microproteinuria to end-stage renal failure. The main initiator for DN is chronic hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia (HG) can stimulate the resident and non-resident renal cells to produce humoral mediators and cytokines that can lead to functional and phenotypic changes in renal cells and tissues, interference with cell growth, interacting proteins, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), etc., ultimately resulting in glomerular and tubular damage and the onset of kidney disease. Therefore, poor blood glucose control is a particularly important risk factor for the development of DN. In this paper, the types and mechanisms of DN cell damage are classified and summarized by reviewing the related literature concerning the effect of hyperglycemia on the development of DN. At the cellular level, we summarize the mechanisms and effects of renal damage by hyperglycemia. This is expected to provide therapeutic ideas and inspiration for further studies on the treatment of patients with DN.",

        "Abstract": "Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) were originally discovered in the bone marrow stroma. They are capable of self-renewal and multilineage differentiation into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and stromal cells. Importantly, these bone marrow SSCs localize in the perivascular region and highly express hematopoietic growth factors to create the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. Thus, bone marrow SSCs play pivotal roles in orchestrating osteogenesis and hematopoiesis. Besides the bone marrow, recent studies have uncovered diverse SSC populations in the growth plate, perichondrium, periosteum, and calvarial suture at different developmental stages, which exhibit distinct differentiation potential under homeostatic and stress conditions. Therefore, the current consensus is that a panel of region-specific SSCs collaborate to regulate skeletal development, maintenance, and regeneration. Here, we will summarize recent advances of SSCs in long bones and calvaria, with a special emphasis on the evolving concept and methodology in the field. We will also look into the future of this fascinating research area that may ultimately lead to effective treatment of skeletal disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Local feature matching is a part of many large vision tasks. Local feature matching usually consists of three parts: feature detection, description, and matching. The matching task usually serves a downstream task, such as camera pose estimation, so geometric information is crucial for the matching task. We propose the geometric feature embedding matching method (GFM) for local feature matching. We propose the adaptive keypoint geometric embedding module dynamic adjust keypoint position information and the orientation geometric embedding displayed modeling of geometric information about rotation. Subsequently, we interleave the use of self-attention and cross-attention for local feature enhancement. The predicted correspondences are multiplied by the local features. The correspondences are solved by computing dual-softmax. An intuitive human extraction and matching scheme is implemented. In order to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we performed validation on three datasets (MegaDepth, Hpatches, Aachen Day-Night v1.1) according to their respective metrics, and the results showed that our method achieved satisfactory results in all scenes.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, using semantic segmentation networks to distinguish dynamic and static key points has become a mainstream designing method for semantic SLAM systems. However, the semantic SLAM systems must have prior semantic knowledge of relevant dynamic objects, and their processing speed is inversely proportional to the recognition accuracy. To simultaneously enhance the speed and accuracy for recognizing dynamic objects in different environments, a novel SLAM system without prior semantics called DGFlow-SLAM is proposed in this paper. A novel grid segmentation method is used in the system to segment the scene flow, and then an adaptive threshold method is used to roughly detect the dynamic objects. Based on this, a deep mean clustering segmentation method is applied to find potential dynamic targets. Finally, the results of grid segmentation and depth mean clustering segmentation are jointly used to find moving objects accurately, and all the feature points of the moving objects are removed on the premise of retaining the static part of the moving object. The experimental results show that on the dynamic sequence dataset of TUM RGB-D, compared with the DynaSLAM system with the highest accuracy for detecting moderate and violent motion and the DS-SLAM with the highest accuracy for detecting slight motion, DGflow-SLAM obtains similar accuracy results and improves the accuracy by 7.5%. In addition, DGflow-SLAM is 10 times and 1.27 times faster than DynaSLAM and DS-SLAM, respectively.",

        "Title": "Identification of cuproptosis-related subtypes, cuproptosis-related gene prognostic index in hepatocellular carcinoma.",
        "Abstract": "Cuproptosis is a novel form of cell death, correlated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. However, the metabolic features and the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy based on cuproptosis have not yet been elucidated in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). First, we identified and validated three cuproptosis subtypes based on 10 cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in HCC patients. We explored the correlation between three cuproptosis subtypes and metabolism-related pathways. Besides, a comprehensive immune analysis of three cuproptosis subtypes was performed. Then, we calculated the cuproptosis-related gene prognostic index (CRGPI) score for predicting prognosis and validated its predictive capability by Decision curve analysis (DCA). We as well explored the benefit of ICI therapy of different CRGPI subgroups in two anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy cohorts (IMvigor210 cohort and GSE176307). Finally, we performed the ridge regression algorithm to calculate the IC50 value for drug sensitivity and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis to explore the potential mechanism. We found that cluster A presented a higher expression of FDX1 and was correlated with metabolism, glycolysis, and TCA cycle pathways, compared with the other two clusters. HCC patients with high CRGPI scores had a worse OS probability, and we further found that the CRGPI-high group had high expression of PD1/PDL1, TMB, and better response (PR/CR) to immunotherapy in the IMvigor210 cohort and GSE176307. These findings highlight the importance of CRGPI serving as a potential biomarker for both prognostic and immunotherapy for HCC patients. Generally, our results provide novel insights about cuproptosis into immune therapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising cancer treatment modality with advantages of minimal invasiveness, repeatable therapy, and mild systemic toxicity. However, the limited bioavailability of photosensitizer (PS), tumor hypoxia, and the presence of antiapoptotic proteins in cancer cells, has hampered the efficiency of PDT. To address these limitations, herein, we developed a hyaluronic acid (HA) based nanosystem (HA-Ce6-Hemin@DNA-Protamine NPs, HCH@DP) loaded with chlorin e6 (Ce6, as PS), hemin (as mimetic catalase) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) anti-apoptosis protein via a simple electrostatic self-assembly method for enhanced PDT of hypoxic solid tumors. The HCH@DP can target deliver the PS and ASO to tumor cells via cancer cell overexpressed HA receptors (i.e., CD44 or RHAMM). The Ce6 was released from HA-ss-Ce6 (HSC conjugates) after the reaction of cleavable disulfide bond with glutathione (GSH), which recovered the fluorescence and phototoxicity of Ce6 upon laser irradiation. Meanwhile, the catalase-mimicking hemin (degradation of HA-eda-hemin by hyaluronidase) decomposed the tumor overdressed endogenous H",

        "Abstract": "Protein lysine methylation is a significant protein post-translational modification (PTMs) and has a key function in epigenetic regulation. Protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMTs) mainly catalyzes the lysine methylation of various core histones and a few non-histone proteins. It has been observed that aberrant activity of PKMTs has been found in many cancers and other diseases, and some PKMT inhibitors have been discovered and progressed to clinical trials. This field developed rapidly and has aroused great interest. In this paper, we reviewed the biochemical and biological activities of PKMTs and their association with various cancers. Selective small-molecule inhibitors, including their chemical structure, structure-activity relationship, and in vitro/vivo studies, are also described to provide ideas for the discovery of highly potent, selective PKMT inhibitors.",

        "Abstract": "Single-beam super-resolution microscopy, also known as superlinear microscopy, exploits the nonlinear response of fluorescent probes in confocal microscopy. The technique requires no complex purpose-built system, light field modulation, or beam shaping. Here, we present a strategy to enhance this technique's spatial resolution by modulating excitation intensity during image acquisition. This modulation induces dynamic optical nonlinearity in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), resulting in variations of nonlinear fluorescence response in the obtained images. The higher orders of fluorescence response can be extracted with a proposed weighted finite difference imaging algorithm from raw fluorescence images to generate an image with higher resolution than superlinear microscopy images. We apply this approach to resolve single nanoparticles in a large area, improving the resolution to 132 nm. This work suggests a new scope for the development of dynamic nonlinear fluorescent probes in super-resolution nanoscopy.",

        "Abstract": "Most prostate cancers initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). With the long-term application of ADT, localized prostate cancer will progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), and the transcriptional network shifted. Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) may play a key role in this process through multiple mechanisms. To better understand the role of FOXA1 in prostate cancer, we review the interplay among FOXA1-targeted genes, modulators of FOXA1, and FOXA1 with a particular emphasis on androgen receptor (AR) function. Furthermore, we discuss the distinct role of FOXA1 mutations in prostate cancer and clinical significance of FOXA1. We summarize possible regulation pathways of FOXA1 in different stages of prostate cancer. We focus on links between FOXA1 and AR, which may play different roles in various types of prostate cancer. Finally, we discuss FOXA1 mutation and its clinical significance in prostate cancer. FOXA1 regulates the development of prostate cancer through various pathways, and it could be a biomarker for mCRPC and NEPC. Future efforts need to focus on mechanisms underlying mutation of FOXA1 in advanced prostate cancer. We believe that FOXA1 would be a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Light scattering from nanoparticles is significant in nanoscale imaging, photon confinement. and biosensing. However, engineering the scattering spectrum, traditionally by modifying the geometric feature of particles, requires synthesis and fabrication with nanometre accuracy. Here it is reported that doping lanthanide ions can engineer the scattering properties of low-refractive-index nanoparticles. When the excitation wavelength matches the ion resonance frequency of lanthanide ions, the polarizability and the resulted scattering cross-section of nanoparticles are dramatically enhanced. It is demonstrated that these purposely engineered nanoparticles can be used for interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy. Conceptually, a dual-modality iSCAT microscopy is further developed to identify different nanoparticle types in living HeLa cells. The work provides insight into engineering the scattering features by doping elements in nanomaterials, further inspiring exploration of the geometry-independent scattering modulation strategy.",

        "Title": "Transient brain-wide coactivations and structured transitions revealed in hemodynamic imaging data.",
        "Abstract": "Brain-wide patterns in resting human brains, as either structured functional connectivity (FC) or recurring brain states, have been widely studied in the neuroimaging literature. In particular, resting-state FCs estimated over windowed timeframe neuroimaging data from sub-minutes to minutes using correlation or blind source separation techniques have reported many brain-wide patterns of significant behavioral and disease correlates. The present pilot study utilized a novel whole-head cap-based high-density diffuse optical tomography (DOT) technology, together with data-driven analysis methods, to investigate recurring transient brain-wide patterns in spontaneous fluctuations of hemodynamic signals at the resolution of single timeframes from thirteen healthy adults in resting conditions. Our results report that a small number, i.e., six, of brain-wide coactivation patterns (CAPs) describe major spatiotemporal dynamics of spontaneous hemodynamic signals recorded by DOT. These CAPs represent recurring brain states, showing spatial topographies of hemispheric symmetry, and exhibit highly anticorrelated pairs. Moreover, a structured transition pattern among the six brain states is identified, where two CAPs with anterior-posterior spatial patterns are significantly involved in transitions among all brain states. Our results further elucidate two brain states of global positive and negative patterns, indicating transient neuronal coactivations and co-deactivations, respectively, over the entire cortex. We demonstrate that these two brain states are responsible for the generation of a subset of peaks and troughs in global signals (GS), supporting the recent reports on neuronal relevance of hemodynamic GS. Collectively, our results suggest that transient neuronal events (i.e., CAPs), global brain activity, and brain-wide structured transitions co-exist in humans and these phenomena are closely related, which extend the observations of similar neuronal events recently reported in animal hemodynamic data. Future studies on the quantitative relationship among these transient events and their relationships to windowed FCs along with larger sample size are needed to understand their changes with behaviors and diseased conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Human brains experience whole-brain anatomic and functional changes throughout the lifespan. Age-related whole-brain network changes have been studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine their low-frequency spatial and temporal characteristics. However, little is known about age-related changes in whole-brain fast dynamics at the scale of neuronal events. The present study investigated age-related whole-brain dynamics in resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 73 healthy participants from 6 to 65Â years old via characterizing transient neuronal coactivations at a resolution of tens of milliseconds. These uncovered transient patterns suggest fluctuating brain states at different energy levels of global activations. Our results indicate that with increasing age, shorter lifetimes and more occurrences were observed in the brain states that show the global high activations and more consecutive visits to the global highest-activation brain state. There were also reduced transitional steps during consecutive visits to the global lowest-activation brain state. These age-related effects suggest reduced stability and increased fluctuations when visiting high-energy brain states and with a bias toward staying low-energy brain states. These age-related whole-brain dynamics changes are further supported by changes observed in classic alpha and beta power, suggesting its promising applications in examining the effect of normal healthy brain aging, brain development, and brain disease.",

        "Abstract": "Spontaneous neural activity in human as assessed with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) exhibits brain-wide coordinated patterns in the frequency of Â <Â 0.1Â Hz. However, understanding of fast brain-wide networks at the timescales of neuronal events (milliseconds to sub-seconds) and their spatial, spectral, and transitional characteristics remain limited due to the temporal constraints of hemodynamic signals. With milli-second resolution and whole-head coverage, scalp-based electroencephalography (EEG) provides a unique window into brain-wide networks with neuronal-timescale dynamics, shedding light on the organizing principles of brain functions. Using the state-of-the-art signal processing techniques, we reconstructed cortical neural tomography from resting-state EEG and extracted component-based co-activation patterns (cCAPs). These cCAPs revealed brain-wide intrinsic networks and their dynamics, indicating the configuration/reconfiguration of resting human brains into recurring and transitional functional states, which are featured with the prominent spatial phenomena of global patterns and anti-state pairs of co-(de)activations. Rich oscillational structures across a wide frequency band (i.e., 0.6Â Hz, 5Â Hz, and 10Â Hz) were embedded in the nonstationary dynamics of these functional states. We further identified a superstructure that regulated between-state immediate and long-range transitions involving the entire set of identified cCAPs and governed a significant aspect of brain-wide network dynamics. These findings demonstrated how resting-state EEG data can be functionally decomposed using cCAPs to reveal rich dynamic structures of brain-wide human neural activations.",

        "Title": "MiR-106a facilitates the sensorineural hearing loss induced by oxidative stress by targeting connexin-43.",
        "Abstract": "Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a common clinical side effect resulted from the overusing of aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs, such as gentamicin. Oxidative stress is recently evidenced to be an important inducer for SNHL, which is reported to be associated with the knockdown of connexin-43. MiR-106a is recently found as a regulator of connexin-43. The present study aims to investigate whether miR-106a is a vital mediator in the development of SNHL. Firstly, upregulated miR-106a was observed in the peripheral blood sample of SNHL patients. Glucose oxidase (GO) was utilized to induce oxidative injury in isolated rat cochlear marginal cells (MCs), followed by introducing the miR-106a inhibitor. We found that the declined proliferation ability, increased apoptosis, and activated oxidative stress in GO-stimulated MCs were dramatically abolished by the miR-106a inhibitor, accompanied by the upregulation of connexin-43. The targeting correlation between miR-106a and connexin-43 was predicted and confirmed by the dual luciferase gene reporter assay. Furthermore, the regulatory effect of miR-106a inhibitor against the proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in GO-treated MCs were dramatically abolished by the knockdown of connexin-43. Gentamicin was utilized to establish the SNHL model in rats, followed by the treatments of antagomir-106a and antagomir-106a combined with carbenoxolone, an inhibitor of connexin-43. The alleviated pathological state, reduced apoptosis, and ameliorated oxidative stress in cochlea tissues were observed in antagomir-106a treated SNHL rats, which were dramatically reversed by the co-administration of carbenoxolone. Collectively, miR-106a facilitated the SNHL induced by oxidative stress via targeting connexin-43.",

        "Abstract": "The impact of green credit on banks has been widely verified. This paper systematically combs the internal mechanism of the impact of green credit on high-quality sustainable development of banks and studies the relationship between green credit and high-quality sustainable development of banks by using unbalanced panel data of Chinese listed banks from 2007 to 2019. The results show that green credit will significantly promote high-quality sustainable development of banks, which remains valid after controlling for relevant variables and robustness test. The further test results show that the impact of green credit on high-quality sustainable development of banks will be affected by green environment supervision and monetary policy. Green environment supervision and loose monetary policy promote the positive impact of green credit on high-quality sustainable development of banks. The heterogeneity test results show that the impact of green credit on high-quality sustainable development of banks is significantly different among banks with different business scope and different size, and the positive impact of green credit on high-quality sustainable development of small-scale banks and regional banks is more significant. This paper enriches the research of the impact of green credit on banks.",

        "Title": "Structural insights into Ras regulation by SIN1.",
        "Abstract": "Over the years it has been established that SIN1, a key component of mTORC2, could interact with Ras family small GTPases through its Ras-binding domain (RBD). The physical association of Ras and SIN1/mTORC2 could potentially affect both mTORC2 and Ras-ERK pathways. To decipher the precise molecular mechanism of this interaction, we determined the high-resolution structures of HRas/KRas-SIN1 RBD complexes, showing the detailed interaction interface. Mutation of critical interface residues abolished Ras-SIN1 interaction and in SIN1 knockout cells we demonstrated that Ras-SIN1 association promotes SGK1 activity but inhibits insulin-induced ERK activation. With structural comparison and competition fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays we showed that HRas-SIN1 RBD association is much weaker than HRas-Raf1 RBD but is slightly stronger than HRas-PI3K RBD interaction, providing a possible explanation for the different outcome of insulin or EGF stimulation. We also found that SIN1 isoform lacking the PH domain binds stronger to Ras than other longer isoforms and the PH domain appears to have an inhibitory effect on Ras-SIN1 binding. In addition, we uncovered a Ras dimerization interface that could be critical for Ras oligomerization. Our results advance our understanding of Ras-SIN1 association and crosstalk between growth factor-stimulated pathways.",

        "Abstract": "(1) Background: The panoramic view of a novel wide-band dielectric mapping system could show the individual anatomy. We aimed to compare the feasibility, efficacy and safety of the panoramic view guided approach for ablation of AVNRT with the conventional approach. (2) Methods: Ablation distributions in eight patients were retrospectively analyzed using the panoramic view. The para-slow-pathway (para-SP) region was divided into three regions, and the region that most frequently appeared with the appropriate junctional rhythm or eliminated the slow-pathway was defined as the adaptive slow-pathway (aSP) region. Twenty patients with AVNRT were then ablated in the aSP region under the panoramic view and compared with 40 patients using the conventional approach. (3) Results: Thirty ablation points were analyzed. The majority of effective points (95.0%) were located in the inferior and anterior portions of the para-SP region and defined as the aSP region. Baseline characteristics, fluoroscopic duration, and mean number of ablations were similar among the two groups. The panoramic view group had a significantly higher percentage of appropriate junctional rhythm (81.9% Â± 26.0% vs. 55.7% Â± 30.5%, ",

        "Abstract": "Recently, molecules with aggregation-induced luminescence (AIE) characteristics have received more and more attention due to the fluorescence of traditional dyes being easily quenched in the aggregated state. AIE molecules have significant advantages, such as excellent light stability, bright fluorescence, high contrast, and large Stokes shift. These characteristics have aroused wide interest of researchers and opened up new applications in many fields, especially in the field of biological applications. However, AIE molecules or their aggregates have certain limitations in multifunctional biological research due to their low specific targeting ability, poor biocompatibility, and poor stability in physiological body fluids. In order to overcome these problems, a novel nanoparticle, FFM1, was fabricated and characterized. FFM1 displayed good water solubility, biocompatibility, and AIE emission properties. It could target HeLa cells specifically by recognizing their folate receptor. Reactive oxygen triggered by light irradiation induced tumor cell apoptosis. Summarily, FFM1 displayed excellent capacity in target imaging and photodynamic killing of HeLa cells. It has shown potential application value in targeted diagnosis and photodynamic therapy of tumors, and has important guiding significance for the treatment of malignant tumors. It paves a way for the development of a novel strategy for tumor theranostics.",

        "Abstract": "Distinguishing bipolar depression (BD) from unipolar depression (UD) based on symptoms only is challenging. Brain functional connectivity (FC), especially dynamic FC, has emerged as a promising approach to identify possible imaging markers for differentiating BD from UD. However, most of such studies utilized conventional FC and group-level statistical comparisons, which may not be sensitive enough to quantify subtle changes in the FC dynamics between BD and UD. In this paper, we present a more effective individualized differentiation model based on machine learning and the whole-brain \"high-order functional connectivity (HOFC)\" network. The HOFC, capturing temporal synchronization among the dynamic FC time series, a more complex \"chronnectome\" metric compared to the conventional FC, was used to classify 52 BD, 73 UD, and 76 healthycontrols (HC). We achieved a satisfactory accuracy (70.40%) in BD vs. UD differentiation. The resultant contributing features revealed the involvement of the coordinated flexible interactions among sensory (e.g., olfaction, vision, and audition), motor, and cognitive systems. Despite sharing common chronnectome of cognitive and affective impairments, BD and UD also demonstrated unique dynamic FC synchronization patterns. UD is more associated with abnormal visual-somatomotor inter-network connections, while BD is more related to impaired ventral attention-frontoparietal inter-network connections. Moreover, we found that the illness duration modulated the BD vs. UD separation, with the differentiation performance hampered by the secondary disease effects. Our findings suggest that BD and UD may have divergent and convergent neural substrates, which further expand our knowledge of the two different mental disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Arsenic and antimony are common toxic metalloids found in associated minerals. These metalloids generally cause high-concentration pollution in non-ferrous metal smelting soils; however, few studies have investigated the pollution characteristics of these two metalloids at non-ferrous smelting sites using varying soil particle sizes. In this study, the valency distributions and geochemical fractions were investigated with varying soil particle sizes (â¤ 0.05, 0.05-0.25, 0.25-1, and 1-2Â mm). Soils were mainly concentrated in â¤Â 0.05 and 0.05-0.25Â mm with mass percentages of 32.97% and 29.02%, respectively. The highest total As and Sb concentrations in â¤Â 0.05Â mm were found to be 20,350 and 3655Â mg/kg, respectively. In addition, As(â¢), As(â¤), Sb(â¢), and Sb(â¤) concentrations in this soil particle size were found to be 224, 19,813, 1036, and 24Â mg/kg, respectively. The geochemical fractions of As and Sb in varying soil particle sizes were mainly residual, accounting for 50% and 90% in the â¤Â 0.05Â mm. Soil may bind â¤Â 0.25Â mm due to the disparity found in the geochemical compositions and valency distributions of arsenic and antimony. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive system analysis confirmed that arsenolite accumulated in particle sizes of â¤Â 0.05 and 0.05-0.25Â mm. The results of this study may provide a scientific reference for risk assessment and restoration strategies for non-ferrous metal smelting soils.",

Herein, we develop a magnetically responsive Ni/CuNi nanoparticle (NP) decoration of Cu-based composites that could serve as recoverable nanocatalysts for nitroaromatics reduction. The nanocatalysts consist of an inner copper core and abundant tiny satellite Ni/CuNi NPs, which are tightly combined as a stable whole part by a silica interlayer and a carbon outer layer. In addition to the high catalytic activity, the outer Ni/CuNi NPs exhibit a strong magnetic response toward the external magnetic field, thereby offering a convenient way to separate the composites from the reaction solution. Moreover, characterization results reveal that high annealing temperature (above 700 Â°C) favors the construction of yolk-shell nanostructures and the formation of outer bimetallic CuNi NPs. As a result, owing to the excellent catalytic performance of the Cu inner cores, the high coverage of outer Ni or CuNi NPs, and the unique sandwich-like structure, the resultant Cu@SiO",

        "Title": "Exploring the potential role of environmental and multi-source satellite data in crop yield prediction across Northeast China.",
        "Abstract": "Developing an accurate crop yield predicting system at a large scale is of paramount importance for agricultural resource management and global food security. Earth observation provides a unique source of information to monitor crops from a diversity of spectral ranges. However, the integrated use of these data and their values in crop yield prediction is still understudied. Here we proposed the combination of environmental data (climate, soil, geography, and topography) with multiple satellite data (optical-based vegetation indices, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature (LST), and microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD)) into the framework to estimate crop yield for maize, rice, and soybean in northeast China, and their unique value and relative influence on yield prediction was assessed. Two linear regression methods, three machine learning (ML) methods, and one ML ensemble model were adopted to build yield prediction models. Results showed that the individual ML methods outperformed the linear regression methods, the ML ensemble model further improved the single ML models. Moreover, models with more inputs achieved better performance, the combination of satellite data with environmental data, which explained 72%, 69%, and 57% of maize, rice, and soybean yield variability, respectively, demonstrated higher yield prediction performance than individual inputs. While satellite data contributed to crop yield prediction mainly at the early-peak of the growing season, climate data offered extra information mainly at the peak-late season. We also found that the combined use of EVI, LST and SIF has improved the model accuracy compared to the benchmark EVI model. However, the optical-based vegetation indices shared similar information and did not provide much extra information beyond EVI. The within-season yield forecasting showed that crop yields can be satisfactorily forecasted at two to three months prior to harvest. Geography, topography, VOD, EVI, soil hydraulic and nutrient parameters are more important for crop yield prediction.",

        "Title": "Regulating the Entire Journey of Pesticide Application on Surfaces of Hydrophobic Leaves Modified by Pathogens at Different Growth Stages.",
        "Abstract": "Under the background of the strategy of reducing pesticide application and increasing efficiency, the mechanism and common technology of efficient and accurate target deposition of chemical pesticides are the key development direction. The interaction between pesticide droplets and a leaf surface affects the deposition behavior of pesticides. However, cucumber leaf surface modified by powdery mildew pathogens at different growth stages is more hydrophobic than a normal leaf surface, which hinders the accurate deposition of pesticides on cucumber powdery mildew leaves. Here, an effective strategy for controlling pesticide efficiency for the entire journey of pesticide application is proposed. Based on the impact dynamics of droplets, the dynamic direction of droplet bounce is determined, the trajectory of droplet rebound is preliminarily determined, and the pinning sites formed by droplets on the surface of cucumber leaves with powdery mildew are confirmed. By analyzing the dynamics in the retraction stage and the energy dissipation rate for droplets after impact, the basic parameters that can be used to simply characterize droplet rebound are screened out, and the effect of addition of an effective surfactant is determined by characterizing the basic parameters (energy dissipation rate, retraction rate, recovery coefficient). The molecular structure formed by the addition of nonionic surfactant in pesticide solution is more appropriate to the interaction between the powdery mildew layer and the pesticide solution, which ensured that the droplets are well wet and deposited on cucumber powdery mildew leaves. Meanwhile, a force balance model for the pesticide droplet wetting state is established to calculate the pinning force for the droplet and predict the transition direction for the droplet wetting state. Impact dynamics combined with force balance model analysis provides a constructive method to improve pesticide utilization during the entire journey for pesticide application on hydrophobic plant surfaces.",

        "Abstract": "Building extraction in VHR RSIs remains a challenging task due to occlusion and boundary ambiguity problems. Although conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based methods are capable of exploiting local texture and context information, they fail to capture the shape patterns of buildings, which is a necessary constraint in the human recognition. To address this issue, we propose an adversarial shape learning network (ASLNet) to model the building shape patterns that improve the accuracy of building segmentation. In the proposed ASLNet, we introduce the adversarial learning strategy to explicitly model the shape constraints, as well as a CNN shape regularizer to strengthen the embedding of shape features. To assess the geometric accuracy of building segmentation results, we introduced several object-based quality assessment metrics. Experiments on two open benchmark datasets show that the proposed ASLNet improves both the pixel-based accuracy and the object-based quality measurements by a large margin.

        "Abstract": "Diffuse optical tomography (DOT), based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy, is a portable, low-cost, noninvasive functional neuroimaging technology for studying the human brain in normal and diseased conditions. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the performance of a cap-based brain-wide DOT (BW-DOT) framework in mapping brain-wide networked activities. We first analyzed point-spread-function (PSF)-based metrics on a realistic head geometry. Our simulation results indicated that these metrics of the optode cap varied across the brain and were of lower quality in brain areas deep or away from the optodes. We further reconstructed brain-wide resting-state networks using experimental data from healthy participants, which resembled the template networks established in the fMRI literature. The preliminary results of the present study highlight the importance of evaluating PSF-based metrics on realistic head geometries for DOT and suggest that BW-DOT technology is a promising functional neuroimaging tool for studying brain-wide neural activities and large-scale neural networks, which was not available by patch-based DOT. A full-scope evaluation and validation in more realistic head models and more participants are needed in the future to establish the findings of the present study further.Clinical relevance- Via simulations and experimental evaluation, this work establishes a novel framework to image large-scale brain networks, which benefits the patient population, such as bedridden patients, infants, etc., who otherwise cannot undergo conventional brain monitoring modalities like fMRI and PET.",

The structure-based synthesis and biological evaluation of 5,6-dihydrobenzo[h]quinazoline derivatives as FLT3 inhibitors have been studied in this paper. III-1a, III-1c, III-2a, III-2c, and III-4a displayed comparable inhibitory potency against FLT3-ITD and showed remarkable antiproliferative activities against MV4-11.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) and colon cancer (CRC) are the two most deadly cancers in the world. These cancers partly share the same genetic background and are partially regulated by the same genes. The outcomes of traditional chemoradiotherapy and surgery remain suboptimal, with high postoperative recurrence and a low survival rate. It is, therefore, urgent to innovate and improve the existing treatment measures. Many studies primarily reported that the microRNA (miRNA) sponge functions of circular RNA (circRNA) in BC and CRC have an indirect relationship between the circRNA-miRNA axis and malignant behaviors. With a covalent ring structure, circRNAs can regulate the expression of target genes in multiple ways, especially by acting as miRNA sponges. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the roles of circRNAs as miRNA sponges in BC and CRC based on studies over the last three years, thus providing a theoretical reference for finding new therapeutic targets in the future.",

        "Abstract": "In order to effectively analyze and explore the socio-economic impact of haze pollution, the article constructs a comprehensive two-stage decomposition model to verify that technological progress plays a key role in controlling haze pollution. And for the first time, a macro-level research framework for the rebound effect of haze pollution has been constructed to compare and analyze the heterogeneity of the rebound effect of technological progress in different industries in different regions. The study found that (1) during the period 2000-2017, haze pollution situation deteriorated. Economic effects were the main reasons for haze pollution. Among these effects, technological progress was the main driving force for haze control, followed by the emission intensity during 2000-2011 and the reduction of industrial structure since 2014. (2) The significant drive of emission reduction is in the secondary industry, showing a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. Besides, there was a difference in spatial distribution, which shows an increased trend from east to west. (3) The rebound effect of haze pollution at the macro level in China presented high-level fluctuations, and there were certain spatial distribution differences. However, due to the convergence of technological development stages, regional differences have a gradual convergence trend. In the future, in the process of haze control, it is necessary to increase support for technological innovation, implement energy total control and price reform, promote technological progress, and implement differentiated haze reduction policies to solve problems according to local conditions.",

        "Abstract": "The hypoxia-activated and nitroreductase-responsive phototheranostic probe has been developed by incorporating a nitro group into a hemicyanine fluorophore. The probe displays extremely sensitive and selective near-infrared fluorescence enhancement to nitroreductase with the detection limit of 2.10Â ng/mL. The detection mechanism relies on the nitroreductase-catalyzed reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, along with the generation of the fluorophore. The availability of the probe in fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy was demonstrated at cellular level and in vivo. The probe can image endogenous nitroreductase and the hypoxia status of living cells. The probe also exhibits significant phototoxicity to hypoxia tumor cells under the 660Â nm laser irradiation. More importantly, the probe has been successfully utilized in imaging tiny tumor (about 6Â mm",

        "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma is a highly aggressive cancer common in children and adolescents. There is still a lack of effective treatments for metastatic or recurrent osteosarcoma. The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in osteosarcoma has gradually attracted attention. Here, we identified lncRNAs that were abnormally expressed in metastatic osteosarcoma through analyzing the sequencing data of osteosarcoma tissues and selected upregulated lncRNA MELTF-AS1 for detailed study.Â The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of MELTF-AS1 was increased in osteosarcoma tissues and cells, and the high expression of MELTF-AS1 indicated a poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. The high expression of MELTF-AS1 in osteosarcoma was partly due to the transcriptional activation of RREB1. The results of transwell assays, scratch wound healing assays, and the tail vein injection lung metastasis model demonstrated that knocking down MELTF-AS1 inhibited metastasis ability of osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, the results of RNA pull-down assays, luciferase reporter assays, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays revealed that MELTF-AS1 could regulate MMP14 expression through interaction with miR-485-5p. Our study suggested that MELTF-AS1 functioned as a pro-metastasis gene in osteosarcoma by upregulating MMP14 and that it couldÂ be a potential therapeutic and diagnostic target for osteosarcoma.",

        "Abstract": "Hydrophobic surfaces modified by pathogens in agricultural production are one of the main reasons to reduce the utilization of pesticides. Adding surfactants to pesticide solutions is a common method to improve their wetting and spreading properties. In this work, the interaction mechanism between pathogen-modified hydrophobic surfaces and mixtures of surfactants and a pesticide was studied in detail. The interaction mechanism was determined by characterizing the wetting and spreading behaviors of droplets on cucumber powdery mildew leaves at different growth stages. When surfactants were added, droplets on cucumber powdery mildew leaves were in the Wenzel wetting state, the pinning force weakened, the contact line speed accelerated, and the adhesion force increased. We explained the micellar state and aggregation behavior of surfactant molecules in a pesticide solution that was applied to the surface of cucumber powdery mildew leaves. Droplets of solutions containing nonionic surfactants easily formed semibald micelles, binding to the pathogen of powdery mildew, whereas droplets containing cationic surfactants did not do so. Because of the electrostatic interaction between cationic surfactant molecules and powdery mildew pathogens, cationic surfactant molecules did not wet the pathogens very well, so we suggest adding nonionic surfactants rather than cationic surfactants to improve the wetting and spreading of pesticide solutions on cucumber powdery mildew leaves. This study provides new insights into enhancing the wetting and deposition of droplets on pathogen-modified hydrophobic surfaces.",

        "Abstract": "The quality inspection of micro solder joints in laser spot welding (LSW) is a problem of great concern in industrial application. In this paper, a laser ultrasonic technology (LUT) was proposed to inspect the quality of micro solder joints in LSW. Firstly, based on the thermoelastic model of acoustic wave propagation in solid, a theoretical model was built and used to analyze the propagation properties of the Lamb wave in the whole field by finite element method (FEM), the transmitting properties of the excited Lamb wave via solder joint were affected by the effective contacted area of solder joint. Secondly, LUT was used to inspect the 1.2â¯mm/0.4â¯mm welding spot of standard/false 304 stainless steel welded components. By comparing the propagating properties of excited ultrasonic wave in different samples with different weld quality, the standard and false welding can be visually distinguished. Finally, a industrial CT was used to check the quality of the samples used in our experiment. Inclusions and pores have been found in the false solder joints, which will reduce the effective contacted area of solder joint, and then affected the propagation of ultrasonic wave. By combining the CT results and the experimental analysis, the experimental results detected by LUT are in good agreement with the simulation results. So, the LUT is a potential method in field of the quality inspection of micro solder joints in LSW.",

In this study, we analyzed chlorinated paraffins (CPs) in foodstuff samples (551 pooled samples, 93 items) divided into eight categories collected from Jinan, Shandong Province of China, by atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (APCI-qToF-MS), to investigate the occurrence, contamination patterns and homologue patterns of LCCPs in foodstuff commonly consumed in traditional Chinese diet. LCCP intake through diet was estimated as well. LCCPs were detected in all pooled samples with geometric mean (GM) concentrations ranging from 1.8 to 21.9Â ng/g wet weight (ng/g ww), contributing to 9-28% of the total CP mass in the studied foodstuff categories. The contamination patterns of LCCPs differed from SCCPs and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs), as reflected by the patterns of mass distribution, and by the lack of correlations between LCCP and S/MCCP concentrations in various foodstuff categories. The homologue profiles of LCCPs were extremely complex and diverse, with frequent detection of C",

        "Abstract": "The bone marrow niche plays critical roles in hematopoietic recovery and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regeneration after myeloablative stress. However, it is not clear whether systemic factors beyond the local niche are required for these essential processes in vivo. Thrombopoietin (THPO) is a key cytokine promoting hematopoietic rebound after myeloablation and its transcripts are expressed by multiple cellular sources. The upregulation of bone marrow-derived THPO has been proposed to be crucial for hematopoietic recovery and HSC regeneration after stress. Nonetheless, the cellular source of THPO in myeloablative stress has never been investigated genetically. We assessed the functional sources of THPO following two common myeloablative perturbations: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administration and irradiation. Using a ",

        "Abstract": "With the widespread use of PD-1/PD-L1Â monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the treatment of multiple malignant tumors, they were also gradually applied to advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). Nowadays, multiple PD-1/PD-L1Â mAbs, such as nivolumab, avelumab, and pembrolizumab, have achieved considerable efficacy in clinical trials. However, due to the primary, adaptive, and acquired resistance to these mAbs, the efficacy of this immunotherapy is not satisfactory. Theories also vary as to why the difference in efficacy occurs. The alterations of PD-L1 expression and the interference of cellular immunity may affect the efficacy. These mechanisms demand to be revealed to achieve a sustained and complete objective response in patients with aRCC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been proven to have synergistic mechanisms with PD-1/PD-L1Â mAb in the treatment of aRCC, and CTLA-4Â mAb has been shown to have a non-redundant effect with PD-1/PD-L1Â mAb to enhance efficacy. Although combinations with targeted agents or other checkpoint mAbs have yielded enhanced clinical outcomes in multiple clinical trials nowadays, the potential of PD-1/PD-L1Â mAbs still has a large development space. More potential mechanisms that affect the efficacy demand to be developed and transformed into the clinical treatment of aRCC to search for possible combination regimens. We elucidate these mechanisms in RCC and present existing combination therapies applied in clinical trials. This may help physicians' select treatment options for patients with refractory kidney cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The deposition and retention of pesticide sprays on the surface of hydrophobic plant leaves is a major agricultural challenge, and the deposition of hydrophobic surfaces caused by plant leaf diseases is also a major agricultural problem. Many recent studies have focused on evaluating the effect of adding surfactants to water rather than to pesticide solutions to increase the deposition and retention of spray liquids. Here, we report a strategy to solve the problem of deposition and retention by studying the impact of the behavior of pesticide droplets with added surfactants and performing kinetic analysis on cucumber leaves with powdery mildew. The reduction in the bounce and splash of the pesticide droplets was analyzed by combining the pinning site formed in the retraction stage and the viscous dissipation in the rebound stage. In the practical application of the pesticide spray, we can clearly see that the bounce, splash, and powdery mildew spore ejection decreased when surfactants were added to the pesticide spray that was used on the cucumber leaves, and the adhesion and retention increased. The proposed comprehensive method is helpful for understanding the interactions between pesticide spray droplets and the surface of cucumber leaves with powdery mildew.",

In this report, we present a case of a 62-year-old male with abdominal pain and slightly elevated alpha-fetoprotein. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans showed a left liver mass, which showed adherence to the imaging characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, with the treatment of laparoscopic liver resection, the following histological examination displayed two distinct components, which were consistent with the diagnosis of cHCC-CC.",

As key regulators of various biological processes, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been verified as crucial factors in NSCLC. To elucidate the role of miR-486-5p in the mTOR pathway, we investigated its role in NSCLC and related signaling.

        "Abstract": "Intestinal epithelial barrier protects intestine from infection and injury, while chronic inflammation is a trigger for tumorigenesis. As a member of tight junctions (TJs) family, Claudin-7 (Cldn-7) is dedicated to maintaining cell polarity and TJs barrier integrity, and closely related to the development of inflammation and tumors. However, potential roles of Cldn-7 in intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) have not been well characterized in vivo. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of Cldn-7 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and CAC. Colitis and colitis-cancer transformation models were established based on inducible intestinal conditional Cldn-7 gene knockout mice (Cldn7fl/fl;villin-CreERT2), by intraperitoneal injection of azomethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) feeding. Cldn-7 knockout promoted susceptibility to colitis and CAC, aggravated clinical symptoms, severely damaged intestinal epithelium, increased mucosal inflammation accompanied dysregulated cell proliferation-apoptosis. Epithelial barrier integrity was destroyed, and intercellular permeability was increased. After AOM/DSS induction, tumor burden and volume were increased, characterized by enhanced proliferation and activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Mechanistically, Cldn-7 deficiency promoted colitis and subsequently malignant transformation by destroying TJs integrity and increasing inflammatory cascade. Overall, based on Cldn-7 knockout mouse model, we have first demonstrated the key roles of Cldn-7 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and preventing IBD and consequent CAC. ",

Herein, an easy and fast one-step electrodeposition process is developed to fabricate W-doped NiFe (NiFeW)-layered double hydroxides with ultrathin nanosheet features at room temperature and ambient pressure as bifunctional catalysts for water splitting. Notably, the NiFeW nanosheets require overpotentials of only 239 and 115 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm",

        "Title": "Neuroimaging Markers of Mal de DÃ©barquement Syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Mal de dÃ©barquement syndrome (MdDS) is a motion-induced disorder of oscillating vertigo that persists after the motion has ceased. The neuroimaging characteristics of the MdDS brain state have been investigated with studies on brain metabolism, structure, functional connectivity, and measurements of synchronicity. Baseline metabolism and resting-state functional connectivity studies indicate that a limbic focus in the left entorhinal cortex and amygdala may be important in the pathology of MdDS, as these structures are hypermetabolic in MdDS and exhibit increased functional connectivity to posterior sensory processing areas and reduced connectivity to the frontal and temporal cortices. Both structures are tunable with periodic stimulation, with neurons in the entorhinal cortex required for spatial navigation, acting as a critical efferent pathway to the hippocampus, and sending and receiving projections from much of the neocortex. Voxel-based morphometry measurements have revealed volume differences between MdDS and healthy controls in hubs of multiple resting-state networks including the default mode, salience, and executive control networks. In particular, volume in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices decreases and volume in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri/anterior insulas increases with longer duration of illness. Paired with noninvasive neuromodulation interventions, functional neuroimaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and simultaneous fMRI-EEG have shown changes in resting-state functional connectivity that correlate with symptom modulation, particularly in the posterior default mode network. Reduced parieto-occipital connectivity with the entorhinal cortex and reduced long-range fronto-parieto-occipital connectivity correlate with symptom improvement. Though there is a general theme of desynchronization correlating with reduced MdDS symptoms, the prediction of optimal stimulation parameters for noninvasive brain stimulation in individuals with MdDS remains a challenge due to the large parameter space. However, the pairing of functional neuroimaging and noninvasive brain stimulation can serve as a probe into the biological underpinnings of MdDS and iteratively lead to optimal parameter space identification.",

        "Title": "Comparative Efficacy and Safety of PARP Inhibitors as Maintenance Therapy in Platinum Sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer: A Network Meta-Analysis.",
        "Abstract": "This meta-analysis investigated the comparative efficacy and safety of PARP inhibitor monotherapy as maintenance treatment in platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC). Electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant RCTs. The primary endpoint was PFS. The results were stratified based on three categories: BRCA mutated patients, HRD patients, and overall population. The secondary outcome were discontinuations due to adverse events and grade 3 or 4 adverse events in maintenance phase. Five eligible RCTs were included in the network meta-analysis. For patients with BRCA mutated ovarian cancer, olaparib-throughout (HR = 0.21 with 95% CrI: 0.081-0.55), rucaparib (HR = 0.23 with 95% CrI: 0.16-0.34), olaparib (HR = 0.27 with 95% CrI: 0.20-0.35), and niraparib (HR = 0.26 with 95% CrI: 0.17-0.41) were all highly effective in comparison with placebo at improving PFS. For HRD patients, both rucaparib (HR = 0.32 with 95% CrI: 0.24-0.42) and niraparib (HR = 0.38 with 95% CrI: 0.24-0.60) were all highly effective in comparison with placebo at improving PFS. For the overall population, olaparib-throughout (HR = 0.51 with 95% CrI: 0.34-0.76), rucaparib (HR = 0.37 with 95% CrI: 0.30-0.45), olaparib (HR = 0.35 with 95% CrI: 0.25-0.49), and niraparib (HR = 0.38 with 95% CrI: 0.30-0.48) were all highly effective in comparison with placebo at improving PFS. Regarding grade 3 or 4 adverse events, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity reactions to rucaparib and niraparib were significantly higher than in the olaparib group. In terms of discontinuations due to adverse events, the treatment discontinuations were not significantly different between the three drugs. In summary, all the included maintenance treatment regimens are effective regardless of BRCA mutational status, and no statistically significant differences between rucaparib, niraparib and Olaparib in terms of PFS. In terms of safety profile, the three drugs present manageable adverse events. Clinicians should consider potential adverse events related to each of these interventions in clinical practice, and the adverse events are generally manageable.",

        "Title": "Triplet Fusion Upconversion with Oxygen Resistance in Aqueous Media.",
        "Abstract": "Triplet fusion upconversion (also called triplet-triplet annihilation, TTA) arouses much attention due to its potential in the fields of biological imaging, optogenetics, and light harvesting. However, oxygen quenching remains a challenge ahead, restricting its applications in aqueous media. Previous efforts to realize aqueous TTA with oxygen resistance have been focused on core-shell structures and self-assembly, but tedious processes and complicated chemical modification are required. Here, we report a direct and efficient strategy to realize aqueous TTA by controlling the ionic equilibrium of the TTA dyad. We find that the ionized organic dyad in physiological buffers and electrolyte-based media shows a natural aerotolerance without any complicated structure engineering. In particular, the upconversion intensity of this aqueous TTA in Tris buffer under an air-saturated condition is more than twice that under the deaerated condition. We further demonstrate the TTA system for potential applications in pH and temperature sensing with reversible and sensitive performance. We anticipate this facile approach will inspire the development of practical aqueous TTA and broad applications in biological science.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one kind of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, owing to its insidious symptoms, early metastases, and negative responses to current therapies. With an increasing understanding of pathology, the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a significant role in ineffective treatment and poor prognosis of PC. Thus, a growing number of studies have focused on whether components of the TME could be effective targets for PC therapy. Biomaterials have been widely applied in cancer therapy, and numerous organic or inorganic biomaterials for TME regulation have been developed to inhibit the growth and metastasis of PC, as well as reverse therapeutic resistance. In this review, we discuss various biomaterials utilized to treat PC based on different components of the TME, including, but not limited to, extracellular matrix (ECM), abnormal tumor vascularization, and tumor-associated immune cells, as well as other unconventional therapeutic strategies. Besides, the perspectives on the underlying future of theranostic nanomedicines for PC therapy are also presented.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, integration of self-healing, color-tunable, sol-gel converted properties into hydrogel has attracted interest for preparing a reinforced multifunctional hydrogel. Herein, acidochromic regenerated cellulose (ARC) was incorporated into the polyvinyl alcohol/borax (PB) matrix for constructing a tough, self-healing, multicolor and sol-gel converted smart hydrogel (PB/ARC). The mechanical properties of PB/ARC hydrogel were improved after introducing ARC, which could bear a weight of 200 g and had high maximum tensile strength (6.8 times) and compressive strength (2.3 times). PB/ARC hydrogel automatically fused within 15 s after being cut and quickly recovered to the original state after being subjected to high shear strain, showing excellent self-healing ability. The color of hydrogel could be tuned between yellow and purple by altering pH values (5-12). In addition, PB/ARC hydrogel exhibited reversible sol-gel conversion in response to the change of acidity and alkalinity. This study offers a new and facile strategy for developing multifunctional smart hydrogel.",

        "Title": "Sappanone A Protects Against Inflammation, Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis in Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Alleviating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.",
        "Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress is an important contributor to the cerebral ischemic injury. Sappanone A (SA), a kind of natural homoisoflavanone extracted from Caesalpinia sappan L, has been evidenced to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The present study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of SA in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The potential neuroprotective effect of SA was tested in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) allowing reperfusion and PC12 cell model of oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R). Post-ischemic neuronal injury was evaluated by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress-related markers were detected using corresponding kits. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) or flow cytometry, and the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was determined using western blot analysis. Subsequently, endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins were detected through western blot analysis, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) was overexpressed to confirm the contribution of endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibition by SA to the neuroprotective effects post OGD/R. Results revealed that SA was effective in ameliorating cerebral infarction and pathological injuries post-reperfusion following MCAO, which is associated with reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis by SA in the brain. Consistently, these neuroprotective effects of SA post ischemia-reperfusion were also observed in a PC12 cell model of OGD/R. Importantly, endoplasmic reticulum stressors, including the CHOP, the 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factors 2Î± (EIF-2Î±), were significantly downregulated by SA, while CHOP overexpression attenuated the beneficial effects of SA on inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in OGD/R-induced PC12 cells. These results demonstrated that SA alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress, ameliorating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, and thereby serves as therapeutic potential for protection against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in ischemic stroke.",

        "Abstract": "Autophagy programs the metabolic and functional fitness of regulatory T (T reg) cells to establish immune tolerance, yet the mechanisms governing autophagy initiation in T reg cells remain unclear. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZFP91 facilitates autophagy activation to sustain T reg cell metabolic programming and functional integrity. T reg cell-specific deletion of Zfp91 caused T reg cell dysfunction and exacerbated colonic inflammation and inflammation-driven colon carcinogenesis. TCR-triggered autophagy induction largely relied on T reg cell-derived ZFP91 to restrict hyperglycolysis, which is required for the maintenance of T reg cell homeostasis. Mechanistically, ZFP91 rapidly translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TCR stimulation and then mediated BECN1 ubiquitination to promote BECN1-PIK3C3 complex formation. Therefore, our results highlight a ZFP91-dependent mechanism promoting TCR-initiated autophagosome maturation to maintain T reg cell homeostasis and function.",

        "Abstract": "LLKL, a new traditional Chinese medicine formula containing Edgeworthia gardneri (Wall.) Meisn., Sibiraea angustata and Crocus sativus L. (saffron), was designed to ameliorate type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite the therapeutic benefits of LLKL, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study evaluated the LLKL anti-diabetic efficacy and its effect on gut microbiota to elucidate its mechanism of action in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. We found that administration of different LLKL concentrations (4.68, 2.34 and 1.17Â g/kg/d) improved several diabetic parameters after a 6-week treatment. Moreover, LLKL modulated gut microbiota dysbiosis, increased the expression of occluding and maintained intestinal epithelial homeostasis, leading to a reduction in LPS, TNF-Î± and IL-6 levels. Hepatic transcriptomic analysis showed that the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway was markedly enriched by LLKL treatment. RT-qPCR results validated that LLKL treatment decreased the expressions of TLR4, MyD88 and CTSK. Furthermore, a gene set enrichment analysis indicated that LLKL enhanced the insulin signalling pathway and inhibited glycerolipid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, which were verified by the liver biochemical analysis. These findings demonstrate that LLKL ameliorates hyperglycaemia, modulates the gut microbiota and regulates the gut-liver axis, which might contribute to its anti-diabetic effect.",

        "Abstract": "The BES1/BZR1 transcription factors regulate the expression of genes responsive to brassinosteroids and play pivotal roles in plant development, but their role in regulating kernel development in maize remains unclear. In this study, we found that ZmBES1/BZR1-5 positively regulates kernel size. Association analysis of candidate genes in 513 diverse maize inbred lines indicated that three SNPs related to ZmBES1/BZR1-5 were significantly associated with kernel width and whilst four SNPs were related to 100-kernel weight. Overexpression of ZmBES1/BZR1-5 in Arabidopsis and rice both significantly increased seed size and weight, and smaller kernels were produced in maize Mu transposon insertion and EMS mutants. The ZmBES1/BZR1-5 protein locates in the nucleus, contains bHLH and BAM domains, and shows no transcriptional activity as a monomer but forms a homodimer through the BAM domain. ChIP-sequencing analysis, and yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays demonstrated that the protein binds to the promoters of AP2/EREBP genes (Zm00001d010676 and Zm00001d032077) and inhibits their transcription. cDNA library screening showed that ZmBES1/BZR1-5 interacts with casein kinase II subunit Î²4 (ZmCKIIÎ²4) and ferredoxin 2 (ZmFdx2) in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Taken together, our study suggests that ZmBES1/BZR1-5 positively regulates kernel size, and provides new insights into understanding the mechanisms of kernel development in maize.",

        "Abstract": "High tibial osteotomy (HTO) has a history of nearly 60âyears and has been widely used in clinical practice. Biplanar open wedge high tibial osteotomy (BOWHTO), which evolved from HTO, is an important therapy for the knee osteoarthritis. In our previous research, we found that the decrease of hemoglobin levels after high tibial osteotomy ranges from between 17 to 41âg/L, but this is highly inconsistent with the intraoperative bleeding and postoperative drainage observed in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perioperative hidden blood loss (HBL) after biplanar open wedge high tibial osteotomy (BOWHTO), as well as to study the effect of the actual correction angle on blood loss.",

Here, we genetically dissected the developing liver niche by systematically determining the cellular source of a key HSC niche factor, stem cell factor (SCF). Most HSCs were closely associated with sinusoidal vasculature. Using Scfgfp knockin mice, we found that Scf was primarily expressed by endothelial and perisinusoidal hepatic stellate cells. Conditional deletion of Scf from hepatocytes, hematopoietic cells, Ng2+ cells, or endothelial cells did not affect HSC number or function. Deletion of Scf from hepatic stellate cells depleted HSCs. Nearly all HSCs were lost when Scf was deleted from both endothelial and hepatic stellate cells. The expression of several niche factors was down-regulated in stellate cells around birth, when HSCs egress the developing liver. Thus, hepatic stellate and endothelial cells create perisinusoidal vascular HSC niche in the developing liver by producing SCF.",

        "Title": "The association of liver function biomarkers with internal exposure of short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins in residents from Jinan, China.",
        "Abstract": "Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) are pervasive environmental pollutants which have been reported to be hepatotoxic by laboratory cell and animal studies. However, the related epidemiological reports on their hepatotoxic effects to humans are sparse. In this study, we evaluated the associations between six liver enzymes and serum short-chain CP (SCCP) or medium-chain CP (MCCP) concentrations of 197 residents in Jinan, China. Serum S/MCCPs were detected by quadrupole time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source (APCI-QTOF-HRMS), and quantified by pattern deconvolution method. The associations between total serum S/MCCP concentrations (Î£S/MCCPs) and continuous liver enzyme levels were assessed by linear regression. Odds ratios (ORs) for the effects of serum Î£S/MCCPs concentrations on liver function biomarkers dichotomized by clinical reference intervals were predicted by logistic regression, either treating Î£S/MCCPs as continuous or categorical dependents. After multivariable adjustment, linear regression results illustrated that 1-ln unit increase in serum Î£SCCPs was negatively associated with male PA levels [-6.08, 95% confidence interval (CI):Â -11.90,Â -3.25, pÂ <Â 0.05], positively associated with male TB levels (1.80, 95% CI: 0.28, 3.31, pÂ <Â 0.05), and positively associated with female AST levels (1.39, 95% CI: 0.07, 2.70, pÂ <Â 0.05). One-ln unit increase in serum Î£MCCPs was negatively associated male PA levels (-7.56, 95% CI:Â -17.15,Â -4.03, pÂ <Â 0.05). Logistic regression results suggested that male serum Î£SCCPs were associated with increased prevalence of abnormal PA (ORÂ =Â 1.47 per 1 ln-unit increase, CIÂ =Â 1.18, 1.82) and TB (ORÂ =Â 1.75, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.12, 2.76) levels, and male serum Î£MCCPs were significantly associated with increased prevalence of abnormal PA (ORÂ =Â 1.43, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.03, 1.97) levels. In addition, male participants with concentrations above the median Î£S/MCCPs were associated with increased risk for abnormal PA levels [SCCPs, 2.11-fold (95% CIÂ =Â 1.15, 3.87); MCCPs, 1.94-fold (95% CIÂ =Â 1.24, 3.03)]. Male participants with concentrations above the median Î£SCCPs were also associated with increased risk for abnormal TB levels (ORÂ =Â 1.75, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.12, 2.76). Conclusively, our results revealed that CP internal exposure was associated with disturbed liver biomarker levels, suggesting the hepatotoxicity of both SCCPs and MCCPs to humans.",

        "Abstract": "The application of natural preservatives has become an attractive method for controlling postharvest decay of fruits and vegetables. Allicin, the main active ingredient of allium plants, has broad-spectrum antifungal activity. However, the unstable properties of allicin limit its wide application. In this study, 1-[(R)-ethylsulfinyl]sulfanylethane, a structurally stable derivative of allicin, was used to explore its antifungal activity and potential mechanism on the expansion of Penicillium expansum. We demonstrated the antifungal activity of 1-[(R)-ethylsulfinyl]sulfanylethane through in vitro antifungal experiments. At the concentration is 2âmg/L, 1-[((R)-ethylsulfinyl]sulfanyl]ethane can completely inhibit spore germination and mycelial growth, whereas the concentration of allicin needs to reach 16âmg/L. Fungal Biochemical assay indicated that decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, overgeneration of reactive oxygen species, decrease of adenosine triphosphateÂ and glutathione content, increase of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and malondialdehydeÂ content. The results revealed that 1-[(R)-ethylsulfinyl]sulfanylethane induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in P. expansum. Due to its excellent antifungal activity, 1-[((R)-ethylsulfinyl]sulfanyl]ethane might be developed as a substitute for fungicides against P. expansum in postharvest fruit storage.",

        "Abstract": "An accurate determination of the foam simulation parameters is crucial in modeling foam flow in porous media. In this paper, we present an integrated workflow to obtain the parameters in the local equilibrium foam model by history matching a series of laboratory experiments performed at reservoir conditions (131 F and 1500 psi) on Estaillades limestone using a commercial reservoir simulator. The gas-water and water-oil relative permeability curves were first validated after history matching with the unsteady-state flooding experiments. The modeling parameters for foam generation and foam dry-out effect were obtained by history matching with the gas/surfactant coinjection experiments at varying foam quality and injection rates. Moreover, the modeling parameters for the destabilizing effect of oil on foam and foam shear thinning effect were derived after history matching with the foam-enhanced oil recovery process and oil fractional flow experiments in the laboratory. In practice, the calculated results reproduce the experimental outputs reasonably well. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of foam modeling parameters is investigated to determine the most dominating parameters for accurate simulation of foam-enhanced oil recovery process in porous media. In this work, an efficient parameter estimation approach is developed from reliable foam flooding experimental data, which may be further applied to field-scale simulation. Moreover, the simulation approach can also be utilized to facilitate our interpretation of complex lab foam flooding results.",

        "Abstract": "Blackbody cavity reflectivity is normally measured using an integrating sphere to collect hemispherical reflected radiation from a blackbody opening when illuminated by a directional light source. The challenge of taking this method without an integrating sphere arises for blackbody cavity emissivity measurement in satellites due to space constraints. The ratio of hemispherical-given solid angle reflections is proposed to calculate the total reflected power from a blackbody cavity by multiplying a measurable reflected power in a given solid angle. The ratio is obtained by simulating the distribution relationship between the total hemispherical reflected light power and the reflected light power in the given solid angle under different coating emissivity. The emissivity measurement results are consistent with radiometric method measurements and simulation results, with an uncertainty of 0.0005.",

        "Abstract": "This article is concerned with the distributed secondary frequency and voltage control for islanded microgrids. First, the distributed secondary control problem is formulated by taking both communication delays and switching topologies into account. Second, by using an Artstein model reduction method, a novel delay-compensated distributed control scheme is proposed to restore frequencies of each distributed generator (DG) to a reference level in finite time, while achieving active power sharing in prescribed finite-time regardless of initial deviations generated from primary control. Third, a distributed finite-time controller is developed to regulate voltages of all DGs to a reference level. Fourth, the proposed idea is also applied to deal with the finite-time consensus for first-order multiagent systems. Finally, case studies are carried out, demonstrating the effectiveness, the robustness against load changes, and the plug-and-play capability of the proposed controllers.",

        "Abstract": "Finding an appropriate adsorbent with high adsorption capacity, quick adsorption kinetics and easy regeneration was crucial to the removal of gallic acid (GA) from water and wastewater. Our aims were to investigate whether a magnetic ion exchange (MIEX) resin had the three merits mentioned above, and investigate the feasibility of GA adsorption on MIEX resin, and the adsorption kinetics, equilibrium, thermodynamics, regeneration and mechanism using batch tests. The uptake of GA increased with increasing GA concentration. The GA concentration influenced the time needed to reach equilibrium, but the adsorption could be completed within 120 min. Elevating temperature facilitated the GA removal. The removal percent remained above 95.0% at pH 5.0-11.0. Carbonate and bicarbonate promoted the GA removal; conversely chloride, sulfate and nitrate restrained the GA removal significantly. The adsorption kinetics could be fitted well with the pseudo second-order model, and the film diffusion governed the whole adsorption rate. The equilibrium data followed the Redlich-Peterson isotherm model. The adsorption was a spontaneous, endothermic and entropy driven process. The ion exchange dominated the removal mechanism. The spent MIEX resin was well regenerated by sodium chloride. Therefore, MIEX resin is a potential adsorbent for removing GA quickly and efficiently from water and wastewater.",

        "Abstract": "In order to analyze and control air pollutant emissions effectively, on the basis of comprehensive consideration of three different pollution sources of industrial sulfur dioxide, industrial nitrogen oxides, and industrial smoke and dust, the Tapio decoupling model and LMDI decomposition model with six decomposition variables are constructed to compare the effects of socioeconomic factors on industrial air pollutant emissions in 11 cities in Zhejiang Province during 2006-2017. Then, a decoupling effort model is developed to analyze the effectiveness of the decoupling efforts taken at city level. This study found that (1) during the period of 2006-2017, the air pollutant emission reduction work in Zhejiang Province achieved remarkable results. More specifically, economic scale effect and population effect are the main factors for the increase of air pollutant emissions. And, the energy emission intensity effect and technological progress are the main driving forces for the reduction of three atmospheric pollutants, followed by the reduction effect of industrial structure and energy structure. (2) The environmental pollution problems of different air pollution sources in different cities are heterogeneous. (3) Eleven cities in Zhejiang Province have made significant decoupling efforts on the emission of three kinds of air pollutants, but there are some differences in the trend of the decoupling effort index of different pollution sources in different cities. In the future, illustrating by the example of Zhejiang, we should implement a \"common but different\" emission reduction strategy and emphasize pollutant emissions control during energy use in the efforts of further promoting the reduction of air pollutants.",

        "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) originating from mesenchyme is one of the most common invasive tumors of bone, and has an extremely high mortality rate. Previous studies have reported that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of a multitude of human cancers. The lncRNA DSCAM-AS1 has been reported to be an oncogenic gene in many cancers. However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms of DSCAM-AS1 in OS have not been deeply investigated. In this study, our findings prove that DSCAM-AS1 is highly expressed in OS cells. Knockdown of DSCAM-AS1 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, and induced cell apoptosis in OS. Additionally, knockdown of DSCAM-AS1 inactivated the Wnt-Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, research into its molecular mechanisms confirmed that DSCAM-AS1 functions as a sponge for miR-101-3p, and that ",

        "Abstract": "Human exposure to chlorinated paraffins (CPs) has been expected and assessed by external pathways considering their pervasive environmental occurrence. However, the deficiency of external exposure assessment in characterizing human burden is unavoidable. In addition, the associations between health outcomes and CP contents in human biospecimen are rarely assessed. In this study, we reported the occurrence and homologue profiles of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) in serum samples from 145 residents aged from 50 to 84 in Jinan, Shandong Province of China using quadrupole time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source operated in negative ion mode (APCI-qTOF-HRMS). The associations between serum CP concentrations and hematologic parameters were further analyzed by linear regression. We identified high level of âSCCPs (medianÂ =Â 107Â ng/g wet weight, ww; 13,800Â ng/g lipid, lw), âMCCPs (medianÂ =Â 134Â ng/g ww; 15,200Â ng/g lw) and elevated âMCCPs/âSCCPs (medianÂ =Â 1.12) in serum of the studied population.

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal tumors and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Since traditional biopsies are invasive and do not reflect tumor heterogeneity or monitor the dynamic progression of tumors, there is an urgent need for new noninvasive methods that can supplement and improve the current management strategies of CRC. Blood-based liquid biopsies are a promising noninvasive biomarker that can detect disease early, assist in staging, monitor treatment responses, and predict relapse and metastasis. Over time, an increasing number of experiments have indicated the clinical utility of liquid biopsies in CRC. In this review, we mainly focus on the development of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA as key components of liquid biopsies in CRC and introduce the potential of exosomal microRNAs as emerging liquid biopsy markers in clinical application for CRC.",

Data for 370 patients with HAPIs and 1971 patients without HAPIs were extracted from the adverse events and the electronic medical systems. They were randomly divided into two sets: training (n = 1951) and validation (n = 390). Significant risk factors were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses in the training set, followed by a nomogram constructed. Age, independent movement, sensory perception and response, moisture, perfusion, use of medical devices, compulsive position, hypoalbuminaemia, an existing pressure injury or scarring from a previous pressure injury, and surgery sufferings were considered significant risk factors and were included to construct a nomogram. In both of the training and validation sets, the areas of 0.90 under the receiver operating characteristic curves showed excellent discrimination of the nomogram; calibration plots demonstrated a good consistency between the observed probability and the nomogram's prediction; decision curve analyses exhibited preferable net benefit along with the threshold probability in the nomogram. The excellent performance of the nomogram makes it a convenient and reliable tool for the risk prediction of HAPIs.",

In this paper, a face image recognition algorithm based on 2-D Gabor wavelet transform and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is proposed. LBP is a local describe operator, which is invariant against illumination variation. 2-D Gabor wavelet transform have the invariant property against pose and expression variation. Experimental results show that the large scale 2-D Gabor wavelet representation could get good classification accuracy. Using LBP to describe 2-D Gabor wavelet representation of face image, together with image block, histogram statistics, PCA dimensionality reduction, nearestneighbors classification, we finally find this algorithm can get a better classification performance in different scales and directions.",

        "Abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are serine/threonine kinases whose catalytic activities are regulated by interactions with cyclins and CDK inhibitors (CKIs). CDKs are key regulatory enzymes involved in cell proliferation through regulating cell-cycle checkpoints and transcriptional events in response to extracellular and intracellular signals. Not surprisingly, the dysregulation of CDKs is a hallmark of cancers, and inhibition of specific members is considered an attractive target in cancer therapy. In breast cancer (BC), dual CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, combined with other agents, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently for the treatment of hormone receptor positive (HR+) advanced or metastatic breast cancer (A/MBC), as well as other sub-types of breast cancer. Furthermore, ongoing studies identified more selective CDK inhibitors as promising clinical targets. In this review, we focus on the roles of CDKs in driving cell-cycle progression, cell-cycle checkpoints, and transcriptional regulation, a highlight of dysregulated CDK activation in BC. We also discuss the most relevant CDK inhibitors currently in clinical BC trials, with special emphasis on CDK4/6 inhibitors used for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor 2-negative (HER2-) M/ABC patients, as well as more emerging precise therapeutic strategies, such as combination therapies and microRNA (miRNA) therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Root water uptake is strongly influenced by the morphology and anatomical structure of roots, which are regulated by nitrogen forms and environmental stimuli. To further illustrate the roles of different nitrogen forms on root water uptake under osmotic stress, a split-root system was supplied with different nitrogen forms and osmotic stress simulated by adding 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG, 6000). The local effects of nitrogen form and osmotic stress on root morphology, anatomical structure, root lignin content, and water uptake rate were investigated. Under osmotic stress conditions, ammonium markedly promoted the formation and elongation of the lateral root, whereas a significant decrease in numbers of lateral roots was observed under local nitrate supply. Under nitrate supply in split-root systems, osmotic stress significantly promoted root cell death and more aerenchyma formation, as well as accelerated the lignification of the root. However, osmotic stress had no negative effect on the root anatomical structure under ammonium supply. The root water uptake rate was significantly higher in split-root supplied with ammonium than nitrate under osmotic stress conditions. In conclusion, the high water uptake ability in local ammonium supply was associated with the more lateral roots development and the lower cell death, aerenchyma formation and lignification under osmotic stress.",

        "Abstract": "Naked-eye detection pH sensor is becoming a powerful tool in food safety monitoring. In this work, a pH sensor was developed by incorporating cellulose modified with acidochromic dye into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The results indicated that the dye (up to 170.4â¯Î¼mol/g) was successfully anchored to cellulose. It was demonstrated that the addition of acidochromic regenerated cellulose (ARC) resulted in enhancement of tensile strength, elongation at break and maximum decomposition temperature by 44 %, 43.6 % and 11â¯Â°C, respectively. The pH sensor demonstrated that a visible color change from yellow to brick-red and to purple when placed in solutions of pHâ¯=â¯7, 10 and 12. The pH sensor showed excellent resistance to leaching under strong acidic and alkaline conditions. When applied to spoiled shrimp, an evident color change from yellow to brown was observed, suggesting it could serve as an easy-to-use, non-destructive visual indicator system for real-time food monitoring.",

        "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is the most prevailing malignant tumor of digestive tract and accounts for a considerable part of cancer-relevant deaths worldwide. An increasing number of literatures highlight the important role of lncRNAs in the occurrence and development of GC. Considering that the function of RHPN1-AS1 in GC remains to be fully inquired, we purposed to investigate the potential and mechanism of RHPN1-AS1 in GC. The expression of RHPN1-AS1 was significantly upregulated in GC samples and cells. High RHPN1-AS1 level was strongly correlated with advanced stages of GC and predicted poor outcomes of GC. Furthermore, depletion of RHPN1-AS1 inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle whereas promoted cell apoptosis. Subcellular fractionation analysis expounded the main expression of RHPN1-AS1 in GC cell cytoplasm. Herein, we conjectured that RHPN1-AS1 might exert its performance in GC through the ceRNA network. Our findings demonstrated that RHPN1-AS1 enhanced ETS1 expression via sponging miR-1299. More importantly, the transcriptional activation of RHPN1-AS1 was mediated by ETS1. Results of recue assays validated that RHPN1-AS1/miR-1299/ETS1 positive feedback loop aggravated the malignant behaviors of GC, revealing RHPN1-AS1 as a latent effective target for the treatment of GC patients.",

        "Abstract": "Cellulosic colloidal suspensions present unique opportunities for rheological modification of complex fluids. In this work, the rheological behavior of regenerated cellulose (RC) suspensions, including their oscillating shear and time-dependent behavior, as well as yield stress, were studied. The rheological effects of sodium alginate's addition to aqueous RC solutions subject to shear flow were investigated. The results reveal that the RC suspension exhibited \"gel-like\" behavior and had a shear-thinning property. At increasing RC concentrations, the suspensions' yield stress and the extent of viscosity recovery after plastic deformation had both increased. The viscoelastic suspensions underwent a transition from \"solid-like\" to \"liquid-like\" behavior upon sodium alginate's inclusion. Sodium alginate was found to enhance RC suspensions' viscosity recoverability. Furthermore, with increasing concentrations of sodium alginate, the yield stress of RC suspension began to decrease and then vanished, occurring below the 1:1 RC: sodium alginate weight ratio with total solid content fixed at 1Â wt%, due to RC's inability to form an extended network RC. This study yields insights into the rheology of RC suspensions and the influence of sodium alginate and supports both their usage as rheological modifies in applications such as coatings, drug delivery systems, and additive manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing.",

        "Abstract": "Diffuse optical tomography (DOT), a subset of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), is a noninvasive functional imaging modality for studying the human brain in normal and diseased conditions. It measures changes in concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) in the blood vasculature of the brain. In contrast to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the gold standard in human brain imaging, DOT offers the advantage of higher temporal resolution, portability, lower cost, multiple contrasts and usability for persons who cannot otherwise utilize MRI-based imaging modalities, including bedridden patients and infants, etc. The goal of the present study was to evaluate performance of a DOT method in studying dynamic patterns of brain activations involving motor control. CW-fNIRS data were acquired in four sessions from a healthy male participant when he performed a motor task in a block-design experiment. Results from experimental data showed pronounced activity in the primary motor cortex (M1), contralateral to the clenching hand. It was further observed that the M1 activity was consistent over four sessions. Furthermore, temporal dynamics of motor activity at each session further revealed well-sequenced activation patterns among M1, premotor cortex (PMC), and supplementary motor area (SMA). Timed ipsilateral motor activity suppression was also observed several seconds after the onset of contralateral M1 activity. More importantly, these temporal dynamics were similarly observed in all four sessions. These preliminary results suggest that the DOT method has the sensitivity, reliability, and spatio-temporal resolutions to study activities originated from the motor cortices. A full-scope evaluation and validation in more participants on the motor system can establish it as a promising neuroimaging tool to study, such as, infants at the risk of cerebral palsy or elders with Parkinson's due to its portability and usability in clinical environments.",

Two major methods, i.e., seed-based correlation analysis (SBCA) and independent component analysis (ICA), are widely used to extract ICNs. Among them, ICA usually involves a dual regression analysis in order to obtain final spatial definitions of ICNs. Recently, we proposed a framework that includes cortical source imaging, source-level ICA, and statistical correlation analysis, to extract cortical ICNs from resting-state EEG data. In the present study, we proposed an alternative framework that uses sensor-level ICA and regression analysis instead of source-level ICA and correlation analysis, considering the well-studied characteristics of sensor-level ICs in differentiating neural activities from artifacts and the benefit of regression in accommodating multivariate analysis over correlation. In the present study, we mainly investigated the performance of the proposed procedure in extracting cortical ICNs. Meanwhile, we also investigated different variants of the regressors sampled at different frequencies to formulate the regression model. The results demonstrated that cortical ICNs corresponding to major ICNs identified in literature could be obtained by the proposed framework. In general, spatial patterns of cortical ICNs obtained via both correlation and regression analyses show statistically significant similarity. However, the cortical ICNs reconstructed using the regression analysis exhibit more focal and more superficial spatial patterns, in general, that the cortical ICNs from the correlation analysis. The different variants of regressors at the same sampling frequency do not produce obvious impacts on spatial patterns of cortical ICNs, while the different sampling frequencies show large effects on extracted spatial patterns of cortical ICNs. In summary, it is suggested that the proposed framework with the regression analysis is promising in reconstructing cortical ICNs from EEG, while the sampling frequency used in the formulation process of regressors may have large impacts on reconstructed cortical ICN patterns.",

        "Abstract": "This article is concerned with designing resilient state feedback controllers for a class of networked control systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The sensor samples system states periodically. The DoS attacks usually prevent those sampled signals from being transmitted through a communication network. A logic processor embedded in the controller is introduced to not only receive sampled signals but also capture information on the duration time of each DoS attack. Note that the duration time of DoS attacks is usually both lower and upper bounded. Then the closed-loop system is modeled as an aperiodic sampled-data system closely related to both lower and upper bounds of duration time of DoS attacks. By introducing a novel looped functional, which caters for the N -order canonical Bessel-Legendre inequalities, some N -dependent stability criteria are presented for the resultant closed-loop system. It is worth pointing out that a number of identity formulas are uncovered, which enable us to apply the notable free-weighting matrix approach to derive less conservative stability criteria. A linear-matrix-inequality-based criterion is provided to design stabilizing state-feedback controllers against DoS attacks. A satellite control system is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "Abstract": "Accurately estimating grassland carbon stocks is important in assessing grassland productivity and the global carbon balance. This study used the regression kriging (RK) method to estimate grassland carbon stocks in Northeast China based on Landsat8 operational land imager (OLI) images and five remote sensing variables. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), the chlorophyll index (CI), Band6 and Band7 were used to build the RK models separately and to explore their capabilities for modeling spatial distributions of grassland carbon stocks. To explore the different model performances for typical grassland and meadow grassland, the models were validated separately using the typical steppe, meadow steppe or all-steppe ground measurements based on leave-one-out crossvalidation (LOOCV). When the results were validated against typical steppe samples, the Band6 model showed the best performance (coefficient of determination (R",
