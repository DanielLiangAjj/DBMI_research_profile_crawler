        "Abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and specifically the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is the central regulator of anabolism in skeletal muscle. Among the many functions of this kinase complex is the inhibition of the catabolic process of autophagy; however, less work has been done in investigating the role of autophagy in regulating mTORC1 signaling. Using an in vitro model to better understand the pathways involved, we activated mTORC1 by several different means (growth factors, leucine supplementation, or muscle contraction), alone or with the autophagy inhibitor NSC185058. We found that inhibiting autophagy with NSC185058 suppresses mTORC1 activity, preventing any increase in cellular protein anabolism. These decrements were the direct result of action on the mTORC1 kinase, which we demonstrate, for the first time, cannot function when autophagy is inhibited by NSC185058. Our results indicate that, far from being a matter of unidirectional action, the relationship between mTORC1 and the autophagic cascade is more nuanced, with autophagy serving as an mTORC1 input, and mTORC1 inhibition of autophagy as a form of homeostatic feedback to regulate anabolic signaling. Future studies of cellular metabolism will have to consider this fundamental intertwining of protein anabolism and catabolism, and how it ultimately serves to regulate muscle proteostasis.",

        "Title": "Bone loss in shoulder instability: putting it all together.",
        "Abstract": "Glenohumeral bone loss is frequently observed in cases of recurrent anterior and posterior shoulder instability and represents a risk factor for failure of nonoperative treatment. Patients with suspected glenoid or humeral bone loss in the setting of recurrent instability should be evaluated with a thorough history and physical examination, as well as advanced imaging including computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In cases of both anterior and posterior instability, the magnitude and location of bone loss should be determined, as well as the relationship between the glenoid track (GT) and any humeral defects. While the degree and pattern of osseous deficiency help guide treatment, patient-specific risk factors for recurrent instability must also be considered when determining patient management. Treatment options for subcritical anterior bone loss include labral repair and capsular plication, while more severe deficiency should prompt consideration of bony augmentation including coracoid transfer or free bone block procedures. Concomitant humeral lesions are treated according to the degree of engagement with the glenoid rim and may be addressed with soft tissue remplissage or bony augmentation procedures. While critical and subcritical thresholds of glenoid bone loss guide the management of anterior instability, such thresholds are less defined in the setting of posterior instability. Furthermore, current treatment algorithms are limited by a lack of long-term comparative studies. Future high-quality studies as well as possible modifications in indications and surgical technique are required to elucidate the optimal treatment of anterior, posterior, and bipolar glenohumeral bone loss in the setting of recurrent shoulder instability.",

        "Abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)¬†are a valuable class of medications for orthopedic surgeons and often play a pivotal role in pain control. However, there are many common stipulations resulting in avoidance of its use in the treatment of musculoskeletal disease. This review summarizes the mechanism of action of NSAIDs as well as provides an overview of commonly used NSAIDs and the differences between them. It provides a concise summary on the osseous effects of NSAIDs with regard to bone healing and heterotopic ossification. Most of all, it serves as a guide or reference for orthopedic providers when counseling patients on the risks and benefits of NSAID use, as it addresses the common stipulations encountered: \"It irritates my stomach,\" \"I have a history of bariatric surgery,\" \"I'm already on a blood thinner,\" \"I've had a heart attack,\" and \"I've got kidney problems\" and synthesizes both current research and society recommendations regarding safe use and avoidance of NSAIDs.",

Non-offending family members are often considered a valuable protective resource for offender desistance and in safeguarding children from abuse. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the lived experiences of female family members of CSAM offenders in Ireland and the United Kingdom to both identify and target areas for intervention thus ameliorating their ability to protect. A qualitative research design was adopted, and data analyzed via reflexive thematic analysis. Fifteen individuals self-selected for participation and interviews resulted in the identification of three key themes: ",

One-hundred percent (252/252) of eligible patients enrolled in the clinic were screened for suicide risk (44% female; M[SD] age‚Äâ=‚Äâ45.0[11.0] years, range‚Äâ=‚Äâ21-68¬†years). Nineteen patients (8%) screened positive for suicide risk. After screening, no patients required emergency suicide interventions (100% non-acute positive). Notably, 74% (14/19) of those who screened positive did so by endorsing at least one past suicide attempt with no recent ideation. Suicide risk screening in virtual addiction clinics yields important clinical information for high-risk SUD populations without overburdening workflow with emergency services. Given the high proportion of non-acute positive screens based on suicide attempt histories with no recent ideation, clinicians may utilize information on suicide attempt history to facilitate further mental healthcare.",

        "Abstract": "Place-based exposures, termed \"geomarkers\", are powerful determinants of health but are often understudied because of a lack of open data and integration tools. Existing DeGAUSS (Decentralized Geomarker Assessment for Multisite Studies) software has been successfully implemented in multi-site studies, ensuring reproducibility and protection of health information. However, DeGAUSS relies on transporting geomarker data, which is not feasible for high-resolution spatiotemporal data too large to store locally or download over the internet. We expanded the DeGAUSS framework for high-resolution spatiotemporal geomarkers. Our approach stores data subsets based on coarsened location and year in an online repository, and appropriate subsets are downloaded to complete exposure assessment locally using exact date and location. We created and validated two free and open-source DeGAUSS containers for estimation of high-resolution, daily ambient air pollutant exposures, transforming published exposure assessment models into computable exposures for geomarker assessment at scale.",

We present a case of tumoral calcinosis in a 13-year-old male with a history of a 12q13.11 genetic deletion. Surgical resection of the tumor necessitated resection of the ACL in its entirety with curettage and adjuvant therapy to the lateral femoral notch, which resulted in ligamentous instability and bony structural incompetency at the femoral insertion. Given the patient's radiographically-apparent skeletal immaturity, and lack of reliable bony architecture to accommodate a femoral ACL tunnel, ACL reconstruction was performed using a physeal-sparing technique. This is a case of tumoral calcinosis treated with, to our knowledge, the first ACL reconstruction using this modified open technique.",

        "Abstract": "Early detection of risk is a key suicide prevention strategy. Given that most individuals who die by suicide visit a health care provider in the year leading up to their death, medical settings are ideal venues for identifying those at elevated risk and bridging them to life-saving care. Clinicians are presented with an opportunity to engage in proactive suicide prevention efforts through practical and adaptable suicide risk screening, assessment, and management processes. Psychiatrists and mental health clinicians are well positioned to assist nonpsychiatric clinicians on the frontlines of this public health problem. This article discusses the importance of identifying people at elevated suicide risk through screening, differentiates screening from assessment procedures, and presents practical strategies for implementing evidence-based screening and assessment tools into practice as part of a three-tiered clinical pathway. Specifically, this article discusses key components that guide embedding suicide prevention strategies into the workflows of busy medical settings.",

        "Abstract": "Observational data can be used to conduct drug surveillance and effectiveness studies, investigate treatment pathways, and predict patient outcomes. Such studies require developing executable algorithms to find patients of interest or phenotype algorithms. Creating reliable and comprehensive phenotype algorithms in data networks is especially hard as differences in patient representation and data heterogeneity must be considered. In this paper, we discuss a process for creating a comprehensive concept set and a recommender system we built to facilitate it. PHenotype Observed Entity Baseline Endorsements (PHOEBE) uses the data on code utilization across 22 electronic health record and claims datasets mapped to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Common Data Model from the 6 countries to recommend semantically and lexically similar codes. Coupled with Cohort Diagnostics, it is now used in major network OHDSI studies. When used to create patient cohorts, PHOEBE identifies more patients and captures them earlier in the course of the disease.",

        "Abstract": "Treatment effects are often anticipated to vary across groups of patients with different baseline risk. The Predictive Approaches to Treatment Effect Heterogeneity (PATH) statement focused on baseline risk as a robust predictor of treatment effect and provided guidance on risk-based assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity in a randomized controlled trial. The aim of this study is to extend this approach to the observational setting using a standardized scalable framework. The proposed framework consists of five steps: (1) definition of the research aim, i.e., the population, the treatment, the comparator and the outcome(s) of interest; (2) identification of relevant databases; (3) development of a prediction model for the outcome(s) of interest; (4) estimation of relative and absolute treatment effect within strata of predicted risk, after adjusting for observed confounding; (5) presentation of the results. We demonstrate our framework by evaluating heterogeneity of the effect of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on three efficacy and nine safety outcomes across three observational databases. We provide a publicly available R software package for applying this framework to any database mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. In our demonstration, patients at low risk of acute myocardial infarction receive negligible absolute benefits for all three efficacy outcomes, though they are more pronounced in the highest risk group, especially for acute myocardial infarction. Our framework allows for the evaluation of differential treatment effects across risk strata, which offers the opportunity to consider the benefit-harm trade-off between alternative treatments.",

        "Abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a highly dynamic organ that is essential for locomotion as well as endocrine regulation in all populations of horses. However, despite the importance of adequate muscle development and maintenance, the mechanisms underlying protein anabolism in horses on different diets, exercise programs, and at different life stages remain obscure. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key component of the protein synthesis pathway and is regulated by biological factors such as insulin and amino acid availability. Providing a diet ample in vital amino acids, such as leucine and glutamine, is essential in activating sensory pathways that recruit mTOR to the lysosome and assist in the translation of important downstream targets. When the diet is well balanced, mitochondrial biogenesis and protein synthesis are activated in response to increased exercise bouts in the performing athlete. It is important to note that the mTOR kinase pathways are multifaceted and very complex, with several binding partners and targets that lead to specific functions in protein turnover of the cell, and ultimately, the capacity to maintain or grow muscle mass. Further, these pathways are likely altered across the lifespan, with an emphasis of growth in young horses while decreases in musculature with aged horses appears to be attributable to degradation or other regulators of protein synthesis rather than alterations in the mTOR pathway. Previous work has begun to pinpoint ways in which the mTOR pathway is influenced by diet, exercise, and age; however, future research is warranted to quantify the functional outcomes related to changes in mTOR. Promisingly, this could provide direction on appropriate management techniques to support skeletal muscle growth and maximize athletic potential in differing equine populations.",

        "Abstract": "Although small spills of non-ideal organic solvent mixtures are ubiquitous undesirable events in occupational settings, the potential risk of exposure associated with such scenarios remains insufficiently investigated. This study aimed to examine the impact of non-ideality on evaporation rates and contaminant air concentrations resulting from small spills of organic solvent mixtures. Evaporation rate constants alphas (Œ±) were experimentally measured for five pure solvents using a gravimetric approach during solvent evaporation tests designed to simulate small spills of solvents. Two equations were used for estimating contaminants' evaporation rates from aqueous mixtures assuming either ideal or non-ideal behavior based on the pure-chemical alpha values. A spill model also known as the well-mixed room model with exponentially decreasing emission rate was used to predict air concentrations during various spill scenarios based on the two sets of estimated evaporation rates. Model predictive performance was evaluated by comparing the estimates against real-time concentrations measured for the same scenarios. Evaluations for 12 binary non-ideal aqueous mixtures found that the estimated evaporation rates accounting for the correction by the activity coefficients of the solvents (median = 0.0318‚Äâmin",

        "Abstract": "Phenotype algorithms are central to performing analyses using observational data. These algorithms translate the clinical idea of a health condition into an executable set of rules allowing for queries of data elements from a database. PheValuator, a software package in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tool stack, provides a method to assess the performance characteristics of these algorithms, namely, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value. It uses machine learning to develop predictive models for determining a probabilistic gold standard of subjects for assessment of cases and non-cases of health conditions. PheValuator was developed to complement or even replace the traditional approach of algorithm validation, i.e., by expert assessment of subject records through chart review. Results in our first PheValuator paper suggest a systematic underestimation of the PPV compared to previous results using chart review. In this paper we evaluate modifications made to the method designed to improve its performance.",

The etiology of mental health disorders includes genetic, social, and environmental factors. Ultrafine particles (UFPs; particles less than 0.1 Œºm in diameter) have been shown to exert neurotoxic effects on the brain; however, epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between UFPs and childhood mental health outcomes is unclear. The objective of this study was to determine if exposure to UFPs was associated with symptoms of mental health in adolescents. Adolescents completed personal UFP monitoring for one week as well as a series of validated Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) assessments to measure five domains of mental and physical stress symptoms.

        "Abstract": "There are a myriad of interventions promoting activities designed to help enhance sustained attention in children and adolescents. In this systematic review, we critically evaluate the evidence behind three popular sustained attention training approaches - cognitive attention training, meditation, and physical activity. Seven databases were searched in addition to secondary searches. Cognitive attention training, meditation training or physical activity intervention studies aimed at improving sustained attention (randomised-controlled or non-randomised-controlled designs) in samples of children and adolescents (3-18 years) were included. We screened 3437 unique articles. Thirty-seven studies satisfied inclusion criteria. In general, cognitive attention training (n¬†=¬†14) did not reliably improve sustained attention. Physical activity (n¬†=¬†15) and meditation interventions (n¬†=¬†8) demonstrated somewhat more potential in enhancing sustained attention, but these effects should be considered preliminary and need to be replicated with greater methodological rigour. Cognitive attention training demonstrated very limited transfer to other aspects of attention. Notably, mindfulness training had rather consistent positive effects on selective attention. Across all three intervention types, there was very weak evidence for transfer to other aspects of cognition, behaviour, and academic achievement. The paper concludes with methodological recommendations for future studies to strengthen the evidence base.",

        "Abstract": "Sustained attention and working memory are two closely intertwined executive functions that may underlie inattentive behavior. However, little research has teased apart their precise contributions in a single study. This study examines the extent to which ratings of children's inattentive behavior are associated with these executive functions. Specifically, we investigated the unique and overlapping statistical contributions of sustained attention capacity and working memory capacity to parent and teacher ratings of inattentive behavior (operationalized as scores on both the Inattentive and Hyperactive/Impulsive scales of the Conners' Rating Scale), while controlling for IQ. Children aged 8-11¬†years completed measures of sustained attention capacity, working memory capacity and IQ. Parents and teachers completed Conners-3 Parent and Teacher Short Forms, as a measure of inattentive behavior. We found that the unique statistical contribution of sustained attention capacity emerged as the most important factor in both parent and teacher ratings of inattentive behavior, with effects of moderate magnitude. In contrast, working memory capacity accounted for a small amount of variance. The overlap between sustained attention and working memory explained a small but substantive amount of variance in inattentive behavior. These findings support the idea that sustained attention and working memory are distinct executive functions that may contribute to goal-directed behavior both uniquely and through their interactions.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine and compare environmental microbiota from dust and children's respiratory health outcomes at ages seven and twelve. At age seven, in-home visits were conducted for children enrolled in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS). Floor dust was collected and analyzed for bacterial (16¬†S rRNA gene) and fungal (internal transcribed spacer region) microbiota. Respiratory outcomes, including physician-diagnosed asthma, wheeze, rhinitis, and aeroallergen sensitivity were assessed by physical examination and caregiver-report at ages seven and twelve. The associations between dust microbiota and respiratory outcomes were evaluated using Permanova, DESeq, and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression models. Four types of WQS regression models were run to identify mixtures of fungi or bacteria that were associated with the absence or presence of health outcomes. For alpha or beta diversity of fungi and bacteria, no significant associations were found with respiratory health outcomes. DESeq identified specific bacterial and fungal indicator taxa that were higher or lower with the presence of different health outcomes. Most individual indicator fungal species were lower with asthma and wheeze and higher with aeroallergen positivity and rhinitis, whereas bacterial data was less consistent. WQS regression models demonstrated that a combination of species might influence health outcomes. Several heavily weighted species had a strong influence on the models, and therefore, created a microbial community that was associated with the absence or presence of asthma, wheeze, rhinitis, and aeroallergen+. Weights for specific species within WQS regression models supported indicator taxa findings. Health outcomes might be more influenced by the composition of a complex mixture of bacterial and fungal species in the indoor environment than by the absence or presence of individual species. This study demonstrates that WQS is a useful tool in evaluating mixtures in relation to potential health effects.",

        "Title": "Towards a broader concept of wellbeing in evaluating paediatric quality of life.",
        "Abstract": "Paediatric health-care professionals have a primary duty to promote the best interests of their patients. This is reiterated in article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and is predicated on promoting children's health and wellbeing. However, there is ambiguity over what standard applies when evaluating whether a paediatric health-care decision supports good outcomes. Values like 'best interests', 'doing no harm' or 'quality of life' may be indeterminate or vague and clinicians may have difficulty in conceptualising what exactly constitutes 'a good life' for children. This uncertainty leads to the question: how do we best evaluate paediatric health decisions and outcomes? Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are questionnaires that aim to achieve this by attaining data on a patient's quality of life and wellbeing. While PROMs originated with adult cohorts, they have since been applied to paediatric populations. Children are vulnerable due to their interdependency; and this raises ethical tensions regarding the potential benefits of such data, respect for autonomy and assent/consent of the individual child in clinical settings. These inherent tensions should be balanced by realising a collective good for children. PROMs should be a robust data collection source that facilitates substantive justice, both procedurally and in distributing limited health resources via accurate quality-adjusted life-years generation. This article aims to (i) overview the traditional and emerging paediatric PROMs; (ii) outline the tensions of using PROMS for children in a clinical setting and (iii) analyse the ability of traditional and emerging PROMs to promote justice in paediatric resource allocation.",

        "Title": "Assessment of the Oxidative Potential and Oxidative Burden from Occupational Exposures to Particulate Matter.",
        "Abstract": "Oxidative potential (OP) is a toxicologically relevant metric that integrates features like mass concentration and chemical composition of particulate matter (PM). Although it has been extensively explored as a metric for the characterization of environmental particles, this is still an underexplored application in the occupational field. This study aimed to estimate the OP of particles in two occupational settings from a construction trades school. This characterization also includes the comparison between activities, sampling strategies, and size fractions. Particulate mass concentrations (PM4-Personal, PM4-Area, and PM2.5-Area) and number concentrations were measured during three weeks of welding and construction/bricklaying activities. The OP was assessed by the ascorbate assay (OPAA) using a synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF), while the oxidative burden (OBAA) was determined by multiplying the OPAA values with PM concentrations. Median (25th-75th percentiles) of PM mass and number concentrations were 900 (672-1730) ¬µg m-3 and 128 000 (78 000-169 000) particles cm-3 for welding, and 432 (345-530) ¬µg m-3 and 2800 (1700-4400) particles cm-3 for construction. Welding particles, especially from the first week of activities, were also associated with higher redox activity (OPAA: 3.3 (2.3-4.6) œÅmol min-1 ¬µg-1; OBAA: 1750 (893-4560) œÅmol min-1 m-3) compared to the construction site (OPAA: 1.4 (1.0-1.8) œÅmol min-1 ¬µg-1; OBAA: 486 (341-695) œÅmol min-1 m-3). The OPAA was independent of the sampling strategy or size fraction. However, driven by the higher PM concentrations, the OBAA from personal samples was higher compared to area samples in the welding shop, suggesting an influence of the sampling strategy on PM concentrations and OBAA. These results demonstrate that important levels of OPAA can be found in occupational settings, especially during welding activities. Furthermore, the OBAA found in both workplaces largely exceeded the levels found in environmental studies. Therefore, measures of OP and OB could be further explored as metrics for exposure assessment to occupational PM, as well as for associations with cardiorespiratory outcomes in future occupational epidemiological studies.",

        "Abstract": "Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) encourages clinicians to seek the most reputable evidence. The quality of evidence is organized in a hierarchy in which randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as least biased. However, RCTs are plagued by poor generalizability, impeding the translation of clinical research to practice. Though the presence of poor external validity is known, the factors that contribute to poor generalizability have not been summarized and placed in a framework. We propose a new population-oriented conceptual framework to facilitate consistent and comprehensive evaluation of generalizability, replicability, and assessment of RCT study quality.",

        "Abstract": "An increasing amount of evidence suggests ultrafine particles (UFPs) are linked to adverse health effects, especially in those with chronic conditions such as asthma, due to their small size and physicochemical characteristics. Toxicological and experimental studies have demonstrated these properties, and the mechanisms by which they deposit and translocate in the body result in increased toxicity in comparison to other air pollutants. However, current epidemiological literature is limited due to exposure misclassification and thus identifying health outcomes associated with UFPs. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between weekly personal UFP exposure with lung function and respiratory symptoms in 117 asthmatic and non-asthmatic adolescents between 13 and 17¬†years of age in the Cincinnati area. Between 2017 and 2019, participants collected weekly UFP concentrations by sampling for 3¬†h a day in their home, school, and during transit. In addition, pulmonary function was evaluated at the end of the sampling week, and respiratory symptoms were logged on a mobile phone application. Multivariable linear regression and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) models were used to estimate the association between personal UFP and respiratory outcomes. The average median weekly UFP exposure of all participants was 4340 particles/cm",

        "Abstract": "Parvimonas micra is an anaerobic, fastidious, gram positive organism commonly found in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. It has been increasingly reported as the cause of septic arthritis of native joints, often times with delayed diagnosis leading to increased morbidity. Risk factors include immunosuppression, inflammation of the joint, and recent dental procedures or infections. It has been a historically difficult organism to culture. However, the development of and increasing use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has led to increased identification of P.¬†micra. Common antibiotic susceptibilities, as well as data regarding susceptibilities in specific situations, have been reported, but susceptibility testing is required in all cases. Common treatments include clindamycin, penicillin, and metronidazole for six to ten weeks.",

Using census tract-level information, we created software for geocoding and geospatial data linkage that was distributed to a consortium of birth cohorts located throughout the USA. Individual sites performed geospatial linkages and returned tract-level information for 8810 children to a central site for analyses. Our generalizable approach demonstrates the feasibility of geospatial analyses across study sites to promote collaborative translational research.",

Manually devel- oped phenotyping algorithms, such as those curated within the eMERGE (electronic Medical Records and Genomics) Network, represent the gold standard but are time consuming to create. In this work, we propose a framework for learning from the structure of eMERGE phenotype concept sets to assist construction of novel phenotype definitions. We use eMERGE phenotypes as a source of reference concept sets and engineer rich features characterizing the con- cept pairs within each set. We treat these pairwise relationships as edges in a concept graph, train models to perform edge prediction, and identify candidate phenotype concept sets as highly connected subgraphs. Candidate concept sets may then be interrogated and composed to construct novel phenotype definitions.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-center observational studies require recognition and reconciliation of differences in patient representations arising from underlying populations, disparate coding practices and specifics of data capture. This leads to different granularity or detail of concepts representing the clinical facts. For researchers studying certain populations of interest, it is important to ensure that concepts at the right level are used for the definition of these populations. We studied the granularity of concepts within 22 data sources in the OHDSI network and calculated a composite granularity score for each dataset. Three alternative SNOMED-based approaches for such score showed consistency in classifying data sources into three levels of granularity (low, moderate and high), which correlated with the provenance of data and country of origin. However, they performed unsatisfactorily in ordering data sources within these groups and showed inconsistency for small data sources. Further studies on examining approaches to data source granularity are needed.",

        "Abstract": "The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in China demonstrated at an early stage the high rate of moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the patient population. An intervention that has proved beneficial is the use of prone positioning (PP) for mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS. In one institution, PP was practiced in the medical ICU for this population. However, with the dramatically increasing patient load, staff anticipated that greater capacity to provide this treatment to all qualifying patients would be required.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this analysis was to examine and compare quantitative metrics of observed dampness and mold, including visible mold and moisture damage, and fungal and bacterial microbiomes. In-home visits were conducted at age 7 for children enrolled in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study. Trained study staff evaluated the primary residence and measured total areas of visible moisture and mold damage in the home. Floor dust was collected and archived. Archived dust samples collected from each home (n = 178) were extracted and analyzed using bacterial (16S rRNA gene) and fungal (internal transcribed spacer region) sequencing. Fungi were also divided into moisture requirement categories of xerophiles, mesophiles, and hydrophiles. Data analyses used Spearman's correlation, Kruskal-Wallis, Permanova, DESeq, and negative binomial regression models. Comparing high moisture or mold damage to no damage, five fungal species and two bacterial species had higher concentrations (absolute abundance) and six fungal species and three bacterial species had lower concentrations. Hydrophilic and mesophilic fungi showed significant dose-related increases with increasing moisture damage and mold damage, respectively. When comparing alpha or beta diversity of fungi and bacteria across mold and moisture damage levels, no significant associations or differences were found. Mold and moisture damage did not affect diversity of fungal and bacterial microbiomes. Instead, both kinds of damage were associated with changes in species composition of both bacterial and fungal microbiomes, indicating that fungal and bacterial communities in the home might be influenced by one another as well as by mold or moisture in the home.",

        "Abstract": "Many observational studies explore the association between acetaminophen and cancer, but known limitations such as vulnerability to channeling, protopathic bias, and uncontrolled confounding hamper the interpretability of results. To help understand the potential magnitude of bias, we identify key design choices in these observational studies and specify 10 study design variants that represent different combinations of these design choices. We evaluate these variants by applying them to 37 negative controls - outcome presumed not to be caused by acetaminophen - as well as 4 cancer outcomes in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database. The estimated odds and hazards ratios for the negative controls show substantial bias in the evaluated design variants, with far fewer of the 95% confidence intervals containing 1 than the nominal 95% expected for negative controls. The effect-size estimates for the cancer outcomes are comparable to those observed for the negative controls. A comparison of exposed and unexposed reveals many differences at baseline for which most studies do not correct. We observe that the design choices made in many of the published observational studies can lead to substantial bias. Thus, caution in the interpretation of published studies of acetaminophen and cancer is recommended.",

        "Abstract": "The process and regulation of cellular metabolism are extremely complex and accomplished through multiple signalling pathways that operate in parallel, and often experience significant overlap in upstream and downstream a signal transduction. Despite this complexity, single pathway or even single protein activations are commonly used to extrapolate broad characterizations of cellular metabolism. Furthermore, multiple routes for peptide-chain translation initiation exist, some of which may be either exclusive or overlapping depending on the state and environment of the cell. While it may be highly impractical to account for every aspect of metabolic regulation and permutation of mRNA translation, it is important to acknowledge that investigations relating to these pathways are often incomplete and not necessarily indicative of the overall metabolic status. This becomes urgent when considering the role that cellular anabolism plays in both healthy cellular functions and the aetiology of several disease's altered metabolisms. This review describes recent advances in the understanding of cellular metabolic regulation, with specific focus given to the complexity of 'downstream' mRNA translation initiation through both mTOR-dependent and mTOR-independent signallings.",

        "Abstract": "Comorbid conditions appear to be common among individuals hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but estimates of prevalence vary and little is known about the prior medication use of patients. Here, we describe the characteristics of adults hospitalised with COVID-19 and compare them with influenza patients. We include 34,128 (US: 8362, South Korea: 7341, Spain: 18,425) COVID-19 patients, summarising between 4811 and 11,643 unique aggregate characteristics. COVID-19 patients have been majority male in the US and Spain, but predominantly female in South Korea. Age profiles vary across data sources. Compared to 84,585 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, COVID-19 patients have more typically been male, younger, and with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use. While protecting groups vulnerable to influenza is likely a useful starting point in the response to COVID-19, strategies will likely need to be broadened to reflect the particular characteristics of individuals being hospitalised with COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "Respiratory microbiome is an understudied area of research compared to other microbiomes of the human body. The respiratory tract is exposed to an array of environmental pollutants, including microbes. Yet, we know very little about the relationship between environmental and respiratory microbiome. The primary aim of our study was to compare the mycobiomes and bacteriomes between three sample types from the same participants, including home dust, saliva, and sputum. Samples were collected from 40 adolescents in a longitudinal cohort. We analyzed the samples using 16s bacterial rDNA and ITS fungal rDNA gene sequencing, as well as quantitative PCR with universal fungal and bacterial primers. Results showed that home dust had the greatest alpha diversity between the three sample types for both bacteria and fungi. Dust had the highest total fungal load and the lowest total bacterial load. Sputum had greater bacterial diversity than saliva, but saliva had greater fungal diversity than sputum. The distribution of major bacterial phyla differed between all sample types. However, the distribution of major fungal classes differed only between sputum and saliva. Future research should examine the biological significance of the taxa found in each sample type based on microbial ecology and associations with health effects.",

        "Abstract": "Evidence derived from existing health-care data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, can fill evidence gaps in medicine. However, many claim such data cannot be used to estimate causal treatment effects because of the potential for observational study bias; for example, due to residual confounding. Other concerns include P hacking and publication bias. In response, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics international collaborative launched the Large-scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation across a Network of Databases (LEGEND) research initiative. Its mission is to generate evidence on the effects of medical interventions using observational health-care databases while addressing the aforementioned concerns by following a recently proposed paradigm. We define 10 principles of LEGEND that enshrine this new paradigm, prescribing the generation and dissemination of evidence on many research questions at once; for example, comparing all treatments for a disease for many outcomes, thus preventing publication bias. These questions are answered using a prespecified and systematic approach, avoiding P hacking. Best-practice statistical methods address measured confounding, and control questions (research questions where the answer is known) quantify potential residual bias. Finally, the evidence is generated in a network of databases to assess consistency by sharing open-source analytics code to enhance transparency and reproducibility, but without sharing patient-level information. Here we detail the LEGEND principles and provide a generic overview of a LEGEND study. Our companion paper highlights an example study on the effects of hypertension treatments, and evaluates the internal and external validity of the evidence we generate.",

        "Title": "Deep phenotyping of 34,128 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and a comparison with 81,596 influenza patients in America, Europe and Asia: an international network study.",
        "Abstract": "Background In this study we phenotyped individuals hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in depth, summarising entire medical histories, including medications, as captured in routinely collected data drawn from databases across three continents. We then compared individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 to those previously hospitalised with influenza. Methods We report demographics, previously recorded conditions and medication use of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the US (Columbia University Irving Medical Center [CUIMC], Premier Healthcare Database [PHD], UCHealth System Health Data Compass Database [UC HDC], and the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA OMOP]), in South Korea (Health Insurance Review & Assessment [HIRA]), and Spain (The Information System for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP] and HM Hospitales [HM]). These patients were then compared with patients hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19. Results 34,128 (US: 8,362, South Korea: 7,341, Spain: 18,425) individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 were included. Between 4,811 (HM) and 11,643 (CUIMC) unique aggregate characteristics were extracted per patient, with all summarised in an accompanying interactive website (http://evidence.ohdsi.org/Covid19CharacterizationHospitalization/). Patients were majority male in the US (CUIMC: 52%, PHD: 52%, UC HDC: 54%, VA OMOP: 94%,) and Spain (SIDIAP: 54%, HM: 60%), but were predominantly female in South Korea (HIRA: 60%). Age profiles varied across data sources. Prevalence of asthma ranged from 4% to 15%, diabetes from 13% to 43%, and hypertensive disorder from 24% to 70% across data sources. Between 14% and 33% were taking drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system in the 30 days prior to hospitalisation. Compared to 81,596 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, patients admitted with COVID-19 were more typically male, younger, and healthier, with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use. Conclusions We provide a detailed characterisation of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Protecting groups known to be vulnerable to influenza is a useful starting point to minimize the number of hospital admissions needed for COVID-19. However, such strategies will also likely need to be broadened so as to reflect the particular characteristics of individuals hospitalised with COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as the most reputable source of evidence. In some studies, factors beyond the intervention itself may contribute to the measured effect, an occurrence known as heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). If the RCT population differs from the real-world population on factors that induce HTE, the trials effect will not replicate. The RCTs eligibility criteria should identify the sub-population in which its evidence will replicate. However, the extent to which the eligibility criteria identify the appropriate population is unknown, which raises concerns for generalizability. We compared reported data from RCTs with real-world data from the electronic health records of a large, academic medical center that was curated according to RCT eligibility criteria. Our results show fundamental differences between the RCT population and our observational cohorts, which suggests that eligibility criteria may be insufficient for identifying the applicable real-world population in which RCT evidence will replicate.",

While treatment guidelines and care variations for these comorbidities have been described for the general noncancer population, less is known about real-world treatment patterns in patients with cancer.

If it was possible to identify patients who are at a higher risk of opioid use disorder, then clinicians could spend more time educating these patients about the risks.

        "Title": "Cortical and affective regulation of autonomic coordination.",
        "Abstract": "Although anatomical research clearly demonstrates the ability of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system to independently influence cardiac function, little research has examined whether coordinated activation is typical or whether the extent of autonomic coordination is situationally dependent. This study examines the extent of coordination between sympathetic (cardiac pre-ejection period: PEP) and parasympathetic (respiratory sinus arrhythmia: RSA) influences on the cardiac function to determine whether coordination is a trait-like between-person characteristic or a state-varying within-person phenomenon, and if so, whether variability in autonomic coordination is modulated by cognitive (P3b amplitude) or affective state. Kindergarten-aged children (n¬†=¬†257) completed a go/no-go task administered in blocks designed to induce affective states through the delivery of reward (Blocks 1 and 3) and frustration (Block 2). Results from multilevel models that allowed for the simultaneous examination of between-person and within-person associations in the repeated measures data suggested that (a) children with higher overall RSA also tended to have higher overall PEP; (b) at within-person level, RSA and PEP tended to be reciprocally coordinated; but that (c) when frustration invokes cognitive disengagement, coordination between parasympathetic and sympathetic systems demonstrate compensatory coordination. These findings highlight the extent to which the coordination of autonomic systems is a dynamic state-like phenomenon rather than a trait-like individual differences characteristic.",

        "Abstract": "Early life exposure to air pollution poses a significant risk to brain development from direct exposure to toxicants or via indirect mechanisms involving the circulatory, pulmonary or gastrointestinal systems. In children, exposure to traffic related air pollution has been associated with adverse effects on cognitive, behavioral and psychomotor development. We aimed to determine whether childhood exposure to traffic related air pollution is associated with regional differences in brain volume and cortical thickness among children enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study of traffic related air pollution and child health. We used magnetic resonance imaging to obtain anatomical brain images from a nested subset of 12 year old participants characterized with either high or low levels of traffic related air pollution exposure during their first year of life. We employed voxel-based morphometry to examine group differences in regional brain volume, and with separate analyses, changes in cortical thickness. Smaller regional gray matter volumes were determined in the left pre- and post-central gyri, the cerebellum, and inferior parietal lobe of participants in the high traffic related air pollution exposure group relative to participants with low exposure. Reduced cortical thickness was observed in participants with high exposure relative to those with low exposure, primarily in sensorimotor regions of the brain including the pre- and post-central gyri and the paracentral lobule, but also within the frontal and limbic regions. These results suggest that significant childhood exposure to traffic related air pollution is associated with structural alterations in brain.",

        "Abstract": "Greenness such as trees, plants, and shrubs may positively influence mental and physical health, but the relationship between greenness and asthma is poorly understood. Because asthma is the most prevalent child respiratory disease internationally, elucidating the role of greenness may substantially benefit public health. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize findings related to effects of greenness on asthma in children. Following PRISMA guidelines, six databases were searched for international publication of primary research results relevant to the relationship between greenness and child asthma. Of 82 initial results, seven articles remained after removal of duplicates and applying exclusion criteria. Six reported no direct association between greenness and child asthma, while one found increased greenness protective for asthma. None found a negative direct association between greenness and child asthma. Evidence supported benefits of greenness on child asthma through mediation of factors such as exposure to tobacco smoke, high traffic volume, and difficult family relationships. Even without a direct association, greenness can be considered a public health asset as it may mediate other factors contributing to asthma in children. Public health nurses can use these findings to educate clients and partners while advocating for policies to protect greenness.",

        "Title": "Adapting electronic health records-derived phenotypes to claims data: Lessons learned in using limited clinical data for phenotyping.",
        "Abstract": "Algorithms for identifying patients of interest from observational data must address missing and inaccurate data and are desired to achieve comparable performance on both administrative claims and electronic health records data. However, administrative claims data do not contain the necessary information to develop accurate algorithms for disorders that require laboratory results, and this omission can result in insensitive diagnostic code-based algorithms. In this paper, we tested our assertion that the performance of a diagnosis code-based algorithm for chronic kidney disorder (CKD) can be improved by adding other codes indirectly related to CKD (e.g., codes for dialysis, kidney transplant, suspicious kidney disorders). Following the best practices from Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), we adapted an electronic health record-based gold standard algorithm for CKD and then created algorithms that can be executed on administrative claims data and account for related data quality issues. We externally validated our algorithms on four electronic health record datasets in the OHDSI network. Compared to the algorithm that uses CKD diagnostic codes only, positive predictive value of the algorithms that use additional codes was slightly increased (47.4% vs. 47.9-48.5% respectively). The algorithms adapted from the gold standard algorithm can be used to infer chronic kidney disorder based on administrative claims data. We succeeded in improving the generalizability and consistency of the CKD phenotypes by using data and vocabulary standardized across the OHDSI network, although performance variability across datasets remains. We showed that identifying and addressing coding and data heterogeneity can improve the performance of the algorithms.",

This laboratory has shown that bovine growth hormone (bGH) also has a catalytic function, i.e. peptidylglycine monooxygenase activity, which is the first step in the alpha-amidation of glycine-extended peptides. We report here that the peptidylglycine monooxygenase activity of monomeric bovine pituitary GH, in the presence of ascorbate, is stimulated by combination with oligomeric forms of bGH one of which is a hetero-oligomer with metallothionein. Three species of recombinant monomeric GH (bovine, human and chicken) also catalyze this monooxygenase reaction. Tetrahydrobiopterin also functions as a reductant - with a significantly greater turnover than achieved with ascorbate. These findings clarify the role of GH in peptidylglycine monooxygenation and provide an explanation for earlier observations that peptide amidation is not totally obliterated in the absence of ascorbate, in cultured pituitary cells or ",

        "Abstract": "The case-control design is widely used in retrospective database studies, often leading to spectacular findings. However, results of these studies often cannot be replicated, and the advantage of this design over others is questionable. To demonstrate the shortcomings of applications of this design, we replicate two published case-control studies. The first investigates isotretinoin and ulcerative colitis using a simple case-control design. The second focuses on dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and acute pancreatitis, using a nested case-control design. We include large sets of negative control exposures (where the true odds ratio is believed to be 1) in both studies. Both replication studies produce effect size estimates consistent with the original studies, but also generate estimates for the negative control exposures showing substantial residual bias. In contrast, applying a self-controlled design to answer the same questions using the same data reveals far less bias. Although the case-control design in general is not at fault, its application in retrospective database studies, where all exposure and covariate data for the entire cohort are available, is unnecessary, as other alternatives such as cohort and self-controlled designs are available. Moreover, by focusing on cases and controls it opens the door to inappropriate comparisons between exposure groups, leading to confounding for which the design has few options to adjust for. We argue that this design should no longer be used in these types of data. At the very least, negative control exposures should be used to prove that the concerns raised here do not apply.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiologic studies have found air pollution to be causally linked to respiratory health including the exacerbation and development of childhood asthma. Accurately characterizing exposure is paramount in these studies to ensure valid estimates of health effects. Here, we provide a brief overview of the evolution of air pollution exposure assessment ranging from the use of ground-based, single-site air monitoring stations for population-level estimates to recent advances in spatiotemporal models, which use advanced machine learning algorithms and satellite-based data to accurately estimate individual-level daily exposures at high spatial resolutions. In addition, we review recent advances in sensor technology that enable the use of personal monitoring in epidemiologic studies, long-considered the \"holy grail\" of air pollution exposure assessment. Finally, we highlight key advantages and uses of each approach including the generalizability and public health relevance of air pollution models and the accuracy of personal monitors that are useful to guide personalized prevention strategies. Investigators and clinicians interested in the effects of air pollution on allergic disease and asthma should carefully consider the pros and cons of each approach to guide their application in research and practice.",

        "Abstract": "US claims data contain medical data on large heterogeneous populations and are excellent sources for medical research. Some claims data do not contain complete death records, limiting their use for mortality or mortality-related studies. A model to predict whether a patient died at the end of the follow-up time (referred to as the end of observation) is needed to enable mortality-related studies.",

        "Title": "Using high-resolution residential greenspace measures in an urban environment to assess risks of allergy outcomes in children.",
        "Abstract": "Despite reported health benefits of urban greenspace (gs), the epidemiological evidence is less clear for allergic disease. To address a limitation of previous research, we examined the associations of medium- and high-resolution residential gs measures and tree and/or grass canopies with allergic outcomes for children enrolled in the longitudinal cincinnati childhood allergy and air pollution study (ccaaps). We estimated residential gs based on 400‚ÄØm radial buffers around participant addresses (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ478) using the normalized differential vegetation index (ndvi) and land cover-derived urban greenspace (ugs) (tree and grass coverage, combined and separate) at 30‚ÄØm and 1.5-2.5‚ÄØm resolution, respectively. Associations between outdoor aeroallergen sensitization and allergic rhinitis at age 7 and residential gs measures at different exposure windows were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. A 10% increase in ugs-derived grass coverage was associated with an increased risk of sensitization to grass pollens (adjusted odds ratio [aor]: 1.27; 95% confidence interval‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.02-1.58). For each 10% increase in ugs-derived tree canopy coverage, nonstatistically significant decreased odds were found for grass pollen sensitization, tree pollen sensitization, and sensitization to either (aor range‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.87-0.94). Results similar in magnitude to ugs-tree canopy coverage were detected for ndvi and allergic sensitizations. High-resolution (down to 1.5‚ÄØm) gs measures of grass- and tree-covered areas showed associations in opposite directions for different allergy outcomes. These data suggest that measures strongly correlated with tree canopy (e.g., ndvi) may be insufficient to detect health effects associated with proximity to different types of vegetation or help elucidate mechanisms related to specific gs exposure pathways.",

        "Title": "Wearable Ultrafine Particle and Noise Monitoring Sensors Jointly Measure Personal Co-Exposures in a Pediatric Population.",
        "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies have linked both traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and noise to adverse health outcomes, including increased blood pressure, myocardial infarction, and respiratory health. The high correlation between these environmental exposures and their measurement challenges have constrained research on how simultaneous exposure to TRAP and traffic noise interact and possibly enhance each other's effect. The objective of this study was to deploy two novel personal sensors for measuring ultrafine particles (UFP, <100 nm diameter) and noise to concurrently monitor real-time exposures. Personal UFP monitors (PUFP, Enmont, LLC) were paired with NEATVIBEwear‚Ñ¢ (Noise Exposure, Activity-Time and Vibration wearable), a personal noise monitoring device developed by the authors (Douglas Leaffer, Steve Doroff). A field-test of PUFP monitors co-deployed with NEATVIBEwear logged UFP, noise and ambient temperature exposure levels at 1-s resolution in an adolescent population in Cincinnati, OH to measure real-time exposures in microenvironments (transit, home, school). Preliminary results show that the concurrent measurement of noise exposures with UFP is feasible in a sample of physically active adolescent participants. Personal measurements of UFP and noise, measured prospectively in future studies, will enable researchers to investigate the independent and/or joint-effects of these health-relevant environmental exposures.",

        "Abstract": "Variants of the DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism, which have been shown to result in functional differences in dopamine D2 receptors (D2R), have been linked to various externalizing outcomes in adults. However, the neurobiological processes that contribute to these associations are not well understood. The current study investigates gene¬†√ó¬†environment effects on teacher-rated externalizing behaviors and probabilistic decision making in a sample of 333 children (age 9) enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal study. Findings indicate that externalizing behaviors increased as a function of hypoxic exposure only among individuals carrying the A1 (A1+) allele. Results also indicate that willingness to pursue reward under conditions of maximum uncertainty (50% probability) decreased as a function of hypoxic exposure only among A1- individuals. Among A1 carriers, no association between probability decision making and hypoxic exposure emerged. These findings suggest that hypoxia could influence neural development through different biological pathways depending on D2 receptor genotype, and provide insight into the development of individual differences in behavior and decision making.",

Such prescribing would have epidemiologic and clinical implications. Patients with PTD have treatment-resistant depression (TRD) if they do not benefit from ‚â• 2 AD medications taken with reasonable compliance for adequate durations at adequate doses. Some database studies of TRD do not assess AD medication dose and would, therefore, overestimate TRD incidence unless physicians treating PTD patients routinely prescribe AD medications at adequate doses before changing medications.",

        "Abstract": "Concerns over reproducibility in science extend to research using existing healthcare data; many observational studies investigating the same topic produce conflicting results, even when using the same data. To address this problem, we propose a paradigm shift. The current paradigm centres on generating one estimate at a time using a unique study design with unknown reliability and publishing (or not) one estimate at a time. The new paradigm advocates for high-throughput observational studies using consistent and standardized methods, allowing evaluation, calibration and unbiased dissemination to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base. We demonstrate this new paradigm by comparing all depression treatments for a set of outcomes, producing 17‚Äâ718 hazard ratios, each using methodology on par with current best practice. We furthermore include control hypotheses to evaluate and calibrate our evidence generation process. Results show good transitivity and consistency between databases, and agree with four out of the five findings from clinical trials. The distribution of effect size estimates reported in the literature reveals an absence of small or null effects, with a sharp cut-off at ",

Observational studies have often been found to be nonreproducible, however, generating conflicting results even when using the same database to answer the same question. One source of discrepancies is error, both random caused by sampling variability and systematic (for example, because of confounding, selection bias, and measurement error). Only random error is typically quantified but converges to zero as databases become larger, whereas systematic error persists independent from sample size and therefore, increases in relative importance. Negative controls are exposure-outcome pairs, where one believes no causal effect exists; they can be used to detect multiple sources of systematic error, but interpreting their results is not always straightforward. Previously, we have shown that an empirical null distribution can be derived from a sample of negative controls and used to calibrate ",

        "Abstract": "Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) develops in acute decompensation (AD) of cirrhosis and shows high mortality. In critically ill patients, early diagnosis of ACLF could be important for therapeutic decisions (eg, renal replacement, artificial liver support, liver transplantation). This study evaluated fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a marker of mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of ACLF. The study included 154 individuals (112 critically patients and 42 healthy controls) divided into a training and a validation cohort. In the training cohort of 42 healthy controls and 34 critically ill patients (of whom 24 were patients with cirrhosis), levels of FGF21, interleukin (IL) 6, and IL8 were measured. In the validation cohort of 78 patients with cirrhosis, 17 patients were admitted with or developed ACLF during follow-up and underwent daily clinical and nutritional assessment. Levels of FGF21 were higher in critically ill patients, especially in patients with cirrhosis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, FGF21 as well as IL6 and IL8 levels were higher in patients with ACLF, but they did not increase with the severity of ACLF. Interestingly, in the validation cohort, FGF21 was also elevated in the patients who developed ACLF in the next 7 days. In these patients, FGF21 levels were an independent predictor of ACLF presence and development in multivariate analysis together with Child-Pugh score. FGF21 levels had no impact on the survival of critically ill patients with cirrhosis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that FGF21 levels are of specific diagnostic value regarding the presence and development of ACLF in patients admitted to ICU for AD of liver cirrhosis. Further studies are warranted to address pathophysiological and possible therapeutic implications. Liver Transplantation 24 595-605 2018 AASLD.",

        "Title": "Inferring pregnancy episodes and outcomes within a network of observational databases.",
        "Abstract": "Administrative claims and electronic health records are valuable resources for evaluating pharmaceutical effects during pregnancy. However, direct measures of gestational age are generally not available. Establishing a reliable approach to infer the duration and outcome of a pregnancy could improve pharmacovigilance activities. We developed and applied an algorithm to define pregnancy episodes in four observational databases: three US-based claims databases: Truven MarketScan¬Æ Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE), Truven MarketScan¬Æ Multi-state Medicaid (MDCD), and the Optum ClinFormatics¬Æ (Optum) database and one non-US database, the United Kingdom (UK) based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Pregnancy outcomes were classified as live births, stillbirths, abortions and ectopic pregnancies. Start dates were estimated using a derived hierarchy of available pregnancy markers, including records such as last menstrual period and nuchal ultrasound dates. Validation included clinical adjudication of 700 electronic Optum and CPRD pregnancy episode profiles to assess the operating characteristics of the algorithm, and a comparison of the algorithm's Optum pregnancy start estimates to starts based on dates of assisted conception procedures. Distributions of pregnancy outcome types were similar across all four data sources and pregnancy episode lengths found were as expected for all outcomes, excepting term lengths in episodes that used amenorrhea and urine pregnancy tests for start estimation. Validation survey results found highest agreement between reviewer chosen and algorithm operating characteristics for questions assessing pregnancy status and accuracy of outcome category with 99-100% agreement for Optum and CPRD. Outcome date agreement within seven days in either direction ranged from 95-100%, while start date agreement within seven days in either direction ranged from 90-97%. In Optum validation sensitivity analysis, a total of 73% of algorithm estimated starts for live births were in agreement with fertility procedure estimated starts within two weeks in either direction; ectopic pregnancy 77%, stillbirth 47%, and abortion 36%. An algorithm to infer live birth and ectopic pregnancy episodes and outcomes can be applied to multiple observational databases with acceptable accuracy for further epidemiologic research. Less accuracy was found for start date estimations in stillbirth and abortion outcomes in our sensitivity analysis, which may be expected given the nature of the outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "We explored how drug switching impacts adherence measures for common chronic oral medications. Switching between ingredients with the same indication was detected within a 30-day grace period. The proportion of days covered (PDC) and adherent status (cutoff 0.8) for each ingredient was calculated and compared between different censoring approaches: censoring drug switching (PDCswitch), censoring the end of dispensing (PDCend), and fixed 365-day period (PDC365). Overall, 854,380 (15.9%) patients in the Optum ClinFormatics (Optum) and 150,785 (22.0%) patients in the MarketScan Multi-state Medicaid (MDCD) had at least one switch within one year. Compared with PDC365 in Optum, PDCswitch means were higher: 0.85 vs. 0.41 for antihypertensive, 0.82 vs. 0.46 for antihyperglycemics, and 0.84 vs. 0.33 for antihyerlipidemia. Further, the percentages of adherent patients were higher: 95.8% vs. 17.9% for antihypertensive, 85.5% vs. 18.9% for antihyperglycemics, and 72.1% vs. 5.3% for antihyerlipidemia. Significant and modest changes were observed between PDCswitch and PDCend.",

        "Abstract": "Exposure assessment for elemental components of particulate matter (PM) using land use modeling is a complex problem due to the high spatial and temporal variations in pollutant concentrations at the local scale. Land use regression (LUR) models may fail to capture complex interactions and non-linear relationships between pollutant concentrations and land use variables. The increasing availability of big spatial data and machine learning methods present an opportunity for improvement in PM exposure assessment models. In this manuscript, our objective was to develop a novel land use random forest (LURF) model and compare its accuracy and precision to a LUR model for elemental components of PM in the urban city of Cincinnati, Ohio. PM smaller than 2.5 ",

Prior observational studies estimating the risks associated with paracetamol use acknowledge the inherent limitations of these studies. One threat to the validity of observational studies is channeling bias, i.e. the notion that patients are systematically exposed to one drug or the other, based on current and past comorbidities, in a manner that affects estimated relative risk.",

While personal injury has been the focus of most epidemiologic investigations regarding ORV use to date, other health effects associated with ORV use have not been adequately examined. ORVs have been designed to operate in rugged, unpaved terrain, and ORVs can produce copious amounts of fugitive dust. ORV use in geographic regions with naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) and erionite (NOE) may result in the liberation of these minerals from underlying rocks and soil, which may put ORV participants at risk to potentially hazardous inhalation exposures.",

        "Abstract": "In localities with combined sewer systems, combined sewer overflow (CSO) events frequently occur following high precipitation and can result in the release of untreated sewage and industrial wastewater into surface waters. We hypothesized that either direct contact with or proximity to aerosolized CSO effluent would increase the risk for childhood emergency department (ED) visits for asthma, gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses, and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in Cincinnati, OH, USA. ED visits for 2010-2014 due to GI diseases, asthma, and SSTIs were extracted from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center electronic health records. The location and timing of CSO events were obtained from the Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) of Greater Cincinnati. ED visits with a residential address within 500m of a CSO site were used in a case-control crossover study with two bi-directional control periods. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk of an ED visit associated with a CSO event at lag periods of 0 to 7days. Statistically significant elevated risks for GI-related ED visits was observed two (OR: 1.16 [95% CI 1.04,1.30]) days after CSO events. CSO events were not significantly associated with asthma- or SSTI-related ED visits, but show similar trends. Our findings suggest an increased risk for GI-related ED visits following CSO events among children who reside near CSO sites.",

        "Abstract": "Recent adverse event reports have raised the question of increased angioedema risk associated with exposure to levetiracetam. To help address this question, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics research network conducted a retrospective observational new-user cohort study of seizure patients exposed to levetiracetam (n = 276,665) across 10 databases. With phenytoin users (n = 74,682) as a comparator group, propensity score-matching was conducted and hazard ratios computed for angioedema events by per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses. Angioedema events were rare in both the levetiracetam and phenytoin groups (54 vs. 71 in per-protocol and 248 vs. 435 in intent-to-treat). No significant increase in angioedema risk with levetiracetam was seen in any individual database (hazard ratios ranging from 0.43 to 1.31). Meta-analysis showed a summary hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-1.31) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.52-0.79) for the per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses, respectively. The results suggest that levetiracetam has the same or lower risk for angioedema than phenytoin, which does not currently carry a labeled warning for angioedema. Further studies are warranted to evaluate angioedema risk across all antiepileptic drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Health disparities, which can be understood as disadvantages in health associated with one's social, racial, economic, or physical environment, originate in childhood and persist across an individual's life course. One's neighborhood may drive or influence these disparities. Information on neighborhoods that can characterize their risks-what we call place-based risks-is rarely used in patient care. Community-level data, however, could inform and personalize interventions such as arranging for mold removal from the home of a person with asthma from the moment that person's address is recorded at the site of care. Efficient risk identification could lead to the tailoring of recommendations and targeting of resources, to improve care experiences and clinical outcomes while reducing disparities and costs. In this article we highlight how data on place-based social determinants of health from national and local sources could be incorporated more directly into patient-centered care, adding precision to risk assessment and mitigation. We also discuss how this information could stimulate cross-sector interventions that promote health equity: the attainment of the highest level of health for neighborhoods, patient panels, and individuals. Finally, we draw attention to research questions that focus on the role of geographical place at the bedside.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trials often lack power to identify rare adverse drug events (ADEs) and therefore cannot address the threat rare ADEs pose, motivating the need for new ADE detection techniques. Emerging national patient claims and electronic health record databases have inspired post-approval early detection methods like the Bayesian self-controlled case series (BSCCS) regression model. Existing BSCCS models do not account for multiple outcomes, where pathology may be shared across different ADEs. We integrate a pathology hierarchy into the BSCCS model by developing a novel informative hierarchical prior linking outcome-specific effects. Considering shared pathology drastically increases the dimensionality of the already massive models in this field. We develop an efficient method for coping with the dimensionality expansion by reducing the hierarchical model to a form amenable to existing tools. Through a synthetic study we demonstrate decreased bias in risk estimates for drugs when using conditions with different true risk and unequal prevalence. We also examine observational data from the MarketScan Lab Results dataset, exposing the bias that results from aggregating outcomes, as previously employed to estimate risk trends of warfarin and dabigatran for intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding. We further investigate the limits of our approach by using extremely rare conditions. This research demonstrates that analyzing multiple outcomes simultaneously is feasible at scale and beneficial.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine whether atopy and other clinical and environmental variables predict the risk of childhood habitual snoring (HS) in a birth cohort born to atopic parents. Participants completed clinical evaluations and questionnaires at ages 1-4 and age 7. HS was defined as snoring ‚â•3 nights/week. Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure was estimated using land-use regression. The association between early (‚â§age 4) and current (age 7) allergic disease, environmental exposures, and snoring at age 7 was examined using adjusted logistic regression. Of the 609 children analyzed the prevalence of HS at age 7 was 21%. Early tobacco smoke exposure [environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)] [odds ratio (OR) 1.79, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.12-2.84], rhinitis (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.06-2.92), wheezing (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.05-2.53), maternal HS (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.36-3.18), and paternal HS (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.14-3.00) were significantly associated with HS at age 7. Current TRAP (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.13-3.26), respiratory infections (OR 1.16, 95% 1.03-1.35), maternal HS (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.69-4.84), and paternal HS (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.82-5.09) were significantly associated with HS at age 7. To our knowledge, this is the largest birth cohort examining longitudinal predictors of snoring in children born to atopic parents. Parental HS was the only variable consistently associated with childhood HS from ages 1 to 7. Early rhinitis, early ETS exposure, and concurrent traffic pollution exposure increased the risk of HS at age 7, while aeroallergen sensitization did not. Children with these characteristics should be considered for screening of sleep disorders.",

Participants were 31 registered forum users and 10 forum moderators. Findings were based on content analysis of 238 messages posted across 28 distinct discussion threads over 12 consecutive months. Nine different types of interaction were identified. In each case the function of the interaction was identified (e.g., to relay personal experiences or solicit opinions of others) and illustrated using quotations from the data set. Online discussion forums that are facilitated by trained moderators offer a safe space for young people to disclose personal information and express their emotions in respect of romantic relationship breakup. Online interactions are rich in empathy and peer support is evident among visitors to such forums.",

        "Abstract": "Randomized controlled trials can benefit from proactive assessment of how well their participant selection strategies during the design of eligibility criteria can influence the study generalizability. In this paper, we present a quantitative metric called generalizability index for study traits 2.0 (GIST 2.0) to assess the a priori generalizability (based on population representativeness) of a clinical trial by accounting for the dependencies among multiple eligibility criteria. The metric was evaluated on 16 sepsis trials identified from ClinicalTrials.gov, with their adverse event reports extracted from the trial results sections. The correlation between GIST scores and adverse events was analyzed. We found that the GIST 2.0 score was significantly correlated with total adverse events and serious adverse events (weighted correlation coefficients of 0.825 and 0.709, respectively, with P < 0.01). This study exemplifies the promising use of Big Data in electronic health records and ClinicalTrials.gov for optimizing eligibility criteria design for clinical studies.",

        "Abstract": "Observational research promises to complement experimental research by providing large, diverse populations that would be infeasible for an experiment. Observational research can test its own clinical hypotheses, and observational studies also can contribute to the design of experiments and inform the generalizability of experimental research. Understanding the diversity of populations and the variance in care is one component. In this study, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaboration created an international data network with 11 data sources from four countries, including electronic health records and administrative claims data on 250 million patients. All data were mapped to common data standards, patient privacy was maintained by using a distributed model, and results were aggregated centrally. Treatment pathways were elucidated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and depression. The pathways revealed that the world is moving toward more consistent therapy over time across diseases and across locations, but significant heterogeneity remains among sources, pointing to challenges in generalizing clinical trial results. Diabetes favored a single first-line medication, metformin, to a much greater extent than hypertension or depression. About 10% of diabetes and depression patients and almost 25% of hypertension patients followed a treatment pathway that was unique within the cohort. Aside from factors such as sample size and underlying population (academic medical center versus general population), electronic health records data and administrative claims data revealed similar results. Large-scale international observational research is feasible.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiologic studies commonly use residential locations to estimate environmental exposures or community-level characteristics. The impact of residential mobility on these characteristics, however, is rarely considered. The objective of this analysis was to examine the effect of residential mobility on estimates of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), greenspace, and community-level characteristics. All residential addresses were reported from birth through age seven for children enrolled in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study. Exposure to TRAP at each address was estimated using a land use model. Greenspace was estimated using satellite imagery. Indices of neighborhood deprivation and race were created based on socioeconomic-census tract measures. Exposure estimates using the birth record address, the last known address, and the annual address history were used to determine exposure estimation error and bias in the association with asthma at age seven. Overall, 54% of the cohort moved at least once prior to age seven. Each move was separated by a median of 4 miles and associated with a median decrease of 4.4% in TRAP exposure, a 5.3% increase in greenspace, an improved deprivation index, and no change in the race index. Using the birth record address or the last known address instead of the annual address history resulted in exposure misclassification leading to a bias toward the null when associating the exposures with asthma. Using a single address to estimate environmental exposures and community-level characteristics over a time period may result in differential assessment error.",

        "Title": "Analysis of Personal and Home Characteristics Associated with the Elemental Composition of PM2.5 in Indoor, Outdoor, and Personal Air in the RIOPA Study.",
        "Abstract": "The complex mixture of chemicals and elements that constitute particulate matter (PM*) varies by season and geographic location because source contributors differ over time and place. The composition of PM having an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 Œºm (PM2.5) is hypothesized to be responsible, in part, for its toxicity. Epidemiologic studies have identified specific components and sources of PM2.5 that are associated with adverse health outcomes. The majority of these studies use measures of outdoor concentrations obtained from one or a few central monitoring sites as a surrogate for measures of personal exposure. Personal PM2.5 (and its elemental composition), however, may be different from the PM2.5 measured at stationary outdoor sites. The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the relationships between the concentrations of various elements in indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 samples, (2) to identify groups of individuals with similar exposures to mixtures of elements in personal PM2.5 and to examine personal and home characteristics of these groups, and (3) to evaluate whether concentrations of elements from outdoor PM2.5 samples are appropriate surrogates for personal exposure to PM2.5 and its elements and whether indoor PM2.5 concentrations and information about home characteristics improve the prediction of personal exposure. The objectives of the study were addressed using data collected as part of the Relationships of Indoor, Outdoor, and Personal Air (RIOPA) study. The RIOPA study has previously measured the mass concentrations of PM2.5 and its elemental constituents during 48-hour concurrent indoor, outdoor (directly outside the home), and personal samplings in three urban areas (Los Angeles, California; Houston, Texas; and Elizabeth, New Jersey). The resulting data and information about personal and home characteristics (including air-conditioning use, nearby emission sources, time spent indoors, census-tract geography, air-exchange rates, and other information) for each RIOPA participant were downloaded from the RIOPA study database. We performed three sets of analyses to address the study aims. First, we conducted descriptive analyses to describe the relationships between elemental concentrations in the concurrently gathered indoor, outdoor, and personal air samples. We assessed the correlation between personal exposure and indoor concentrations as well as personal exposure and outdoor concentrations of each element and calculated ratios between them. In addition, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) and calculated principal component scores (PCSs) to examine the heterogeneity of the elemental composition and then tested whether the mixture of elements in indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 was significantly different within each study site and across study sites. Secondly, we performed model-based clustering analysis to group RIOPA participants with similar exposures to mixtures of elements in personal PM2.5. We examined the association between cluster membership and the concentrations of elements in indoor and outdoor PM2.5 samples and personal and home characteristics. Finally, we developed a series of linear regression models and random forest models to examine the association between personal exposure to elements in PM2.5 and (1) outdoor measurements, (2) outdoor and indoor measurements, and (3) outdoor and indoor measurements and home characteristics. As we developed each model, the improvement in prediction of personal exposure when including additional information was assessed. Personal exposures to PM2.5 and to most elements were significantly correlated with both indoor and outdoor concentrations, although concentrations in personal samples frequently exceeded those of indoor and outdoor samples. In general, for most PM2.5 elements indoor concentrations were more highly correlated with personal exposure than were outdoor concentrations. PCA showed that the mixture of elements in indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 varied significantly across sample types within each study site and also across study sites within each sample type. Using model-based clustering, we identified seven clusters of RIOPA participants whose personal PM2.5 samples had similar patterns of elemental composition. Using this approach, subsets of RIOPA participants were identified whose personal exposures to PM2.5 (and its elements) were significantly higher than their indoor and outdoor concentrations (and vice versa). The results of linear and random forest regression models were consistent with our correlation analyses and demonstrated that (1) indoor concentrations were more significantly associated with personal exposure than were outdoor concentrations and (2) participant reports of time spent at their home significantly modified many of the associations between indoor and personal concentrations. In linear regression models, the inclusion of indoor concentrations significantly improved the prediction of personal exposures to Ba, Ca, Cl, Cu, K, Sn, Sr, V, and Zn compared with the use of outdoor elemental concentrations alone. Including additional information on personal and home characteristics improved the prediction for only one element, Pb. Our results support the use of outdoor monitoring sites as surrogates of personal exposure for a limited number of individual elements associated with long-range transport and with a few local or indoor sources. Based on our PCA and clustering analyses, we concluded that the overall elemental composition of PM2.5 obtained at outdoor monitoring sites may not accurately represent the elemental composition of personal PM2.5. Although the data used in these analyses compared outdoor PM2.5 composition collected at the home with indoor and personal samples, our results imply that studies examining the complete elemental composition of PM2.5 should be cautious about using data from central outdoor monitoring sites because of the potential for exposure misclassification. The inclusion of personal and home characteristics only marginally improved the prediction of personal exposure for a small number of elements in PM2.5. We concluded that the additional cost and burden of indoor and personal sampling may be justified for studies examining elements because neither outdoor monitoring nor questionnaire data on home and personal characteristics were able to represent adequately the overall elemental composition of personal PM2.5.",

The probe is a combination of graphite electrodes, filter paper, with ethylene glycol and choline chloride as the solvent/electrolyte. Square wave chromatovoltammograms show the probes have a sensitivity for TNT of 0.75 nA/ng and a limit of detection of 100 ng. In addition, by taking advantage of the inherent paper chromatography step, TNT can be separated in both time and cathodic peak potential from 4-amino-dinitrotolene co-spotted on the probe or in soil samples with the presence of methyl parathion as a possible interferent.",

        "Abstract": "The formation of flowers is one of the main model systems to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control developmental processes in plants. Although several studies have explored gene expression during flower development in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana on a genome-wide scale, a continuous series of expression data from the earliest floral stages until maturation has been lacking. Here, we used a floral induction system to close this information gap and to generate a reference dataset for stage-specific gene expression during flower formation.",

        "Abstract": "Distributed data networks representing large diverse populations are an expanding focus of drug safety research. However, interpreting results is difficult when treatment effect estimates vary across datasets (i.e., heterogeneity). In a previous study, risk estimates were generated for selected drugs and potential adverse outcomes. Analyses were replicated across eight distributed data sources using an identical analytic structure. To evaluate heterogeneity of risk estimates across data sources, the estimates were combined with summary-level data characterizing the population of each data source. Meta-analysis, meta-regression, and plots of the influence on overall results versus contribution to heterogeneity were examined and used to illustrate an approach to heterogeneity assessment. Heterogeneity, as measured by the I-squared statistic, was high with variability across outcomes. Plots of the relationship between influence on overall results and contribution to heterogeneity suggest that certain datasets and characteristics were influential but there was variability dependent on the drug and outcome being assessed. Exploratory meta-regression identified many possible influential factors, but may be subject to ecological bias and false positive conclusions. Distributed data network drug safety analyses can produce heterogeneous risk estimates that may not be easily explained. Approaches illustrated here can be useful for research that is subject to similar problems with heterogeneity.",

Truven Health's MarketScan Multistate Medicaid Database compared relapses following switches from RLAI. New user cohorts for these two groups were created on the basis of first incidence of exposure to the 'switched to' drug. Groups were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching. Time-to-event analysis assessed schizophrenia-related hospital/emergency department visits. A total of 188 patients switched from RLAI to PP, and 131 patients switched from RLAI to oral AP. Propensity score-matched cohort included 109 patients who switched to PP and 109 patients who switched to an oral AP. Patients who switched from RLAI to PP had fewer events (26 vs. 32), longer time to an event (mean 70 vs. 47 days), and lower risk of relapse (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.92; P=0.024) compared with those who switched from RLAI to oral AP. Switching from RLAI to PP may be associated with a lower risk for relapse and longer duration of therapy compared with switching to oral AP. Given the limitations of observational studies, these results should be confirmed by other prospective evaluations.",

        "Abstract": "The Generalizability Index for Study Traits (GIST) has been proposed recently for assessing the population representativeness of a set of related clinical trials using eligibility features (e.g., age or BMI), one each time. However, GIST has not yet been evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper reports a simulation-based validation study for GIST. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, we demonstrated the effectiveness of GIST at quantifying the population representativeness of a set of related trials that differ in disease domains, study phases, sponsor types, and study designs, respectively. We also showed that among seven example medical conditions, the GIST of age increases from Phase I trials to Phase III trials in the seven disease domains and is the lowest in asthma trials. We concluded that GIST correlates with simulation-based generalizability results and is a valid metric for quantifying population representativeness of related clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "While it is well known that carotid artery dissection can cause hypoglossal palsy, which can cause muscle atrophy and fat tissue replacement in the chronic stage but what is less well known is the acute edematous stage, which can mimic tongue angioedema. We present a case report of a 52-year-old man presented to accident and emergency department with 3 hr history of right-side tongue swelling. He was initially diagnosed with angioedema and treated with corticosteroids and antihistamines. His tongue swelling persisted and subsequently developed unilateral weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the tongue, head, and neck revealed denervation of the right half of the tongue because of injury to hypoglossal nerve during extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection. There was no evidence of ischemic complication of right cerebral artery distribution. He was commenced on antiplatelet therapy to prevent cerebral ischemia as a prophylactic measure. Swelling and weakness of the tongue subsided in the following months. We believe that hypoglossal palsy caused by ICA dissection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with acute tongue swelling.",

        "Abstract": "The entire drug safety enterprise has a need to search, retrieve, evaluate, and synthesize scientific evidence more efficiently. This discovery and synthesis process would be greatly accelerated through access to a common framework that brings all relevant information sources together within a standardized structure. This presents an opportunity to establish an open-source community effort to develop a global knowledge base, one that brings together and standardizes all available information for all drugs and all health outcomes of interest (HOIs) from all electronic sources pertinent to drug safety. To make this vision a reality, we have established a workgroup within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, http://ohdsi.org) collaborative. The workgroup's mission is to develop an open-source standardized knowledge base for the effects of medical products and an efficient procedure for maintaining and expanding it. The knowledge base will make it simpler for practitioners to access, retrieve, and synthesize evidence so that they can reach a rigorous and accurate assessment of causal relationships between a given drug and HOI. Development of the knowledge base will proceed with the measureable goal of supporting an efficient and thorough evidence-based assessment of the effects of 1,000 active ingredients across 100 HOIs. This non-trivial task will result in a high-quality and generally applicable drug safety knowledge base. It will also yield a reference standard of drug-HOI pairs that will enable more advanced methodological research that empirically evaluates the performance of drug safety analysis methods.",

        "Abstract": "The use of healthcare databases for comparative effectiveness research (CER) is increasing exponentially despite its challenges. Researchers must understand their data source and whether outcomes, exposures and confounding factors are captured sufficiently to address the research question. They must also assess whether bias and confounding can be adequately minimized. Many study design characteristics may impact on the results; however, minimal if any sensitivity analyses are typically conducted, and those performed are post hoc. We propose pre-study steps for CER feasibility assessment and to identify sensitivity analyses that might be most important to pre-specify to help ensure that CER produces valid interpretable results.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate sex differences in proximate mechanisms that precede the termination of conflicts. In Study 1, we asked women and men to report their intensity of anger in response to hypothetical, common transgressions involving a same-sex roommate. Direct verbal and physical aggression elicited the highest-intensity anger for both sexes, although overall women reported more intense anger than men to all transgressions. In Study 2, we examined sex differences in subjective and physiological reactions to a conflict using a role-playing scenario. Following recall of a conflict involving direct aggression and role-playing a reaction to it, compared with men, women reported their anger would dissipate less quickly and they would take longer to reconcile. Women also exhibited increased heart rate, but little change in cortisol, whereas men exhibited little change in heart rate but increased cortisol production. We interpret the results as indicating that women are less prepared than men to resolve a conflict with a same-sex peer.",

However, the rates of drug exposure and outcome occurrences in observational databases, the database size and the desired risk detection threshold determine the power and therefore limit the feasibility of the application of appropriate analytical methods. Drugs vary dramatically for these parameters because of their prevalence of indication, cost, time on the market, payer formularies, market pressures and clinical guidelines.",

LGPS applies Bayesian shrinkage to an estimated incidence rate ratio, and LEOPARD aims to detect and discard associations due to protopathic bias.
