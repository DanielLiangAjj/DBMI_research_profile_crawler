        "Abstract": "The term neuronutrition has been proposed as part of nutritional neuroscience, studying the effects of various dietary components on behavior and cognition. Other researchers underline that neuronutrition includes the use of various nutrients and diets to prevent and treat neurological disorders. The aim of this narrative review was to explore the current understanding of the term neuronutrition as the key concept for brain health, its potential molecular targets, and perspectives of its nutritional approach to the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis, anxiety, depressive disorders, migraine, and chronic pain. Neuronutrition can be defined as a part of neuroscience that studies the influence of various aspects of nutrition (nutrients, diet, eating behavior, food environment, etc.) on the development of nervous disorders and includes nutrition, clinical dietetics, and neurology. There is evidence that the neuronutritional approach can influence neuroepigenetic modifications, immunological regulation, metabolic control, and behavioral patterns. The main molecular targets in neuronutrition include neuroinflammation, oxidative/nitrosative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, gut-brain axis disturbance, and neurotransmitter imbalance. To effectively apply neuronutrition for maintaining brain health, a personalized approach is needed, which includes the adaptation of the scientific findings to the genetic, biochemical, psycho-physiological, and environmental features of each individual.",

        "Abstract": "All nations which have undergone a nutrition transition have experienced increased frequency and falling latency of chronic degenerative diseases, which are largely driven by chronic inflammatory stress. Dietary supplementation is a valid strategy to reduce the risk and severity of such disorders. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endocannabinoid-like lipid mediator with extensively documented anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects. It is well tolerated and devoid of side effects in animals and humans. PEA's actions on multiple molecular targets while modulating multiple inflammatory mediators provide therapeutic benefits in many applications, including immunity, brain health, allergy, pain modulation, joint health, sleep and recovery. PEA's poor oral bioavailability, a major obstacle in early research, has been overcome by advanced delivery systems now licensed as food supplements. This review summarizes the functionality of PEA, supporting its use as an important dietary supplement for lifestyle management.",

Purification of fish oil removes lipophilic polyphenols which likely contribute to the health benefits of oily fish; leaving the ω3 highly unsaturated fatty acids exposed and prone to conferring oxidative and inflammatory stress. The authors believe that due to such issues as dietary shift, it may now be inadvisable to prescribe or sell purified ω3 highly unsaturated fatty acids supplements, unless the appropriate co-factors are included.",

        "Abstract": "The Arden Syntax originated in the 1980's, when several knowledge-based systems began to show promise, but researchers recognized the burden of recreating these systems at every institution. Derived initially from Health Evaluation through Logical Processing (HELP) and the Regenstrief Medical Record System (RMRS), the Arden Syntax defines medical logic that can be encoded as independent rules, such as reminders and alerts, with the hope of creating a public library of rules. It was first vetted at an informatics retreat held in 1989 at Columbia University's Arden Homestead. The syntax was intended to be readable by clinician experts but to provide powerful array processing, which was derived largely a programming language called APL. The syntax was improved and implemented by a number of researchers and vendors in the early 1990's and was initially adopted by the consensus standards organization, the American Society for Testing and Materials.",

New therapeutic targets are being identified and investigated, including approaches that may overcome resistance, interrupt bacterial communication, and enhance human immune function. Immune function is negatively affected by type B malnutrition (multiple micronutrient depletion), \"pathological hygiene\" (removal of innate immune primers such as yeasts from the food chain), the removal of innate primers such as yeasts from the food chain, HIV infection, diabetes, chronic stress and depressive illness, and the use of immunosuppressant medications. These and other forms of innate immune dysfunction can be overcome / compensated for by novel therapeutic tools which enhance or mimic different aspects of innate immune function, and which re-configure and reinforce Claude Bernard's milieu interieur.",

        "Abstract": "Analysis of the mid-Victorian period in the U.K. reveals that life expectancy at age 5 was as good or better than exists today, and the incidence of degenerative disease was 10% of ours. Their levels of physical activity and hence calorific intakes were approximately twice ours. They had relatively little access to alcohol and tobacco; and due to their correspondingly high intake of fruits, whole grains, oily fish and vegetables, they consumed levels of micro- and phytonutrients at approximately ten times the levels considered normal today. This paper relates the nutritional status of the mid-Victorians to their freedom from degenerative disease; and extrapolates recommendations for the cost-effective improvement of public health today.",

In order to be effective, such systems require detailed patient-specific clinical information in a form easily reviewed by clinicians. We have developed a patient summary worksheet for use in outpatient clinics, which presents a structured overview of patient health information. The worksheet provides patient demographic information, specific problems and conditions, the patient's current medication profile, laboratory test results pertinent to patient problems, and disease-specific or preventive care actionable advisories. Usage has grown from a few hundred to over 25,000 unique patients per month during a two-year period. Diabetic patients for whom the worksheet is accessed are significantly more likely to be in compliance with accepted testing regimens for glycosolated hemoglobin (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.28, 1.61).",

        "Abstract": "At Intermountain Health Care, we evaluated whether physicians in an ambulatory setting will voluntarily choose to enter data directly into an electronic health record (EHR). In this paper we describe the benefits of an EHR, as they exist in the current IHC application and the ways in which we have sought to minimize obstacles to physician data entry. Currently, of 472 IHC employed physicians, 321 (68%) routinely enter some data directly into the EHR without coercion. Twenty-five percent (80/321) of the physicians use voice recognition for some data entry. Twelve of our 95 ambulatory clinics have voluntarily adopted measures to eliminate paper charts. Of the 212 physicians who entered data in 2004, sixty-nine physicians (22%) increased their level of data entry, while 12 (6%) decreased. We conclude that physicians will voluntarily adopt an EHR system, and will continue and even increase use after implementation barriers are addressed.",

        "Title": "Implementing a multidisease chronic care model in primary care using people and technology.",
        "Abstract": "Management of chronic disease is performed inadequately in the United States in spite of the availability of beneficial, effective therapies. Successful programs to manage patients with these diseases must overcome multiple challenges, including the recognized fragmentation and complexity of the healthcare system, misaligned incentives, a focus on acute problems, and a lack of team-based care. In many successful programs, care is provided in settings or episodes that focus on a single disease. While these programs may allow for streamlined, focused provision of care, comprehensive care for multiple diseases may be more difficult. At Intermountain Healthcare (Intermountain), a generalist model of chronic disease management was formulated to overcome the limitations associated with specialization. In the Intermountain approach, which reflects elements of the Chronic Care Model (CCM), care managers located within multipayer primary care clinics collaborate with physicians, patients, and other members of a primary care team to improve patient outcomes for a variety of conditions. An important part of the intervention is widespread use of an electronic health record (EHR). This EHR provides flexible access to clinical data, individualized decision support designed to encourage best practice for patients with a variety of diseases (including co-occurring ones), and convenient communication between providers. This generalized model is used to treat diverse patients with disparate and coexisting chronic conditions. Early results from the application of this model show improved patient outcomes and improved physician productivity. Success factors, challenges, and obstacles in implementing the model are discussed.",
