CMEC was measured in 1626 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants in samples obtained between 2000 and 2002 as part of two nested case-control studies, one with cases of incident cardiovascular disease and the other with cases of carotid plaque progression by ultrasound. Cardiac CT examinations for the presence of CAC were performed at baseline and at two additional examinations. CAC scores (Agatston and volume) and density scores (for those with positive CAC) were calculated. Multivariable linear regression modeling per SD increment of CMEC was used to estimate the associations of CMEC with each of these CAC measures. We found no association between higher CMEC and either lower CAC scores or a higher CAC density. We also found no association between higher CMEC and progression of any of these CAC measures. These findings suggest that HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux may be associated with cardiovascular risk via mechanisms unrelated to burden of calcified plaque.",

        "Title": "The endogenous circadian system worsens asthma at night independent of sleep and other daily behavioral or environmental cycles.",
        "Abstract": "Asthma often worsens at night. To determine if the endogenous circadian system contributes to the nocturnal worsening of asthma, independent of sleep and other behavioral and environmental day/night cycles, we studied patients with asthma (without steroid use) over 3 wk in an ambulatory setting (with combined circadian, environmental, and behavioral effects) and across the circadian cycle in two complementary laboratory protocols performed in dim light, which separated circadian from environmental and behavioral effects: 1) a 38-h \"constant routine,\" with continuous wakefulness, constant posture, 2-hourly isocaloric snacks, and 2) a 196-h \"forced desynchrony\" incorporating seven identical recurring 28-h sleep/wake cycles with all behaviors evenly scheduled across the circadian cycle. Indices of pulmonary function varied across the day in the ambulatory setting, and both laboratory protocols revealed significant circadian rhythms, with lowest function during the biological night, around 4:00 AM, uncovering a nocturnal exacerbation of asthma usually unnoticed or hidden by the presence of sleep. We also discovered a circadian rhythm in symptom-based rescue bronchodilator use (β2-adrenergic agonist inhaler) whereby inhaler use was four times more likely during the circadian night than day. There were additive influences on asthma from the circadian system plus sleep and other behavioral or environmental effects. Individuals with the lowest average pulmonary function tended to have the largest daily circadian variations and the largest behavioral cycle effects on asthma. When sleep was modeled to occur at night, the summed circadian, behavioral/environmental cycle effects almost perfectly matched the ambulatory data. Thus, the circadian system contributes to the common nocturnal worsening of asthma, implying that internal biological time should be considered for optimal therapy.",

The overall day-night patterns in most CV variables result from the summation of predictable circadian effects with variable behavioral and environmental effects on the CV system. The circadian system has also been implicated in the morning peak in the incidence of adverse CV events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death. We discuss the resting and stress-reactive circadian control of CV physiology in humans and suggest future research opportunities, including improving CV therapy by optimally timing therapy relative to a person's internal body clock time.",

        "Abstract": "In humans, there is an endogenous, near 24-h (i.e., circadian) variation in mood with the best mood occurring during the circadian day and the worst mood occurring during the circadian night. Only positive affect, and not negative affect, has been shown to contribute to this circadian rhythm. We discovered a sharp circadian peak in negative affect during the circadian night coincident with a circadian trough in positive affect. These findings may help explain the association of depression with insomnia, the increased risk of suicide with nocturnal wakefulness, and the correlation between circadian misalignment and symptom severity in Major Depressive Disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and a change in the 24 h pattern of adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. Adverse cardiovascular events occur more frequently in the middle of the night in people with OSA, earlier than the morning prevalence of these events in the general population. It is unknown if these changes are associated with a change in the underlying circadian rhythms, independent of behaviors such as sleep, physical activity, and meal intake. In this exploratory analysis, we studied the endogenous circadian rhythms of blood pressure, heart rate, melatonin and cortisol in 11 participants (48 ± 4 years; seven with OSA) throughout a 5 day study that was originally designed to examine circadian characteristics of obstructive apnea events. After a baseline night, participants completed 10 recurring 5 h 20 min behavioral cycles divided evenly into standardized sleep and wake periods. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in a relaxed semirecumbent posture 15 minutes after each scheduled wake time. Salivary melatonin and cortisol concentrations were measured at 1-1.5 h intervals during wakefulness. Mixed-model cosinor analyses were performed to determine the rhythmicity of all variables with respect to external time and separately to circadian phases (aligned to the dim light melatonin onset, DLMO). The circadian rhythm of blood pressure peaked much later in OSA compared to control participants (group × circadian phase, ",

        "Abstract": "Sleep is critical to employees' health and well-being, safety, and performance at work. Sleep leadership refers to supervisor behaviors that aim to improve employees' sleep, such as showing concern for the quantity and quality of employees' sleep. Using a sample of 180 employees and their 91 supervisors working as full-time National Guard military service members, we examined the relationship of sleep leadership and family-supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSB) to employees' sleep. As outcomes we measured objective sleep quality and quantity using validated wrist actigraphy methods, as well as self-reported sleep hygiene, subjective sleep quantity, and subjective sleep quality (sleep disturbance and sleep-related impairment). As a novel contribution to the literature, we included both supervisors' self-reports and employees' reports of supervisors' engagement in sleep leadership and FSSB. Contradicting our hypotheses, our results show that higher employee ratings of FSSB were related to shorter objective sleep time. Regarding self-reported sleep outcomes, higher employees' ratings of sleep leadership were associated with less sleep disturbance and less sleep-related impairment among employees. Higher supervisors' self-ratings of FSSB, in turn, were related to better sleep hygiene and less sleep-related impairment among employees. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of supportive supervisor behaviors for employees' sleep quality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",

        "Abstract": "Objective- Adverse cardiovascular events occur more frequently in the morning than at other times of the day. Vascular endothelial function (VEF)-a robust cardiovascular risk marker-is impaired during this morning period. We recently discovered that this morning impairment in VEF is not caused by either overnight sleep or the inactivity that accompanies sleep. We determined whether the endogenous circadian system is responsible for this morning impairment in VEF. We also assessed whether the circadian system affects mechanistic biomarkers, that is, oxidative stress (malondialdehyde adducts), endothelin-1, blood pressure, and heart rate. Approach and Results- Twenty-one (11 women) middle-aged healthy participants completed a 5-day laboratory protocol in dim light where all behaviors, including sleep and activity, and all physiological measurements were evenly distributed across the 24-hour period. After baseline testing, participants underwent 10 recurring 5-hour 20-minute behavioral cycles of 2-hour 40-minute sleep opportunities and 2 hours and 40 minutes of standardized waking episodes. VEF, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured, and venous blood was sampled immediately after awakening during each wake episode. Independent of behaviors, VEF was significantly attenuated during the subjective night and across the morning ( P=0.04). Malondialdehyde adducts and endothelin-1 exhibited circadian rhythms with increases across the morning vulnerable period and peaks around noon ( P≤0.01). Both systolic ( P=0.005) and diastolic blood pressure ( P=0.04) were rhythmic with peaks in the late afternoon. Conclusions- The endogenous circadian system impairs VEF and increases malondialdehyde adducts and endothelin-1 in the morning vulnerable hours and may increase the risk of morning adverse cardiovascular events in susceptible individuals.

        "Abstract": "The risk for adverse cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death) peaks in the morning, possibly due to the effects of the endogenous circadian system on cardiovascular risk factors, or the occurrence in the morning of specific triggers, such as mental stress. To assess any interacting effects on cardiovascular function of mental stress and the circadian system, 12 healthy adults underwent a 240-h protocol with all measurements and behaviors scheduled evenly across the circadian cycle. Mental stress was repeatedly induced by performance-motivated serial addition tasks. Cardiovascular measures included hemodynamic function (heart rate, blood pressure), circulating catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine), and estimates of sympathovagal balance and cardiac vagal modulation derived from heart rate variability analyses. Mental stress increased hemodynamic function, sympathovagal balance and epinephrine, and decreased cardiac vagal modulation. Endogenous circadian variation occurred in all cardiovascular measures: sympathovagal balance peaked in the circadian morning (∼9 AM), cardiac vagal modulation in the circadian night (∼4 AM), and heart rate and circulating catecholamines in the late circadian morning/early afternoon (∼12 PM). Importantly, the effects of mental stress and the endogenous circadian system on cardiovascular function occurred in conjunction, such that mental stress in the circadian morning caused greatest sympathovagal balance. This summation of effects could contribute to the increased morning cardiovascular vulnerability.",

        "Abstract": "Objective- To assess the role of HDL (high-density lipoprotein)-mediated cholesterol mass efflux capacity (CMEC) in incident cardiovascular disease and carotid plaque progression. Approach and Results- We measured CMEC in 2 cohorts aged 45 to 84 years at baseline derived from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Cohort 1 comprised 465 cases with incident cardiovascular disease events during 10 years of follow-up and 465 age- and sex-matched controls; cohort 2 comprised 407 cases with progression of carotid plaque measured by ultrasonography at 2 exams >10 years and 407 similarly matched controls. Covariates and outcome events were ascertained according to the MESA protocol. CMEC level was modestly correlated with HDL cholesterol ( R=0.13; P<0.001) but was not associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use, smoking status, or statin use. Higher CMEC level was significantly associated with lower odds of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio, 0.82 per SD of CMEC [95% CI, 0.69-0.98; P=0.031] in the fully adjusted model) in cohort 1 but higher odds of carotid plaque progression (odds ratio, 1.24 per SD of CMEC [95% CI, 1.04-1.48; P=0.018] in the fully adjusted model) in cohort 2 but without dose-response effect. In subgroup analysis within cohort 1, higher CMEC was associated with lower risk of incident coronary heart disease events (odds ratio, 0.72 per SD of CMEC (95% CI, 0.5-0.91; P=0.007) while no association was found with stroke events. Conclusions- These findings support a role for HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux in an atheroprotective mechanism for coronary heart disease but not stroke.",

        "Abstract": "Measurements of aldosterone for diagnosis of primary aldosteronism are usually made from blood sampled in the morning when aldosterone typically peaks. We tested the relative contributions and interacting influences of the circadian system, ongoing behaviors, and prior sleep to this morning peak in aldosterone. To determine circadian rhythmicity and separate effects of behaviors on aldosterone, 16 healthy participants completed a 5-day protocol in dim light while all behaviors ranging from sleep to exercise were standardized and scheduled evenly across the 24-h circadian period. In another experiment, to test the separate effects of prior nocturnal sleep or the inactivity that accompanies sleep on aldosterone, 10 healthy participants were studied across 2 nights: 1 with sleep and 1 with maintained wakefulness (randomized order). Plasma aldosterone was measured repeatedly in each experiment. Aldosterone had a significant endogenous rhythm ( P < 0.001), rising across the circadian night and peaking in the morning (~8 AM). Activity, including exercise, increased aldosterone, and different behaviors modulated aldosterone differently across the circadian cycle (circadian phase × behavior interaction; P < 0.001). In the second experiment, prior nocturnal sleep and prior rested wakefulness both increased plasma aldosterone ( P < 0.001) in the morning, to the same extent as the change in circadian phases between evening and morning. The morning increase in aldosterone is due to effects of the circadian system plus increased morning activities and not prior sleep or the inactivity accompanying sleep. These findings have implications for the time of and behaviors preceding measurement of aldosterone, especially under conditions of shift work and jet lag.",

        "Abstract": "Adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death, occur more frequently in the morning. Prior studies have shown that vascular endothelial function (VEF), a marker of cardiovascular disease, is attenuated during physical inactivity and declines across the night. We sought to determine whether a morning attenuation in VEF is a result of prior sleep or the inactivity that inevitably accompanies sleep. After 1 wk of a rigorously controlled sleep-wake schedule and behaviors, 10 healthy participants completed a randomized crossover protocol in dim light and constant conditions, incorporating a night of 6 h of sleep opportunity and a night of immobility while they were supine and awake. VEF was measured in the dominant brachial artery as flow mediated dilation (FMD) before and after each 6-h trial. To avoid disturbing sleep and posture of the participants, blood was drawn using a 12-ft catheter from an adjoining laboratory room before, during, and after each 6-h trial, and plasma was analyzed for markers of oxidative stress [malondialdehyde adducts (MDA)], and endothelin-1. Contrary to expectation, both nocturnal sleep and nocturnal inactivity significantly increased FMD ( P < 0.05). There was no significant change in MDA or endothelin-1 within and between trials. Contrary to expectations based on prior studies, we found that overnight sleep or the inactivity that accompanies sleep did not result in attenuation in VEF in the morning hours in healthy people. Thus, it is plausible that the endogenous circadian system, a remaining factor not studied here, is responsible for the commonly observed decline in VEF across the night.",

        "Abstract": "All species organize behaviors to optimally match daily changes in the environment, leading to pronounced activity/rest cycles that track the light/dark cycle. Endogenous, approximately 24-hour circadian rhythms in the brain, autonomic nervous system, heart, and vasculature prepare the cardiovascular system for optimal function during these anticipated behavioral cycles. Cardiovascular circadian rhythms, however, may be a double-edged sword. The normal amplified responses in the morning may aid the transition from sleep to activity, but such exaggerated responses are potentially perilous in individuals susceptible to adverse cardiovascular events. Indeed, the occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death all have daily patterns, striking most frequently in the morning. Furthermore, chronic disruptions of the circadian clock, as with night-shift work, contribute to increased cardiovascular risk. Here we highlight the importance of the circadian system to normal cardiovascular function and to cardiovascular disease, and identify opportunities for optimizing timing of medications in cardiovascular disease.",

        "Abstract": "Brachytherapy (BT), the use of a locally placed or implanted radioactive source for treatment of an adjacent tumor, is an important component in the treatment of patients with both early- and advanced-stage cervical cancer and is increasingly part of the standard treatment protocol. When it is feasible, many radiation oncologists choose to include a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examination for planning BT treatment (ie, an MR imaging examination after placement of the applicator but before radiation dosing). MR imaging provides excellent soft-tissue contrast and allows radiation oncologists to individualize the radiation dose to the target volume and minimize the dose to adjacent organs that are at risk for radiation damage. However, traditionally, the radiology department has not performed imaging studies for planning, and the requirements are different compared with those of standard diagnostic imaging. In addition, many applicators are available for use in BT treatment of cervical cancer, and each must considered separately to determine MR safety and to define the best imaging parameters. Starting and supporting a robust gynecologic BT program includes implementing imaging protocols that are helpful to both radiation oncologists and diagnostic radiologists. By becoming more familiar with this treatment modality and the logistics of imaging patients undergoing BT, radiologists can provide imaging support for colleagues in the radiation oncology department and better care for patients.

We investigated how prior exposure to clinical trials and incentives were associated with likelihood of participation in a vaccine clinical trial through a questionnaire administered to 200 elderly patients in an academic general internal medicine clinic. Wilcoxon signed rank sum test compared likelihood of participation with and without monetary incentives. Logistic regression evaluated characteristics associated with intent to participate in an influenza vaccine trial, adjusted for age, gender, language, and education history. When asked about likelihood of participation if there was monetary compensation, there was a 12.2% absolute increase in those reporting that they would ",

        "Abstract": "Respiration-induced tumor motion is a major obstacle for achieving high-precision radiotherapy of cancers in the thoracic and abdominal regions. Surrogate-based estimation and tracking methods are commonly used in radiotherapy, but with limited understanding of quantified correlation to tumor motion. In this study, we propose a method to simultaneously track the lung tumor and external surrogates to evaluate their spatial correlation in a quantitative way using dynamic MRI, which allows real-time acquisition without ionizing radiation exposure. To capture the lung and whole tumor, four MRI-compatible fiducials are placed on the patient's chest and upper abdomen. Two different types of acquisitions are performed in the sagittal orientation including multi-slice 2D cine MRIs to reconstruct 4D-MRI and two-slice 2D cine MRIs to simultaneously track the tumor and fiducials. A phase-binned 4D-MRI is first reconstructed from multi-slice MR images using body area as a respiratory surrogate and groupwise registration. The 4D-MRI provides 3D template volumes for different breathing phases. 3D tumor position is calculated by 3D-2D template matching in which 3D tumor templates in the 4D-MRI reconstruction and the 2D cine MRIs from the two-slice tracking dataset are registered. 3D trajectories of the external surrogates are derived via matching a 3D geometrical model of the fiducials to their segmentations on the 2D cine MRIs. We tested our method on ten lung cancer patients. Using a correlation analysis, the 3D tumor trajectory demonstrates a noticeable phase mismatch and significant cycle-to-cycle motion variation, while the external surrogate was not sensitive enough to capture such variations. Additionally, there was significant phase mismatch between surrogate signals obtained from the fiducials at different locations.",

In addition, this review explores the evidence for a link between shift work (and its associated disturbances in sleep duration/quality and circadian alignment) and alterations in bone metabolism and bone health.

        "Title": "Influenza Vaccination Beliefs and Practices in Elderly Primary Care Patients.",
        "Abstract": "The majority of influenza related deaths and hospitalizations occur among individuals ≥65 years, yet the national influenza vaccination rate for this group is 63% and is lower in the Hispanic population. Previous studies have described negative predictors of vaccination; however, there is a knowledge gap of how influenza vaccine-specific beliefs affect vaccination rates. We examined the relationship between influenza vaccine health beliefs and vaccination behaviors in a cross sectional sample of 200 primarily Hispanic patients aged ≥65 years in an academic general internal medicine clinic. Participants were asked about perceptions of influenza vaccine effectiveness and safety. Interview responses regarding influenza vaccine concerns were evaluated qualitatively with conventional content analysis. Logistic regression evaluated associations between beliefs and self-reported vaccination the previous year, adjusted for age, gender, and language. Of those approached to complete the questionnaire, 88% participated. Self-reported influenza vaccination rate during the study year was 75%. Only 46.5% endorsed the belief that influenza vaccine is very effective and 47% that it is very safe. Many stated specific concerns about flu vaccine including that it causes side effects/adverse outcomes, is not effective, vaccine components are harmful, and vaccination is not necessary. Belief that the flu shot causes the flu and concern for variability of the flu shot were associated with reduced odds of vaccination (aOR 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.83] and 0.06 [0.006, 0.63] respectively). The patient-perceived distinction between cold, flu, and other symptoms warrants further exploration. This information can be used to develop targeted communication to promote vaccination.",

        "Abstract": "Surrogate-based tumor motion estimation and tracing methods are commonly used in radiotherapy despite the lack of continuous real time 3D tumor and surrogate data. In this study, we propose a method to simultaneously track the tumor and external surrogates with dynamic MRI, which allows us to evaluate their reproducible correlation. Four MRI-compatible fiducials are placed on the patient's chest and upper abdomen, and multi-slice 2D cine MRIs are acquired to capture the lung and whole tumor, followed by two-slice 2D cine MRIs to simultaneously track the tumor and fiducials, all in sagittal orientation. A phase-binned 4D-MRI is first reconstructed from multi-slice MR images using body area as a respiratory surrogate and group-wise registration. The 4D-MRI provides 3D template volumes for different breathing phases. 3D tumor position is calculated by 3D-2D template matching in which 3D tumor templates in 4D-MRI reconstruction and the 2D cine MRIs from the two-slice tracking dataset are registered. 3D trajectories of the external surrogates are derived via matching a 3D geometrical model to the fiducial segmentations on the 2D cine MRIs. We tested our method on five lung cancer patients. Internal target volume from 4D-CT showed average sensitivity of 86.5% compared to the actual tumor motion for 5 min. 3D tumor motion correlated with the external surrogate signal, but showed a noticeable phase mismatch. The 3D tumor trajectory showed significant cycle-to-cycle variation, while the external surrogate was not sensitive enough to capture such variations. Additionally, there was significant phase mismatch between surrogate signals obtained from fiducials at different locations.",

        "Abstract": "Nutcracker syndrome is characterized by abnormal acute angulation of the superior mesenteric artery origin from the aorta, with resulting compression and hypertension of the crossing left renal vein. The radiologic studies used in diagnosis are typically limited to standard cross-sectional anatomic imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, with occasional use of Doppler ultrasound imaging for hemodynamic quantification. The standard for acquiring anatomic and physiologic information continues to be invasive venography. We describe the successful novel application of phase-encoded magnetic resonance imaging as a noninvasive method for acquiring anatomic and hemodynamic data in a case of possible nutcracker syndrome in a young patient.",

        "Abstract": "Depression, chronic stress, and low levels of social support have known associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Physical activity has been shown to promote psychological health, reduce the frequency of depressive symptoms, and is associated with fewer cardiovascular events in depressed subjects with known CVD. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that physical activity attenuates the association between psychosocial factors and incident CVD. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort includes 6,814 participants free of clinical CVD at baseline. Complete data on physical activity were available for 6,795 subjects (mean age 62 years; 47% men). Psychosocial factors were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between psychosocial factors and CVD events and its modulation by physical activity. In models adjusted for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, both depression and chronic burden were associated with CVD events (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.38 [1.04 to 1.84], p = 0.028 for depression; HR = 1.15 [1.05 to 1.24], p = 0.001 for chronic burden). Adjusting for physical activity, the relation between depression, chronic burden, and CVD events was not significantly reduced (HR = 1.35 [1.02 to 1.80], p = 0.039 for depression; HR = 1.14 [1.05 to 1.23], p = 0.001 for chronic burden). Although physical activity is an important component of physical and psychological health and well-being, it did not significantly attenuate the strong relation between depression or chronic burden and incident CVD.",

        "Abstract": "This randomized controlled trial assessed different educational approaches for increasing colorectal cancer screening uptake in a sample of primarily non-US born urban minority individuals, over aged 50, with health insurance, and out of compliance with screening guidelines. In one group, participants were mailed printed educational material (n = 180); in a second, participants' primary care physicians received academic detailing to improve screening referral and follow-up practices (n = 185); in a third, physicians received academic detailing and participants received tailored telephone education (n = 199). Overall, 21.5% of participants (n = 121) received appropriate screening within one year of randomization. There were no statistically significant pairwise differences between groups in screening rate. Among those 60 years of age or older, however, the detailing plus telephone education group had a higher screening rate than the print group (27.3 vs. 7.7%, p = .02). Different kinds of interventions will be required to increase colorectal cancer screening among the increasingly small population segment that remains unscreened.

OSA, the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, has been linked to multiple cardiovascular, metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory derangements and may have adverse effects on bone. However, little is known about how OSA (including the associated hypoxia and sleep loss) affects bone metabolism. In order to gain insight into the relationship between sleep and bone, we review the growing information on OSA and metabolic bone disease and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms by which OSA may affect bone metabolism/architecture.",

        "Abstract": "Although a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of 0 is associated with a very low 10-year risk for cardiac events, this risk is nonzero. Subjects with a family history of coronary heart disease (CHD) has been associated with more subclinical atherosclerosis than subjects without a family history of CHD. The purpose of this study was to assess the significance of a family history for CHD in subjects with a CAC score of 0. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort includes 6,814 participants free of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. Positive family history was defined as reporting a parent, sibling, or child who had a heart attack. Time to incident CHD or CVD event was modeled using the multivariable Cox regression; 3,185 subjects were identified from the original Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort as having a baseline CAC score of 0 (mean age 58 years, 37% men). Over a median follow-up of 10 years, 101 participants (3.2%) had CVD events and 56 (1.8%) had CHD events. In age- and gender-adjusted analyses, a family history of CHD was associated with an ∼70% increase in CVD (hazard ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 2.56) and CHD (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 2.91) events. CVD events remained significant after further adjustment for ethnicity, risk factors, and baseline medication use. In conclusion, asymptomatic subjects with a 0 CAC score and a positive family history of CHD are at increased risk for CVD and CHD events compared with those without a family history of CHD, although absolute event rates remain low.",

        "Title": "Image corruption detection in diffusion tensor imaging for post-processing and real-time monitoring.",
        "Abstract": "Due to the high sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to physiological motion, clinical DTI scans often suffer a significant amount of artifacts. Tensor-fitting-based, post-processing outlier rejection is often used to reduce the influence of motion artifacts. Although it is an effective approach, when there are multiple corrupted data, this method may no longer correctly identify and reject the corrupted data. In this paper, we introduce a new criterion called \"corrected Inter-Slice Intensity Discontinuity\" (cISID) to detect motion-induced artifacts. We compared the performance of algorithms using cISID and other existing methods with regard to artifact detection. The experimental results show that the integration of cISID into fitting-based methods significantly improves the retrospective detection performance at post-processing analysis. The performance of the cISID criterion, if used alone, was inferior to the fitting-based methods, but cISID could effectively identify severely corrupted images with a rapid calculation time. In the second part of this paper, an outlier rejection scheme was implemented on a scanner for real-time monitoring of image quality and reacquisition of the corrupted data. The real-time monitoring, based on cISID and followed by post-processing, fitting-based outlier rejection, could provide a robust environment for routine DTI studies.",

        "Abstract": "Serious adverse cardiovascular events peak in the morning, possibly related to increased thrombosis in critical vessels. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which inhibits fibrinolysis, is a key circulating prothrombotic factor that rises in the morning in humans. We tested whether this morning peak in PAI-1 is caused by the internal circadian system or by behaviors that typically occur in the morning, such as altered posture and physical activity. Twelve healthy adults underwent a 2-week protocol that enabled the distinction of endogenous circadian effects from behavioral and environmental effects. The results demonstrated a robust circadian rhythm in circulating PAI-1 with a peak corresponding to ∼6:30 am. This rhythm in PAI-1 was 8-times larger than changes in PAI-1 induced by standardized behavioral stressors, including head-up tilt and 15-minute cycle exercise. If this large endogenous morning peak in PAI-1 persists in vulnerable individuals, it could help explain the morning peak in adverse cardiovascular events.",

        "Abstract": "Human motor activity has a robust, intrinsic fractal structure with similar patterns from minutes to hours. The fractal activity patterns appear to be physiologically important because the patterns persist under different environmental conditions but are significantly altered/reduced with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report that dementia patients, known to have disrupted circadian rhythmicity, also have disrupted fractal activity patterns and that the disruption is more pronounced in patients with more amyloid plaques (a marker of AD severity). Moreover, the degree of fractal activity disruption is strongly associated with vasopressinergic and neurotensinergic neurons (two major circadian neurotransmitters) in postmortem suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and can better predict changes of the two neurotransmitters than traditional circadian measures. These findings suggest that the SCN impacts human activity regulation at multiple time scales and that disrupted fractal activity may serve as a non-invasive biomarker of SCN neurodegeneration in dementia.",

        "Title": "Fractal patterns of neural activity exist within the suprachiasmatic nucleus and require extrinsic network interactions.",
        "Abstract": "The mammalian central circadian pacemaker (the suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN) contains thousands of neurons that are coupled through a complex network of interactions. In addition to the established role of the SCN in generating rhythms of ~24 hours in many physiological functions, the SCN was recently shown to be necessary for normal self-similar/fractal organization of motor activity and heart rate over a wide range of time scales--from minutes to 24 hours. To test whether the neural network within the SCN is sufficient to generate such fractal patterns, we studied multi-unit neural activity of in vivo and in vitro SCNs in rodents. In vivo SCN-neural activity exhibited fractal patterns that are virtually identical in mice and rats and are similar to those in motor activity at time scales from minutes up to 10 hours. In addition, these patterns remained unchanged when the main afferent signal to the SCN, namely light, was removed. However, the fractal patterns of SCN-neural activity are not autonomous within the SCN as these patterns completely broke down in the isolated in vitro SCN despite persistence of circadian rhythmicity. Thus, SCN-neural activity is fractal in the intact organism and these fractal patterns require network interactions between the SCN and extra-SCN nodes. Such a fractal control network could underlie the fractal regulation observed in many physiological functions that involve the SCN, including motor control and heart rate regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies link short sleep duration and circadian disruption with higher risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. We tested the hypotheses that prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, as can occur in people performing shift work, impairs glucose regulation and metabolism. Healthy adults spent >5 weeks under controlled laboratory conditions in which they experienced an initial baseline segment of optimal sleep, 3 weeks of sleep restriction (5.6 hours of sleep per 24 hours) combined with circadian disruption (recurring 28-hour \"days\"), followed by 9 days of recovery sleep with circadian re-entrainment. Exposure to prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, with measurements taken at the same circadian phase, decreased the participants' resting metabolic rate and increased plasma glucose concentrations after a meal, an effect resulting from inadequate pancreatic insulin secretion. These parameters normalized during the 9 days of recovery sleep and stable circadian re-entrainment. Thus, in humans, prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption alters metabolism and could increase the risk of obesity and diabetes.",

Such adverse cardiovascular events have day/night patterns with peaks in the morning (~9 AM), potentially related to endogenous circadian clock control of platelet activation. The objective was to test if the human endogenous circadian system influences (1) platelet function and (2) platelet response to standardized behavioral stressors. We also aimed to compare the magnitude of any effects on platelet function caused by the circadian system with that caused by varied standardized behavioral stressors, including mental arithmetic, passive postural tilt and mild cycling exercise.",

        "Abstract": "Increased left ventricular (LV) mass and changes in LV geometry may precede hypertension onset. The authors examined the associations of LV mass and geometry, assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, with hypertension incidence in 2,567 normotensive participants enrolled in 2000-2002 in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, an ethnically diverse, population-based, US study. Over a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 745 (29%) participants developed hypertension. In a fully adjusted model including baseline blood pressure, the relative risks of incident hypertension from the lowest to highest LV mass quartile were 1.00 (referent), 1.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89, 1.43), 1.28 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.63), and 1.78 (95% CI: 1.38, 2.30) (P < 0.001 for linear trend). Higher levels of LV concentric geometry, defined by higher LV mass to end-diastolic volume quartiles, were associated with higher risk of incident hypertension in a fully adjusted model (P = 0.044 for linear trend). In a final model containing both quartiles of LV mass and LV mass/volume along with all covariates including baseline blood pressure, higher LV mass quartiles were associated with incident hypertension (P < 0.001 for linear trend), whereas higher LV mass/volume quartiles were not (P = 0.643 for linear trend). In this multiethnic cohort, alterations in LV mass preceded hypertension onset among normotensive individuals.",

        "Abstract": "Caring for persons with diabetes is expensive, and this burden is increasing. Little is known about service use, behaviors, and self-care of older individuals with diabetes who live in underserved communities. Information about self-care, informal care, and service utilization in urban (largely Latino, n = 695) and rural (mostly white, n = 819) Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes living in federally designated medically underserved areas was collected using computer-aided telephone interviews as part of the baseline assessment in the Informatics and Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) Project. Where items were comparable, service use was compared with that of a nationally representative group of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes, using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Compared to nationally representative groups, the underserved groups reported worse general health but similar health care service use, with the exception of home care. However, compared to the underserved rural group, the underserved, largely minority urban group, reported worse general health (P < 0.0001); more inpatient nights (P = 0.003), emergency room visits (P < 0.001), and home health care (P < 0.001); spent more time on self-care; and had more difficulty with housework, meal preparation, and personal care. Differences in service use between urban and rural groups within the underserved group substantially exceeded differences between the underserved and nationally representative groups. These findings address a gap in knowledge about older, ethnically diverse individuals with diabetes living in medically underserved areas. This profile of disparate service use and health care practices among urban minority and rural majority underserved adults with diabetes can assist in the planning of future interventions.",

        "Abstract": "The risk of adverse cardiovascular events peaks in the morning (≈9:00 AM) with a secondary peak in the evening (≈8:00 PM) and a trough at night. This pattern is generally believed to be caused by the day/night distribution of behavioral triggers, but it is unknown whether the endogenous circadian system contributes to these daily fluctuations. Thus, we tested the hypotheses that the circadian system modulates autonomic, hemodynamic, and hemostatic risk markers at rest, and that behavioral stressors have different effects when they occur at different internal circadian phases. Twelve healthy adults were each studied in a 240-h forced desynchrony protocol in dim light while standardized rest and exercise periods were uniformly distributed across the circadian cycle. At rest, there were large circadian variations in plasma cortisol (peak-to-trough ≈85% of mean, peaking at a circadian phase corresponding to ≈9:00 AM) and in circulating catecholamines (epinephrine, ≈70%; norepinephrine, ≈35%, peaking during the biological day). At ≈8:00 PM, there was a circadian peak in blood pressure and a trough in cardiac vagal modulation. Sympathetic variables were consistently lowest and vagal markers highest during the biological night. We detected no simple circadian effect on hemostasis, although platelet aggregability had two peaks: at ≈noon and ≈11:00 PM. There was circadian modulation of the cardiovascular reactivity to exercise, with greatest vagal withdrawal at ≈9:00 AM and peaks in catecholamine reactivity at ≈9:00 AM and ≈9:00 PM. Thus, the circadian system modulates numerous cardiovascular risk markers at rest as well as their reactivity to exercise, with resultant profiles that could potentially contribute to the day/night pattern of adverse cardiovascular events.",

        "Abstract": "Hypertension is associated with impaired endothelial function in cross-sectional studies. However, few longitudinal data exist on whether endothelial dysfunction precedes the development of hypertension. We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between endothelial-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and hypertension prevalence and incidence in 3500 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, an ethnically diverse, community-based cohort study. At baseline, the prevalence ratios (95% CI) of hypertension from the highest to the lowest quartile of FMD were 1.00 (referent), 1.26 (1.12 to 1.40), 1.35 (1.21 to 1.52), and 1.68 (1.50 to 1.87; linear trend P<0.001). This association remained (P=0.017) after adjustment for demographics (age, sex, and ethnicity), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis site, and other risk factors. Of the 1869 participants without hypertension at baseline, 584 (31.3%) developed hypertension over a median follow-up of 4.8 years. The unadjusted relative risks (95% CI) of incident hypertension from the highest to the lowest quartile of FMD were 1.00 (referent), 1.38 (1.14 to 1.67), 1.44 (1.19 to 1.74), and 1.64 (1.36 to 1.97; linear trend P<0.001). However, after adjustment for demographics and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis site, the relationship between FMD and incident hypertension was attenuated and not statistically significant: 1.00 (referent), 1.26 (1.04 to 1.52), 1.19 (0.98 to 1.44), and 1.18 (0.97 to 1.44). The longitudinal results also did not appreciably change after adjustment for additional risk factors and baseline blood pressure levels. In this sample, reduced FMD was not an independent predictor of hypertension incidence, suggesting that impaired endothelial function does not play a major role in the development of hypertension.",

        "Abstract": "Objective To determine whether a diabetes case management telemedicine intervention reduced healthcare expenditures, as measured by Medicare claims, and to assess the costs of developing and implementing the telemedicine intervention. Design We studied 1665 participants in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel), a randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine case management of diabetes to usual care. Participants were aged 55 years or older, and resided in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. Measurements We analyzed Medicare claims payments for each participant for up to 60 study months from date of randomization, until their death, or until December 31, 2006 (whichever happened first). We also analyzed study expenditures for the telemedicine intervention over six budget years (February 28, 2000- February 27, 2006). Results Mean annual Medicare payments (SE) were similar in the usual care and telemedicine groups, $9040 ($386) and $9669 ($443) per participant, respectively (p>0.05). Sensitivity analyses, including stratification by censored status, adjustment by enrollment site, and semi-parametric weighting by probability of dropping-out, rendered similar results. Over six budget years 28 821 participant/months of telemedicine intervention were delivered, at an estimated cost of $622 per participant/month. Conclusion Telemedicine case management was not associated with a reduction in Medicare claims in this medically underserved population. The cost of implementing the telemedicine intervention was high, largely representing special purpose hardware and software costs required at the time. Lower implementation costs will need to be achieved using lower cost technology in order for telemedicine case management to be more widely used.",

For example, adverse cardiovascular incidents peak in the morning, asthma is often worse at night and temporal lobe epileptic seizures are most prevalent in the afternoon. These patterns may be due to the day/night rhythm in environment and behavior, and/or endogenous circadian rhythms in physiology. Furthermore, chronic misalignment between the endogenous circadian timing system and the behavioral cycles could be a cause of increased risk of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers in shift workers. Here we describe the magnitude, relevance and potential biological basis of such daily changes in disease severity and of circadian/behavioral misalignment, and present how these insights may help in the development of appropriate chronotherapy.",

Subjects were recruited from Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Los Angeles County, California; New York, New York; and St. Paul, Minnesota. Levels of depressive symptoms, trait anger, trait anxiety, chronic burdens, emotional support, and cynical distrust were assessed by questionnaire (from July 2000 to July 2002). Digital retinal images (from August 2002 to January 2004) from 6,147 participants were used to evaluate retinopathy and retinal vascular caliber. After controlling for potential confounding factors, the authors found that subjects without access to emotional support (Enriched Social Support Instrument score of <19 vs. > or = 19) had 60% greater odds of retinopathy (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 2.0). Subjects with high Spielberger trait-anxiety scale scores (> or = 22 vs. < or = 14) and subjects with high depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale score, > or = 16 vs. <16) were also more likely to have retinopathy (odds ratio = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.9 and odds ratio = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2, 1.9), respectively. In this cross-sectional study, lack of emotional support, increased trait anxiety, and more depressive symptoms were associated with retinopathy signs, independently of other known risk factors.",

E-selectin level was associated with BMI (R = 0.11; p < 0.02), ponderal index (p < 0.02), waist circumference (p = 0.02), fasting insulin (p < 0.02), and insulin resistance (p < or = 0.05); these associations remained significant after adjustment for age, sex and fasting glucose. sVCAM was also associated with BMI (R = 0.12; p < 0.05).

        "Abstract": "Epileptiform abnormalities often occur at specific times of day or night, possibly attributable to state of consciousness (sleep vs. wake) and/or influences from the endogenous circadian pacemaker. In this pilot study we tested for the existence of circadian variation of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), independent of changes in state, environment, or behavior. Five patients with generalized epilepsy underwent a protocol whereby their sleep/wake schedule was evenly distributed across the circadian cycle while undergoing full-montage electroencephalography and hourly plasma melatonin measurements. Light was <8 lux to prevent circadian entrainment. All patients completed the protocol, testifying to its feasibility. All patients had normal circadian rhythmicity of plasma melatonin relative to their habitual sleep times. In the three patients with sufficient IEDs to assess variability, most IEDs occurred during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (ratio NREM:wake=14:1, P<0.001). In both patients who had NREM at all circadian phases, there was apparent circadian variation in IEDs but with different phases relative to peak melatonin.",

Compared with men, women were 9% less likely to achieve LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dl (adjusted prevalence ratio 0.91 [0.83-0.99]) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) <130 mmHg (adjusted prevalence ratio 0.91 [0.85-0.98]). These differences diminished over time. A lower percentage of women used aspirin (23 vs. 33%; P < 0.001). African American and Hispanic women had higher mean levels of SBP and lower prevalence of aspirin use than non-Hispanic white women. CONCLUSIONS Women with diabetes had unfavorable cardiovascular risk factor profiles compared with men. African American and Hispanic women had less favorable profiles than non-Hispanic white women.",

        "Abstract": "CONTEXT Telemedicine is a promising but largely unproven technology for providing case management services to patients with chronic conditions and lower access to care. OBJECTIVES To examine the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention to achieve clinical management goals in older, ethnically diverse, medically underserved patients with diabetes. DESIGN, Setting, and Patients A randomized controlled trial was conducted, comparing telemedicine case management to usual care, with blinded outcome evaluation, in 1,665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged >/= 55 years, residing in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. Interventions Home telemedicine unit with nurse case management versus usual care. Main Outcome Measures The primary endpoints assessed over 5 years of follow-up were hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure levels. RESULTS Intention-to-treat mixed models showed that telemedicine achieved net overall reductions over five years of follow-up in the primary endpoints (HgbA1c, p = 0.001; LDL, p < 0.001; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, p = 0.024; p < 0.001). Estimated differences (95% CI) in year 5 were 0.29 (0.12, 0.46)% for HgbA1c, 3.84 (-0.08, 7.77) mg/dL for LDL cholesterol, and 4.32 (1.93, 6.72) mm Hg for systolic and 2.64 (1.53, 3.74) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. There were 176 deaths in the intervention group and 169 in the usual care group (hazard ratio 1.01 [0.82, 1.24]). CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine case management resulted in net improvements in HgbA1c, LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure levels over 5 years in medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries. Mortality was not different between the groups, although power was limited. Trial Registration http://clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00271739.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this evaluation was to determine the effect of redesigning the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) telemedicine architecture on the average upload delay and on the average number of glucose uploads to a central database. These two measures positively influence our ability to deliver timely and accurate patient care to the study population. The redesign was also undertaken to improve the patients' experience in using the system and thereby increase the frequency and timeliness of their self-monitoring behavior. Using the total number of glucose uploads, we compared the delay in glucose upload times according to the type of home telemedicine unit the study participants used and the region where the participants lived. The participants were Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes living in medically underserved neighborhoods in New York City and rural Upstate New York. The populations in these two regions differed considerably in terms of ethnicity, language spoken (Spanish, English), and education level. Participants who had Generation 2 (Gen 2) (mean = 10.75, SD +/- 7.96) home telemedicine units had significantly shorter upload delay times (p < 0.001) as measured in days than those participants with Generation 1 (Gen 1) (mean = 22.44, SD +/- 11.18) and those who were upgraded from Gen 1 (mean = 20.67, SD +/- 8.85) to Gen 2 (mean = 14.93, SD +/- 9.37). Additionally, the delay was significantly shorter for participants living upstate (mean = 24.14 days, SD +/- 11.95 days) than downstate (mean = 15.30 days, SD +/- 7.87 days), t (975) = 13.98, p < 0.01. The system redesign made a significant impact in reducing glucose upload delays of IDEATel participants. However, upload delays were significantly impacted by the region where the participants resided.",

        "Title": "Adverse metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of circadian misalignment.",
        "Abstract": "There is considerable epidemiological evidence that shift work is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, perhaps the result of physiologic maladaptation to chronically sleeping and eating at abnormal circadian times. To begin to understand underlying mechanisms, we determined the effects of such misalignment between behavioral cycles (fasting/feeding and sleep/wake cycles) and endogenous circadian cycles on metabolic, autonomic, and endocrine predictors of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk. Ten adults (5 female) underwent a 10-day laboratory protocol, wherein subjects ate and slept at all phases of the circadian cycle-achieved by scheduling a recurring 28-h \"day.\" Subjects ate 4 isocaloric meals each 28-h \"day.\" For 8 days, plasma leptin, insulin, glucose, and cortisol were measured hourly, urinary catecholamines 2 hourly (totaling approximately 1,000 assays/subject), and blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac vagal modulation, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, and polysomnographic sleep daily. Core body temperature was recorded continuously for 10 days to assess circadian phase. Circadian misalignment, when subjects ate and slept approximately 12 h out of phase from their habitual times, systematically decreased leptin (-17%, P < 0.001), increased glucose (+6%, P < 0.001) despite increased insulin (+22%, P = 0.006), completely reversed the daily cortisol rhythm (P < 0.001), increased mean arterial pressure (+3%, P = 0.001), and reduced sleep efficiency (-20%, P < 0.002). Notably, circadian misalignment caused 3 of 8 subjects (with sufficient available data) to exhibit postprandial glucose responses in the range typical of a prediabetic state. These findings demonstrate the adverse cardiometabolic implications of circadian misalignment, as occurs acutely with jet lag and chronically with shift work.",

        "Title": "Reduction of scale invariance of activity fluctuations with aging and Alzheimer's disease: Involvement of the circadian pacemaker.",
        "Abstract": "Human motor control systems orchestrate complex scale-invariant patterns of activity over a wide range of time scales (minutes to hours). The neural mechanisms underlying scale-invariance are unknown in humans. In rats, the master circadian pacemaker [suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)] is crucially involved in scale-invariant activity fluctuations over multiple time scales from minutes to 24 h. Aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with progressive dysfunction of the SCN. Thus, if the SCN is responsible for the scale-invariant activity fluctuations in humans, we predict disturbances of scale-invariant activity fluctuations in elderly humans and even more pronounced disturbances in elderly humans with AD. To test these hypotheses, we studied spontaneous daytime activity patterns in 13 young adults (mean +/- SD: 25.5 +/- 6.1 y); 13 elderly people with early-stage AD (68.5 +/- 6.1 y) matched with 13 elderly controls (68.6 +/- 6.1 y); and 14 very old people with late-stage AD (83.9 +/- 6.7 y) matched with 12 very old controls (80.8 +/- 8.6 y). In young adults, activity exhibited robust scale-invariant correlations across all tested time scales (minutes to 8 h). The scale-invariant correlations at 1.5-8 h declined with age (P = 0.01) and were significantly reduced in the elderly (P = 0.04) and very old controls (P = 0.02). Remarkably, an age-independent AD effect further reduced the scale-invariant correlations at 1.5-8 h (P = 0.04), leading to the greatest reduction of the scale-invariant correlations in very old people with late-stage AD-resembling closely the loss of correlations at large time scales in SCN-lesioned animals. Thus, aging and AD significantly attenuate the scale invariance of activity fluctuations over multiple time scales. This attenuation may reflect functional changes of the SCN.",

        "Abstract": "In a multiethnic cohort of older people with diabetes (n=1178), we assessed whether ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring improves prediction of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality when added to baseline covariates, including office BP and heart rate (HR). Secondary analyses assessed whether albuminuria may mediate the association of pulse pressure with mortality. The ambulatory arterial stiffness index was calculated as \"1-slope\" from the within-person regression of diastolic-on-systolic ambulatory BP readings. Mean follow-up was 6.6+/-0.4 years. There were 287 deaths; death certificates were available for 215 deaths (75%), and 110 of them were deemed of cardiovascular cause. Cox models were built incrementally. First, models using clinical and laboratory variables selected albuminuria and office HRs as independent predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. When ambulatory monitoring data were added, sleep:wake HR ratio and ambulatory arterial stiffness index added significantly to the prediction of all-cause mortality, but only sleep:wake HR ratio added to the prediction of cardiovascular mortality. Office HR and albuminuria retained significance as predictors of both types of mortality. Secondary analyses without adjustment for albuminuria confirmed the predictive value of office HR and sleep/wake HR, whereas 24-hour pulse pressure and sleep systolic BP were also independently predictive of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. In conclusion, office HR and albuminuria were strong predictors of mortality. Ambulatory monitoring improved the prediction of risk through its assessment of sleep HR dipping and of ambulatory arterial stiffness index, a measure of the dynamic relationship between systolic and diastolic BPs. Albuminuria may mediate the association between BP and mortality.",

Eighty percent of respondents believed that a diabetes telemedicine case management system would help their practice. An overall satisfaction score (possible range 0-80) suggested good acceptability (mean 66, SD 12). In multiple linear regression, the rural location and younger age of the PCPs were independent predictors of higher satisfaction (both P < 0.01). Within-PCP comparisons showed a higher perceived impact on patients, as compared to impact on PCP practices (P < 0.001).

        "Title": "An endogenous circadian rhythm in sleep inertia results in greatest cognitive impairment upon awakening during the biological night.",
        "Abstract": "Sleep inertia is the impaired cognitive performance immediately upon awakening, which decays over tens of minutes. This phenomenon has relevance to people who need to make important decisions soon after awakening, such as on-call emergency workers. Such awakenings can occur at varied times of day or night, so the objective of the study was to determine whether or not the magnitude of sleep inertia varies according to the phase of the endogenous circadian cycle. Twelve adults (mean, 24 years; 7 men) with no medical disorders other than mild asthma were studied. Following 2 baseline days and nights, subjects underwent a forced desynchrony protocol composed of seven 28-h sleep/wake cycles, while maintaining a sleep/wakefulness ratio of 1:2 throughout. Subjects were awakened by a standardized auditory stimulus 3 times each sleep period for sleep inertia assessments. The magnitude of sleep inertia was quantified as the change in cognitive performance (number of correct additions in a 2-min serial addition test) across the first 20 min of wakefulness. Circadian phase was estimated from core body temperature (fitted temperature minimum assigned 0 degrees ). Data were segregated according to: (1) circadian phase (60 degrees bins); (2) sleep stage; and (3) 3rd of the night after which awakenings occurred (i.e., tertiary 1, 2, or 3). To control for any effect of sleep stage, the circadian rhythm of sleep inertia was initially assessed following awakenings from Stage 2 (62% of awakening occurred from this stage; n = 110). This revealed a significant circadian rhythm in the sleep inertia of cognitive performance (p = 0.007), which was 3.6 times larger during the biological night (circadian bin 300 degrees , approximately 2300-0300 h in these subjects) than during the biological day (bin 180 degrees , approximately 1500-1900 h). The circadian rhythm in sleep inertia was still present when awakenings from all sleep stages were included (p = 0.004), and this rhythm could not be explained by changes in underlying sleep drive prior to awakening (changes in sleep efficiency across circadian phase or across the tertiaries), or by the proportion of the varied sleep stages prior to awakenings. This robust endogenous circadian rhythm in sleep inertia may have important implications for people who need to be alert soon after awakening.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of the study was to develop and implement an architecture for remote training that can be used in the narrowband home telemedicine environment. A remote training architecture, the REmote Patient Education in a Telemedicine Environment (REPETE) architecture, using a remote control protocol (RCP) was developed. A set of design criteria was specified. The developed architecture was integrated into the IDEATel home telemedicine unit (HTU) and evaluated against these design criteria using a combination of technical and expert evaluations. Technical evaluation of the architecture demonstrated that remote cursor movements and positioning displayed on the HTU were smooth and effectively real-time. The trainers were able to observe within approximately 2 seconds lag what the patient sees on their HTU screen. Evaluation of the architecture by experts was favorable. Responses to a Likert scale questionnaire regarding audio quality and remote control performance indicated that the expert evaluators thought that the audio quality and remote control performance were adequate for remote training. All evaluators strongly agreed that the system would be useful for training patients. The REPETE architecture supports basic training needs over a narrowband dial-up connection. We were able to maintain an audio chat simultaneously with performing a remote training session, while maintaining both acceptable audio quality and remote control performance. The RCP provides a mechanism to provide training without requiring a trainer to go to the patient's home and effectively supports deictic referencing to on screen objects.",

        "Abstract": "Adverse cardiovascular events in humans occur with a day/night pattern, presumably related to a daily pattern of behaviours or endogenous circadian rhythms in cardiovascular variables. Healthy humans possess a scale-invariant/fractal structure in heartbeat fluctuations that exhibits an endogenous circadian rhythm and changes towards the structure observed in cardiovascular disease at the circadian phase corresponding to the time of the broad peak of adverse cardiovascular events (at about 10 AM). To explore the relationship between the rest/activity cycle, endogenous circadian rhythmicity, and cardiac vulnerability, we tested whether the fractal structure of heart rate exhibits a similar circadian rhythm in a mammalian species that is nocturnally active (Wistar rats) compared with diurnally active humans, and how this fractal structure changes after lesioning the circadian pacemaker (suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN) in rats.",

        "Abstract": "Telemedicine is a promising but largely unproven technology for providing case management services to patients with chronic conditions who experience barriers to access to care or a high burden of illness. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine case management to usual care, with blinding of those obtaining outcome data, in 1,665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged 55 years or greater, and living in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. In New York City, 98% of participants were black or Hispanic, 69% were Medicaid-eligible, and 93% reported annual household income < or =$20,000. In upstate New York, 91% were white, 14% Medicaid eligible, and 50% reported annual household income < or =$20,000. A baseline survey found that 95% of participants in New York City and 67% in upstate New York reported that they did not know how to use a computer. The primary endpoints were HgbA1c, blood pressure, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. In the intervention group (N = 844), mean HgbA1c improved over 1 year from 7.35% to 6.97%, and from 8.35% to 7.42% in the subgroup with baseline HgbA1c > or =7% (N = 353). In the usual care group (N = 821), mean HgbA1c improved over 1 year from 7.42% to 7.17%. Adjusted net reductions (1-year minus baseline mean values in each group, compared between groups) favoring the intervention were as follows: HgbA1c, 0.18% (p = 0.006), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 3.4 (p = 0.001) and 1.9 mmHg (p < 0.001), and LDL cholesterol, 9.5 mg/dl (p < 0.001). In the subgroup with baseline HgbA1c > or =7%, net adjusted reduction in HgbA1c favoring the intervention group was 0.32% (p = 0.002). Mean LDL cholesterol level in the intervention group at one year was 95.7 mg/dl. The intervention effects were similar in magnitude in the subgroups living in New York City and upstate New York. A satisfaction survey of intervention group participants (N = 346 respondents) showed high levels of satisfaction with major intervention components. A satisfaction survey of participating primary care physicians (N = 116 respondents) showed positive perceptions for acceptability, impact on patients and communication. Telemedicine case management improved glycemic control, blood pressure levels, and total and LDL-cholesterol levels at 1 year of follow-up. Telemedicine is an effective method for translating modern approaches to disease management into effective care for underserved populations.",

        "Abstract": "Heartbeat fluctuations in mammals display a robust temporal structure characterized by scale-invariant/fractal patterns. These scale-invariant patterns likely confer physiological advantage because they change with cardiovascular disease and these changes are associated with reduced survival. Models of physical systems imply that to produce scale-invariant patterns, factors influencing the system at different time scales must be coupled via a network of feedback interactions. A similar cardiac control network is hypothesized to be responsible for the scale-invariant pattern in heartbeat dynamics, although the essential network components have not been determined. Here is shown that scale-invariant cardiac control occurs across time scales from minutes to approximately 24 h, and that lesioning the mammalian circadian pacemaker (suprachiasmatic nucleus; SCN) completely abolishes the scale-invariant pattern at time scales>or approximately 4 h. At time scales<or approximately 4 h, the scale invariance persisted following SCN lesion but with a different pattern. These results indicate previously unrecognized multiscale influences of the SCN on heart rate fluctuations that cannot be explained by a simple pacemaker of 24-h rhythmicity. The conclusion is that the SCN serves as a major node in the cardiac control network and imparts scale-invariant cardiac control across a wide range of time scales with strongest effects between approximately 4 and 24 h. These results demonstrate that experimental manipulations (e.g., SCN lesion) can be used to begin to model and understand the origin of scale-invariant behavior in a neurophysiological system.",

        "Abstract": "We assessed whether home blood pressure monitoring improved the prediction of progression of albuminuria when added to office measurements and compared it with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in a multiethnic cohort of older people (n=392) with diabetes mellitus, without macroalbuminuria, participating in the telemedicine arm of the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine Study. Albuminuria was assessed by measuring the spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio at baseline and annually for 3 years. The ambulatory sleep:wake systolic blood pressure ratio was categorized as dipping (ratio: < or =0.9), nondipping (ratio: >0.9 to 1.0), and nocturnal rise (ratio: >1.0). In a repeated-measures mixed linear model, after adjustment that included office pulse pressure, home pulse pressure was independently associated with a higher follow-up albumin:creatinine ratio (P=0.001). That association persisted (P=0.01) after adjusting for 24-hour pulse pressure and nocturnal rise, which were also independent predictors (P=0.02 and P=0.03, respectively). Cox proportional hazards models examined the progression of albuminuria (n=74) as defined by cutoff values used by clinicians. After the adjustment for office pulse pressure, the hazards ratio (95% CI) per 10-mm Hg increment of home pulse pressure was 1.34 (range: 1.1 to 1.7; P=0.01). Home pulse pressure was not an independent predictor in the model including ambulatory monitoring data; a nocturnal rise was the only independent predictor (P=0.035). Cox models built separately for home pulse pressure and ambulatory monitoring exhibited similar calibration and discrimination. In conclusion, nocturnal blood pressure elevation was the strongest predictor of worsening albuminuria. Home blood pressure measurements added to office measurements and may constitute an adequate substitute for ambulatory monitoring.",

        "Abstract": "Few studies have investigated the specific features implicated in neighborhood-health associations. We examined associations between measures of neighborhood problems and neighborhood social cohesion with depression, smoking, drinking, and walking for exercise in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort. Neighborhoods were characterized according to participant self-report and aggregated measures based on other MESA participants. Individuals living in the least problematic neighborhoods were significantly less likely to be depressed, to smoke, or to drink. Less socially cohesive neighborhoods were associated with increased depression, smoking, and not walking for exercise. Results persisted after adjusting for individual-level variables. Each measure appeared to capture distinct features of the neighborhood and associations did not differ by race/ethnicity. Results for neighborhood problems were robust to the use of aggregate measures but results for social cohesion generally were not. Future work should determine the health effect of modifying specific features of the neighborhood context.",

        "Abstract": "Ambulatory 24-hour pulse pressure predicts progression of albuminuria in persons with diabetes mellitus. The authors assessed whether nocturnal blood pressure (BP) patterns added predictive information and examined the multivariate-adjusted association of nocturnal BP patterns with progression of urine albumin excretion during follow-up in a multiethnic cohort of older people (n=957) with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were free of macroalbuminuria. Albuminuria was assessed by spot urine measurement of albumin-to-creatinine ratio at baseline and annually for 3 years. Participants were categorized according to their sleep/wake systolic BP ratio as dippers (ratio </=0.9; n=295), nondippers (flat nocturnal pattern, ratio >0.9 to 1; n=475), and nocturnal BP risers (ratio >1; n=187). The proportion exhibiting progression of albuminuria in dippers, nondippers, and risers was 17.6%, 22.9%, and 27.3%, respectively (P for linear trend = .01). A nocturnal BP rise was independently associated with progression of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-2.60; P=.02), whereas office pulse pressure was not. When ambulatory 24-hour pulse pressure was added to the model, the nocturnal BP rise remained an independent predictor of progression of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.02-2.45; P=.04). Nocturnal nondipping (without BP increase) was not an independent predictor. In conclusion, nocturnal BP rise on ambulatory monitoring is superior to office BP to predict worsening of albuminuria in elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes and adds to the information provided by 24-hour pulse pressure.",

        "Abstract": "Our goal was to identify reasons for enrollment or refusal to participate in a randomized trial of telemedicine case management of diabetes. We performed a prospective survey of participants and non-participants during recruitment for the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) study, a randomized trial of telemedicine case management of diabetes mellitus in medically underserved elderly. There were two recruitment areas: urban New York City, and rural upstate New York. A Participant Questionnaire (PQ) was administered at the baseline IDEATel visit, and a Non-Participant Questionnaire (NPQ) was administered during the recruitment telephone call. Both questionnaires listed possible responses; subjects could choose more than one response or give their own. Of 1,660 IDEATel participants, 99.7% completed the PQ. Most frequent reason for participation was the belief that the technology could help them (52% and 42% of urban and rural respondents, respectively). Of the 2,231 subjects refusing participation, 28% answered the NPQ (90% of respondents were from rural area). Most frequent reasons not to participate in the rural area were being too busy (23%), and discomfort with the technology (22%), and in the urban area the belief that the technology could not help them (71%), discomfort with it (52%), and not liking to participate in studies (52%). In multivariate analysis (rural respondents only), knowing how to use a computer was an independent predictor of participation (p < 0.001). In conclusion, perceptions and beliefs regarding technology, including the expectation to benefit from it, played an important role in the decision to participate.",

        "Abstract": "Business model and financial recovery issues dominate discussions about using telemedicine to improve chronic disease management. The technical issues are numerous, daunting and complex, but many can be addressed using the resources and infrastructure available in large, well-integrated clinical information systems. The cost-benefit balance will change when it becomes possible to use devices that are owned by patients for everyday use, rather than installing special-purpose devices for telemedicine. Technology and communications capabilities are driven mainly by market factors other than uses for health care. Provider-side telemedicine capabilities, specifically for upload, storage and display of home medical data, will improve as technology develops. How health-care providers will process the larger amount of data made available by telemedicine is a clinical issue, but it is likely that software will emerge to assist in this task. The alignment of financial incentives for health-care providers is a decisive factor in understanding why telemedicine has had substantial deployment within the US Veterans Hospital Administration system, and to some extent within prison health systems and the Kaiser Permanente Health Plan, but much less widely in other settings.",

        "Title": "Ambulatory pulse pressure and progression of urinary albumin excretion in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
        "Abstract": "We studied whether ambulatory blood pressure monitoring added to office blood pressure in predicting progression of urine albumin excretion over 2 years of follow-up in a multiethnic cohort of older people with type-2 diabetes mellitus. Participants in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine study underwent a baseline evaluation that included office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement and a spot urine measurement of albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Measurements of albumin-to-creatinine ratio were repeated 1 and 2 years later. In bivariate analyses, ambulatory 24-hour pulse pressure was the blood pressure variable most strongly associated with follow-up ACR. Repeated-measures mixed linear models (n = 1040) were built adjusting for baseline ACR ratio, clustered randomization, time to follow-up, and multiple covariates. When both were entered into the model, ambulatory 24-hour pulse pressure and office pulse pressure were independently associated with follow-up ACR (beta [SE] = 0.010 [0.002], P < 0.001, and 0.004 [0.001], P = 0.002, respectively). Cox proportional hazards models examined associations with progression of albuminuria in 954 participants without macroalbuminuria at baseline, adjusting for all of the covariates independently associated with follow-up ACR in mixed linear models. Ambulatory 24-hour pulse pressure, but not office pulse pressure, was independently associated with progression of albuminuria (P = 0.015 and 0.052, respectively). The adjusted hazards ratio (95% CI) per each 10-mm Hg increment in ambulatory pulse pressure was 1.23 (1.04 to 1.42). In conclusion, ambulatory pulse pressure may provide additional information to predict progression of albuminuria in elderly diabetic subjects above and beyond office blood pressure.",

        "Abstract": "Plasma sphingomyelin has been shown to be an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, but the relation of plasma sphingomyelin to earlier, subclinical atherosclerotic disease has not been reported. The authors examined the association between plasma sphingomyelin and three measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease (carotid intimal-medial wall thickness, ankle-arm blood pressure index, and Agatston coronary artery calcium score) among 6,814 middle-aged, asymptomatic adults in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, which was initiated in 2000. The sphingomyelin level was positively correlated with lipids and the Framingham risk score (p < 0.01 for both), and the mean level was higher in women than men (50 (standard deviation (SD), 16) vs. 45 (SD, 15) mg/dl) (p < 0.01) and higher in never versus current smokers (49 (SD, 16) vs. 45 (SD, 17) mg/dl) (p < 0.01). Women with sphingomyelin levels of 60 or more mg/dl had more severe subclinical disease by all three measures than did the referent group with sphingomyelin levels of 39 or less mg/dl, although associations were not significant after multivariate adjustment for standard cardiovascular disease risk factors. Men with sphingomyelin levels of 60 or more mg/dl versus those with sphingomyelin levels of 39 or less mg/dl had higher calcium scores (135 vs. 99 Agatston units) (p = 0.01). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that plasma sphingomyelin is in the biologic pathway that mediates the risk for subclinical disease attributable to standard cardiovascular disease risk factors.",

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring seems to be superior to office blood pressure in predicting progression to microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes. The associations of ambulatory blood pressure with office blood pressure and microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes remain unclear. We studied the association of office blood pressure taken with an automated device and ambulatory blood pressure with spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio in 1180 older people with type 2 diabetes participating in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine Study. Office and awake systolic blood pressure were independently associated with albuminuria (P<0.001 for both) in a multivariate linear regression analysis that adjusted for age, gender, duration of diabetes, hemoglobin A1c, number of antihypertensive medications, and use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Twelve percent of participants had well-controlled office blood pressure but not ambulatory blood pressure, whereas 14% had well-controlled ambulatory but not office blood pressure. The prevalence of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria in these subgroups was intermediate between those with well-controlled or uncontrolled blood pressure by both methods. We found, in a multiethnic group of older subjects with type 2 diabetes, that office systolic blood pressure and awake systolic ambulatory blood pressure exhibited independent associations with degree of albuminuria.",

        "Abstract": "We examined the effect of APOC1-317insCGTT allele status (HpaI RFLP, deletion [H1] and insertion [H2] alleles) on serum apolipoprotein (apo) C-I level in 362 Hispanic children in the Columbia University BioMarkers Study. The H2 allele was present in 147 subjects (40.6%). Serum apoC-I was 20% lower in the presence of the H2 allele in APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 homozygotes (P=0.003) but did not differ by H2 status in epsilon4 carriers. Insufficient numbers of epsilon2 carriers (N=45) were present for analysis. In multivariate analysis in the epsilon3/epsilon3 context, after adjusting for potential covariate effects and familial aggregation, the mean effect of H2/* versus H1/H1 on apoC-I level, was estimated to be 2.15+/-0.55mg/dl (P<0.0025). Plasma triglyceride level was weakly correlated with serum apoC-I level (Pearson's r=0.17, P<0.001) but was highly correlated with serum apoC-III (Pearson's r=0.74, P<0.0001). Nevertheless, presence of the H2 allele was not significantly associated with serum apoC-III level. Thus, the effect of APOC1 genotype on serum apoC-I level was not due to apoC-I level serving as a surrogate for triglyceride level. The APOC1-317insCGTT allele is a commonly polymorphic genetic marker that is associated with serum apoC-I level in the APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 context. These findings suggest that the mechanism of the previously described association with plasma TG is, at least in part, related to the correlation of the polymorphism with the level of expression of apoC-I.",

        "Abstract": "We investigate if known extrinsic and intrinsic factors fully account for the complex features observed in recordings of human activity as measured from forearm motion in subjects undergoing their regular daily routine. We demonstrate that the apparently random forearm motion possesses dynamic patterns characterized by robust scale-invariant and nonlinear features. These patterns remain stable from one subject to another and are unaffected by changes in the average activity level that occur within individual subjects throughout the day and on different days of the week, since they persist during daily routine and when the same subjects undergo time-isolation laboratory experiments designed to account for the circadian phase and to control the known extrinsic factors. Further, by modeling the scheduled events imposed throughout the laboratory protocols, we demonstrate that they cannot account for the observed scaling patterns in activity fluctuations. We attribute these patterns to a previously unrecognized intrinsic nonlinear multi-scale control mechanism of human activity that is independent of known extrinsic factors such as random and scheduled events, as well as the known intrinsic factors which possess a single characteristic time scale such as circadian and ultradian rhythms.",

        "Abstract": "Leptin and adiponectin play important physiological roles in regulating appetite, food intake, and energy balance and have pathophysiological roles in obesity and anorexia nervosa. To assess the relative contributions of day/night patterns in behaviors (sleep/wake cycle and food intake) and of the endogenous circadian pacemaker on observed day/night patterns of adipokines, in six healthy subjects we measured circulating leptin, soluble leptin receptor, adiponectin, glucose, and insulin levels throughout a constant routine protocol (38 h of wakefulness with constant posture, temperature, and dim light, as well as identical snacks every 2 h) and throughout sleep and fasting periods before and after the constant routine. There were significant endogenous circadian rhythms in leptin, glucose, and insulin, with peaks around the usual time of awakening. Sleep/fasting resulted in additional systematic decreases in leptin, glucose, and insulin, whereas wakefulness/food intake resulted in a systematic increase in leptin. Thus, the day/night pattern in leptin is likely caused by combined effects from the endogenous circadian pacemaker and day/night patterns in behaviors. Our data imply that alterations in the sleep/wake schedule would lead to an increased daily range in circulating leptin, with lowest leptin upon awakening, which, by influencing food intake and energy balance, could be implicated in the increased prevalence of obesity in the shift work population.",

        "Abstract": "There exists a robust day/night pattern in the incidence of adverse cardiac events with a peak at approximately 10 a.m. This peak traditionally has been attributed to day/night patterns in behaviors affecting cardiac function in vulnerable individuals. However, influences from the endogenous circadian pacemaker independent from behaviors may also affect cardiac control. Heartbeat dynamics under healthy conditions exhibit robust complex fluctuations characterized by self-similar temporal structures, which break down under pathologic conditions. We hypothesize that these dynamical features of the healthy human heartbeat have an endogenous circadian rhythm that brings the features closer to those observed under pathologic conditions at the endogenous circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m. We investigate heartbeat dynamics in healthy subjects recorded throughout a 10-day protocol wherein the sleep/wake and behavior cycles are desynchronized from the endogenous circadian cycle, enabling assessment of circadian factors while controlling for behavior-related factors. We demonstrate that the scaling exponent characterizing temporal correlations in heartbeat dynamics does exhibit a significant circadian rhythm (with a sharp peak at the circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m.), which is independent from scheduled behaviors and mean heart rate. Cardiac dynamics under pathologic conditions such as congestive heart failure also are associated with a larger value of the scaling exponent of the interbeat interval. Thus, the sharp peak in the scaling exponent at the circadian phase coinciding with the period of highest cardiac vulnerability observed in epidemiological studies suggests that endogenous circadian-mediated influences on cardiac control may be involved in the day/night pattern of adverse cardiac events in vulnerable individuals.",

        "Abstract": "Telemedicine has the potential to transcend geographic and socio-cultural barriers to the delivery of high quality health care to the medically underserved populations. However, there are significant cognitive and usability barriers. This paper presents a multifaceted cognitive evaluation of the IDEATel diabetes education and telemedicine program. The evaluation included a cognitive walkthrough analysis to characterize task complexity and identify potential problems as well as field usability testing in patients' homes. The study revealed dimensions of the interface that impeded optimal access to system resources. In addition, we found significant obstacles corresponding to perceptual-motoric skills, mental models of the system, and health literacy. The objective of this work is to contribute to a design framework so that participants with a wide range of skills can better manage their chronic illnesses.",
