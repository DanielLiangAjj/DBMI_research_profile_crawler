        "Abstract": "The microbiome is an emerging key co-factor in the development of esophageal cancer, the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. However, there is a paucity of data delineating how the microbiome contributes to the pathobiology of the two histological subtypes of esophageal cancer: esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma. This critical knowledge gap is partially due to inadequate modeling of host-microbiome interactions in the etiology of esophageal cancers. Recent advances have enabled progress in this field. Three dimensional (3D) organoids faithfully recapitulate the structure and function of the normal, preneoplastic, and neoplastic epithelia of the esophagus ex vivo and serve as a platform translatable for applications in precision medicine. Elsewhere in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the co-culture of 3D organoids with the bacterial microbiome has fostered insight into the pathogenic role of the microbiome in other GI cancers. Herein, we will summarize our current understanding of the relationship between the microbiome and esophageal cancer, discuss 3D organoid models of esophageal homeostasis, review analogous models of host-microbiome interactions in other GI cancers, and advocate for the application of these models to esophageal cancers. Together, we present a promising, novel approach with the potential to ameliorate the burden of esophageal cancer-related morbidity and mortality via improved prevention and therapeutic interventions.",

The rapidly regenerating intestinal epithelium harbors diverse cell types and their lineage relationships have been studied using numerous approaches, from classical label-retaining and genetic lineage tracing methods to novel transcriptome-based annotations. Here, we describe the developmental trajectories that dictate differentiation and lineage specification in the intestinal epithelium. We focus on the most recent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)-based strategies for understanding intestinal epithelial cell lineage relationships, underscoring how they have refined our view of the development of this tissue and highlighting their advantages and limitations. We emphasize how these technologies have been applied to understand the dynamics of intestinal epithelial cells in homeostatic and injury-induced regeneration models.",

Many new putative markers of intestinal stem cells and their progeny have been described using single-cell transcriptomics, which has contributed to the identification of novel subpopulations of mature cell types and insight into their developmental trajectories. This approach has revealed tremendous cellular heterogeneity within the intestinal epithelium that is concordant with its diverse and multifaceted functions.

        "Abstract": "Emerging single-cell technologies, like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), enable the study of heterogeneous biological systems at cellular resolution. By profiling the set of expressed transcripts in each cell, single-cell transcriptomics has allowed for the cataloging of the cellular constituents of multiple organs and tissues, both in health and disease. In addition, these technologies have provided mechanistic insights into cellular function, cell state transitions, developmental trajectories and lineage relationships, as well as helped to dissect complex, population-level responses to environmental perturbations. scRNA-seq is particularly useful for characterizing the intestinal epithelium because it is a dynamic, rapidly self-renewing tissue comprised of more than a dozen specialized cell types. Here we discuss the fundamentals of single-cell transcriptomics of the murine small intestinal epithelium. We review the principles of proper experimental design and provide methods for the dissociation of the small intestinal epithelium into single cells followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and for scRNA-seq using the 10× Genomics Chromium platform.",

        "Abstract": "The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway governs diverse developmental, homeostatic and pathological processes. Palmitoylated Wnt ligands engage cell-surface frizzled (FZD) receptors and LRP5 and LRP6 co-receptors, enabling β-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF/LEF-dependent gene transactivation. Mutations in Wnt downstream signalling components have revealed diverse functions thought to be carried out by Wnt ligands themselves. However, redundancy between the 19 mammalian Wnt proteins and 10 FZD receptors and Wnt hydrophobicity have made it difficult to attribute these functions directly to Wnt ligands. For example, individual mutations in Wnt ligands have not revealed homeostatic phenotypes in the intestinal epithelium-an archetypal canonical, Wnt pathway-dependent, rapidly self-renewing tissue, the regeneration of which is fueled by proliferative crypt Lgr5",

        "Abstract": "Wnt signalling is involved in multiple aspects of embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, notably via controlling cellular proliferation and differentiation. Wnt signalling is subject to stringent positive and negative regulation to promote proper development and homeostasis yet avoid aberrant growth. Such multi-layer regulation includes post-translational modification and processing of Wnt proteins themselves, R-spondin (Rspo) amplification of Wnt signalling, diverse receptor families, and intracellular and extracellular antagonists and destruction and transcription complexes. In the gastrointestinal tract, Wnt signalling is crucial for development and renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) undergo symmetric division and neutral drift dynamics to renew the intestinal epithelium. Sources of Wnts and Wnt amplifers such as R-spondins are beginning to be elucidated as well as their functional contribution to intestinal homeostasis. In this review we focus on regulation of ISCs and intestinal homeostasis by the Wnt/Rspo pathway, the potential cellular sources of Wnt signalling regulators and highlight potential future areas of study.",

        "Title": "Engineering of three-dimensional microenvironments to promote contractile behavior in primary intestinal organoids.",
        "Abstract": "Multiple culture techniques now exist for the long-term maintenance of neonatal primary murine intestinal organoids in vitro; however, the achievement of contractile behavior within cultured organoids has thus far been infrequent and unpredictable. Here we combine finite element simulation of oxygen transport and quantitative comparative analysis of cellular microenvironments to elucidate the critical variables that promote reproducible intestinal organoid contraction. Experimentally, oxygen distribution was manipulated by adjusting the ambient oxygen concentration along with the use of semi-permeable membranes to enhance transport. The culture microenvironment was further tailored through variation of collagen type-I matrix density, addition of exogenous R-spondin1, and specification of culture geometry. \"Air-liquid interface\" cultures resulted in significantly higher numbers of contractile cultures relative to traditional submerged cultures. These interface cultures were confirmed to have enhanced and more symmetric oxygen transport relative to traditional submerged cultures. While oxygen availability was found to impact in vitro contraction rate and the orientation of contractile movement, it was not a key factor in enabling contractility. For all conditions tested, reproducible contractile behavior only occurred within a consistent and narrow range of collagen type-I matrix densities with porosities of approximately 20% and storage moduli near 30 Pa. This suggests that matrix density acts as a \"permissive switch\" that enables contractions to occur. Similarly, contractions were only observed in cultures with diameters less than 15.5 mm that had relatively large interfacial surface area between the compliant matrix and the rigid culture dish. Taken together, these data suggest that spatial geometry and mechanics of the microenvironment, which includes both the encapsulating matrix as well as the surrounding culture device, may be key determinants of intestinal organoid functionality. As peristaltic contractility is a crucial requirement for normal digestive tract function, this achievement of reproducible organoid contraction marks a pivotal advancement towards engineering physiologically functional replacement tissue constructs.",

        "Abstract": "The small intestine epithelium undergoes rapid and continuous regeneration supported by crypt intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Bmi1 and Lgr5 have been independently identified to mark long-lived multipotent ISCs by lineage tracing in mice; however, the functional distinctions between these two populations remain undefined. Here, we demonstrate that Bmi1 and Lgr5 mark two functionally distinct ISCs in vivo. Lgr5 marks mitotically active ISCs that exhibit exquisite sensitivity to canonical Wnt modulation, contribute robustly to homeostatic regeneration, and are quantitatively ablated by irradiation. In contrast, Bmi1 marks quiescent ISCs that are insensitive to Wnt perturbations, contribute weakly to homeostatic regeneration, and are resistant to high-dose radiation injury. After irradiation, however, the normally quiescent Bmi1(+) ISCs dramatically proliferate to clonally repopulate multiple contiguous crypts and villi. Clonogenic culture of isolated single Bmi1(+) ISCs yields long-lived self-renewing spheroids of intestinal epithelium that produce Lgr5-expressing cells, thereby establishing a lineage relationship between these two populations in vitro. Taken together, these data provide direct evidence that Bmi1 marks quiescent, injury-inducible reserve ISCs that exhibit striking functional distinctions from Lgr5(+) ISCs and support a model whereby distinct ISC populations facilitate homeostatic vs. injury-induced regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "The discovery of RNA-mediated gene-silencing pathways, including RNA interference, highlights a fundamental role of short RNAs in eukaryotic gene regulation and antiviral defence. Members of the Dicer and Argonaute protein families are essential components of these RNA-silencing pathways. Notably, these two families possess an evolutionarily conserved PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille) domain whose biochemical function is unknown. Here we report the nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the PAZ domain from Drosophila melanogaster Argonaute 1 (Ago1). The structure consists of a left-handed, six-stranded beta-barrel capped at one end by two alpha-helices and wrapped on one side by a distinctive appendage, which comprises a long beta-hairpin and a short alpha-helix. Using structural and biochemical analyses, we demonstrate that the PAZ domain binds a 5-nucleotide RNA with 1:1 stoichiometry. We map the RNA-binding surface to the open face of the beta-barrel, which contains amino acids conserved within the PAZ domain family, and we define the 5'-to-3' orientation of single-stranded RNA bound within that site. Furthermore, we show that PAZ domains from different human Argonaute proteins also bind RNA, establishing a conserved function for this domain.",

We report here the solution structure of the PTB domain of the signaling protein Shc in the free form. Comparison of this structure with that of the complex form, obtained previously with a phosphopeptide ligand, reveals that the Shc PTB domain is structurally disordered in the free form, particularly around the regions constituting the peptide binding pocket. The binding of the ligand appears to reorganize this pocket through local folding events triggering a conformational switch between the free and the complex forms.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains are structurally conserved modules found in proteins involved in numerous biological processes including signaling through cell-surface receptors and protein trafficking. While their original discovery is attributed to the recognition of phosphotyrosine in the context of NPXpY sequences -- a function distinct from that of the classical src homology 2 (SH2) domain -- recent studies show that these protein modules have much broader ligand binding specificities. These studies highlight the functional diversity of the PTB domain family as generalized protein interaction domains, and reinforce the concept that evolutionary changes of structural elements around the ligand binding site on a conserved structural core may endow these protein modules with the structural plasticity necessary for functional versatility.",

        "Title": "FRS2 PTB domain conformation regulates interactions with divergent neurotrophic receptors.",
        "Abstract": "Membrane-anchored adaptor proteins FRS2alpha/beta (also known as SNT-1/2) mediate signaling of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) and neurotrophin receptors (TRKs) through their N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. The FRS2 PTB domain recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated TRKs at an NPXpY (where pY is phosphotyrosine) motif, whereas its constitutive association with FGFR involves a receptor juxtamembrane region lacking Tyr and Asn residues. Here we show by isothermal titration calorimetry that the FRS2alpha PTB domain binding to peptides derived from TRKs or FGFR is thermodynamically different. TRK binding is largely enthalpy-driven, whereas the FGFR interaction is governed by a favorable entropic contribution to the free energy of binding. Furthermore, our NMR spectral analysis suggests that disruption of an unstructured region C-terminal to the PTB domain alters local conformation and dynamics of the residues at the ligand-binding site, and that structural disruption of the beta8-strand directly weakens the PTB domain association with the FGFR ligand. Together, our new findings support a molecular mechanism by which conformational dynamics of the FRS2alpha PTB domain dictates its association with either fibroblast growth factor or neurotrophin receptors in neuronal development.",
