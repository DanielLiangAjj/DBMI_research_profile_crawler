        "Title": "EMP3: A promising biomarker for tumor prognosis and targeted cancer therapy.",
        "Abstract": "Epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3) belongs to the peripheral myelin protein 22 kDa (PMP22) gene family, characterized by four transmembrane domains and widespread expression across various human tissues and organs. Other members of the PMP22 family, including EMP1, EMP2, and PMP22, have been linked to various cancers, such as glioblastoma, laryngeal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer. However, few studies report on the function and relevance of EMP3 in tumorigenicity. Given the significant structural similarities among members of the PMP22 family, there are likely potential functional similarities as well. Previous studies have established the regulatory role of EMP3 in immune cells like T cells and macrophages. Additionally, EMP3 is found to be involved in critical signaling pathways, including HER-2/PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and TGF-beta/Smad. Furthermore, EMP3 is associated with cell cycle regulation, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. Hence, it is likely that EMP3 participates in cancer development through these aforementioned pathways and mechanisms. This review aims to systematically examine and summarize the structure and function of EMP3 and its association to various cancers. EMP3 is expected to emerge as a significant biological marker for tumor prognosis and a potential target in cancer therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) perceive calcium signals triggered by abiotic stress and interact with CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) to form a complex signal network. This study identified 21 SsCBL and 89 SsCIPK genes in Saccharum spontaneum, and 90 ScCBL and 367 ScCIPK genes in the sugarcane cultivar ZZ1. Phylogenetic analysis classified CBL genes into three groups and CIPK genes into twenty-five groups, with whole-genome duplication events promoting their expansion in sugarcane. RNA-seq analysis revealed their involvement in abiotic stress responses through ABA, JA, and SA pathways. Four ScCBLs and eight ScCIPKs were cloned from ZZ1. Three CBL-CIPK interactions were detected using a yeast two-hybrid system and Firefly luciferase complementation imaging, showing CBLs as membrane proteins and CIPKs as nuclear proteins. Spatial expression profiles indicate these genes are expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in roots. Gene expression analyses suggested that CBL-CIPK signaling networks are involved in responses to drought, salt, and reactive oxygen species, possibly through Ca",

        "Abstract": "Addressing the conflict between achieving elevated mechanical stretchability and environmental adaptability is significant to a breakthrough in the practical application of flexible wearable materials. Therefore, inspired by the perceptive and protective properties of human skin, flexible wearable electronic skins (E-skins) based on deep eutectic solvent (DES) liquid and multiresponse eutectogel have been widely considered to be a promising platform for building a flexible wearable management system to achieve the purpose of \"one stone, two birds\". In this work, a multifunctional E-skin was designed based on an ultrastretchable, transparent, self-adhesive, and environmentally tolerant eutectogel by first incorporating cationized modified chitin nanocrystals into a covalently cross-linked polymer network comprised of the skeleton formed by a PAA polymerization network structure serving as a stretchable matrix and filled with DESs (ChCl:EG). The obtained eutectogel exhibits superhigh stretchability (up to 6707%), high toughness (17.7 MJ/m",

        "Abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterized by the rapid loss of the renal function and has high morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet there is no satisfactory means of prevention and treatment at present. Dioscin, a natural steroidal saponin, has been found to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. In this experiment, we pretreated cisplatin-induced AKI rats with dioscin and found that dioscin significantly enhanced renal function and reduced renal pathological injury in AKI rats. We also found that dioscin improved renal antioxidant capacity by suppressing the accumulation of oxides such as ROS, MDA and H",

        "Abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating neurological and pathological condition that results in significant impairments in motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. By integrating multispectral imaging (MSI) with Raman spectroscopy, a label-free optical methodology was developed for achieving a non-invasive in vivo understanding on the pathological features of SCI evolution. Under the guidance of captured the spectral imaging data cube with a rigid endoscope based MSI system, a special designed fiber probe passed through the instrumental channel for acquiring the finger-print spectral information from compression rat SCI models. After identifying the main visual features of injured spinal cord tissue in all Sham, 0-, 3- and 7-days post injury (0 DPI, 3 DPI, and 7 DPI) groups, the blood volume and oxygen content were visualized to describe hemorrhage, hypoxia and inflammatory state after acute injury. The averaged reflectance spectra, which were deduced from MSI data cubes, were utilized for describing oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration in living tissue. The results of Raman spectroscopy addressed complex compositional and conformational phenomena during SCI progression, correlated with the well-known event like neuronal apoptosis, hemorrhage, demyelination, and even the upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). A principal component analysis and linear discriminate algorithm (PCA-LDA) based discriminate model was introduced for categorizing spectral features in different injury stages, which was applicable for intraoperative interpretations on the complex pathological courses of SCI and therapeutic outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "The manufacturability assessment and optimization of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) during the discovery stage are crucial for the success of the drug development process, impacting the speed and cost of advancing such therapeutics to the Investigational New Drug (IND) stage and ultimately to the market. The complexity of bsAbs creates challenges in employing effective evaluation methods to detect developability risks in early discovery stage, and poses difficulties in identifying the root causes and implementing subsequent engineering solutions. This study presents a case of engineering a bsAb that displayed a normal solution appearance during the discovery phase but underwent significant precipitation when subjected to agitation stress during 15 L Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) production Leveraging analytical tools, structural analysis, ",

        "Abstract": "A series of membrane materials suitable for high-temperature proton exchange membranes (HT-PEM) were successfully prepared by introducing polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) containing quaternary ammonium groups into ether-bonded polybenzimidazole (OPBI). The structure of the cross-linked membrane has a strong interaction with phosphoric acid (PA), which enhances proton transport and PA retention. To ensure better overall performance of the cross-linked membrane, the optimal PIL content is 30 wt% (OPBI-PIL-30 %).

        "Abstract": "Long-range allosteric communication between distant sites and active sites in proteins is central to biological regulation but still poorly characterized, limiting the development of protein engineering and drug design. Addressing this gap, NRIMD is an open-access web server for analyzing long-range interactions in proteins from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, such as the effect of mutations at distal sites or allosteric ligand binding at allosteric sites on the active center. Based on our recent works on neural relational inference using graph neural networks, this cloud-based web server accepts MD simulation data on any length of residues in the alpha-carbon skeleton format from mainstream MD software. The input trajectory data are validated at the frontend deployed on the cloud and then processed on the backend deployed on a high-performance computer system with a collection of complementary tools. The web server provides a one-stop-shop MD analysis platform to predict long-range interactions and their paths between distant sites and active sites. It provides a user-friendly interface for detailed analysis and visualization. To the best of our knowledge, NRIMD is the first-of-its-kind online service to provide comprehensive long-range interaction analysis on MD simulations, which significantly lowers the barrier of predictions on protein long-range interactions using deep learning. The NRIMD web server is publicly available at https://nrimd.luddy.indianapolis.iu.edu/.",

        "Abstract": "In response to the issue of harvesting machine failures affecting crop harvesting timing, this study develops an emergency scheduling model and proposes a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm and an ant colony algorithm. By enhancing the genetic algorithm's crossover and mutation methods and incorporating the ant colony algorithm, the proposed algorithm can prevent local optima, thus minimizing disruptions to the overall scheduling plan. Field data from Deyang, Sichuan Province, were utilized, and simulations on various harvesting machines experiencing random faults were conducted. Results indicated that the improved genetic algorithm reduced the optimal comprehensive scheduling cost during random fault occurrences by 47.49%, 19.60%, and 32.45% compared to the basic genetic algorithm and by 34.70%, 14.80%, and 24.40% compared to the ant colony algorithm. The improved algorithm showcases robust global optimization capabilities, high stability, and rapid convergence, offering effective emergency scheduling solutions in case of harvesting machine failures. Furthermore, a visual management system for agricultural machinery scheduling was developed to provide software support for optimizing agricultural machinery scheduling.",

        "Title": "Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase (DGAT) isoforms play a role in peridroplet mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism in bovine liver.",
        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular lipid accumulation characterizes fatty liver in dairy cows. Lipid droplets (LD), specialized organelles that store lipids and maintain cellular lipid homeostasis, are responsible for the ectopic storage of lipids associated with several metabolic disorders. In recent years, non-ruminant studies have reported that LD-mitochondria interactions play an important role in lipid metabolism. Due to the role of diacylglycerol acyltransferase isoforms (DGAT1 and DGAT2) in LD synthesis, we explored mechanisms of mitochondrial fatty acid transport in ketotic cows using liver biopsies and isolated primary hepatocytes. Compared with healthy cows, cows with fatty liver had massive accumulation of LD and high protein expression of the triglyceride (TAG) synthesis-related enzymes DGAT1 and DGAT2, LD synthesis-related proteins perilipin 2 (PLIN2) and perilipin 5 (PLIN5), and the mitochondrial fragmentation-related proteins dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and fission 1 (FIS1). In contrast, factors associated with fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial electron transport chain complex were lower compared with those in the healthy cows. In addition, transmission electron microscopy revealed significant contacts between LD-mitochondria in liver tissue from cows with fatty liver. Compared with isolated cytoplasmic mitochondria, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A) and DRP1 was lower, but mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and mitochondrial electron transport chain complex was greater in isolated peridroplet mitochondria from hepatic tissue of cows with fatty liver. In vitro data indicated that exogenous free fatty acids (FFA) induced hepatocyte LD synthesis and mitochondrial dynamics consistent with in vivo results. Furthermore, DGAT2 inhibitor treatment attenuated the FFA-induced upregulation of PLIN2 and PLIN5 and rescued the impairment of mitochondrial dynamics. Inhibition of DGAT2 also restored mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced hepatocyte reactive oxygen species production. The present in vivo and in vitro results indicated there are functional differences among different types of mitochondria in the liver tissue of dairy cows with ketosis. Activity of DGAT2 may play a key role in maintaining liver mitochondrial function and lipid homeostasis in dairy cows during the transition period.",

However, CMs for transoral surgery face several issues: large size, which reduces practicality; intersegment coupling, which causes undesired deflection; and a lack of versatility that limits their applicability across different patient groups.",

        "Abstract": "The Exiguobacterium genus comprises Gram-stain-positive and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. Some Exiguobacterium species have previously shown significant high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with each other. This study evaluates the taxonomic classification of those Exiguobacterium species through comprehensive genome analysis. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were determined for various Exiguobacterium species pairs. The ANI and dDDH values between Exiguobacterium enclense and Exiguobacterium indicum, Exiguobacterium aquaticum and Exiguobacterium mexicanum, Exiguobacterium soli and Exiguobacterium antarcticum, and Exiguobacterium sibiricum and Exiguobacterium artemiae were above the cut-off level (95-96% for ANI and 70% for dDDH) for species delineation. Based on the findings, we propose to reclassify Exiguobacterium enclense as a later heterotypic synonym of Exiguobacterium indicum, Exiguobacterium aquaticum as a later heterotypic synonym of Exiguobacterium mexicanum, Exiguobacterium soli as a later heterotypic synonym of Exiguobacterium antarcticum and Exiguobacterium sibiricum as a later heterotypic synonym of Exiguobacterium artemiae.",

        "Title": "Cortactin controls bone homeostasis through regulating the differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.",
        "Abstract": "Cortactin (CTTN), a cytoskeletal protein and substrate of Src kinase, is implicated in tumor aggressiveness. However, its role in bone cell differentiation remains unknown. The current study revealed that CTTN was upregulated during osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation. Functional experiments demonstrated that CTTN promoted the in vitro differentiation of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Mechanistically, CTTN was able to stabilize the protein level of mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR), leading to the activation of mTOR signaling. In-depth investigation revealed that CTTN could bind with casitas B lineage lymphoma-c (c-CBL) and counteract the function of c-CBL, a known E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the proteasomal degradation of mTOR. Silencing c-Cbl alleviated the impaired differentiation of osteoblasts and adipocytes caused by CTTN siRNA, while silencing mTOR mitigated the stimulation of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation induced by CTTN overexpression. Notably, transplantation of CTTN-silenced bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) into the marrow of mice led to a reduction in trabecular bone mass, accompanied by a decrease in osteoblasts and an increase in osteoclasts. Furthermore, CTTN-silenced BMSCs expressed higher levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) than control BMSCs did and promoted osteoclast differentiation when cocultured with bone marrow-derived osteoclast precursor cells. This study provides evidence that CTTN favors osteoblast differentiation by counteracting the c-CBL-induced degradation of mTOR and inhibits osteoclast differentiation by downregulating the expression of RANKL. It also suggests that maintaining an appropriate level of CTTN expression may be advantageous for maintaining bone homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "The molecular generation task stands as a pivotal step in the domains of computational chemistry and drug discovery, aiming to computationally generate molecular structures for specific properties. In contrast to previous models that focused primarily on SMILES strings or molecular graphs, our model placed a special emphasis on the substructure information on molecules, enabling the model to learn richer chemical rules and structure features from fragments and chemical reaction information on molecules. To accomplish this, we fragmented the molecules to construct heterogeneous graph representations based on atom and fragment information. Then our model mapped the heterogeneous graph data into a latent vector space by using an encoder and employed a self-regressive generative model as a decoder for molecular generation. Additionally, we performed transfer learning on the model using a small set of ligand molecules known to be active against the target protein to generate molecules that bind better to the target protein. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is highly competitive with state-of-the-art models. It can generate valid and diverse molecules with favorable physicochemical properties and drug-likeness. Importantly, they produce novel molecules with high docking scores against the target proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancies worldwide, and its high morbidity and mortality have brought a heavy burden to the global public health system. Due to the concealment of its onset, the limitation of treatment, the acquisition of multi-drug resistance and radiation resistance, the treatment of HCC cannot achieve satisfactory results. Epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) is a key process that induces progression, distant metastasis, and therapeutic resistance to a variety of malignant tumors, including HCC. Therefore, targeting EMT has become a promising tumor immunotherapy method for HCC. The NF-κB pathway is a key regulatory pathway for EMT. Targeting this pathway has shown potential to inhibit HCC infiltration, invasion, distant metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. At present, there are still some controversies about this pathway and new ideas of combined therapy, which need to be further explored. This article reviews the progress of immunotherapy in improving EMT development in HCC cells by exploring the mechanism of regulating EMT.",

        "Abstract": "Stretchable ionogels, as soft ion-conducting materials, have generated significant interest. However, the integration of multiple functions into a single ionogel, including temperature tolerance, self-adhesiveness, and stability in diverse environments, remains a challenge. In this study, a new class of fluorine-containing ionogels was synthesized through photo-initiated copolymerization of fluorinated hexafluorobutyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate in a fluorinated ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide. The resulting ionogels demonstrate good stretchability with a fracture strain of ~1300%. Owing to the advantages of the fluorinated network and the ionic liquid, the ionogels show excellent stability in air and vacuum, as well as in various solvent media such as water, sodium chloride solution, and hexane. Additionally, the ionogels display impressive wide temperature tolerance, functioning effectively within a wide temperature range from -60 to 350 °C. Moreover, due to their adhesive properties, the ionogels can be easily attached to various substrates, including plastic, rubber, steel, and glass. Sensors made of these ionogels reliably respond to repetitive tensile-release motion and finger bending in both air and underwater. These findings suggest that the developed ionogels hold great promise for application in wearable devices.",

        "Abstract": "There are complex and diverse substances in traditional vinegars, some of which have been identified as biologically active factors, but the variety of functional compounds is currently restricted. In this study, it was aimed to determine the bioactive compounds in 10 typical functional vinegars. The findings shown that total flavonoids (0.21-7.19 mg rutin equivalent/mL), total phenolics (0.36-3.20 mg gallic acid equivalent/mL), and antioxidant activities (DPPH: 3.17-47.63 mmol trolox equivalent/L, ABTS: 6.85-178.29 mmol trolox equivalent/L) varied among different functional vinegars. In addition, the concentrations of the polysaccharides (1.17-44.87 mg glucose equivalent/mL) and total saponins (0.67-12.46 mg oleanic acid equivalent/mL) were determined, which might play key role for the function of tested vinegars. A total of 8 organic acids, 7 polyphenol compounds and 124 volatile compounds were measured and tentatively identified. The protocatechuic acid (4.81-485.72 mg/L), chlorogenic acid (2.69-7.52 mg/L), and epicatechin (1.18-97.42 mg/L) were important polyphenol compounds in the functional vinegars. Redundancy analysis indicated that tartaric acid, oxalic acid and chlorogenic acid were significantly positively correlated with antioxidant capacity. Various physiologically active ingredients including cyclo (Pro-Leu), cyclo (Phe-Pro), cyclo (Phe-Val), cyclo (Pro-Val), 1-monopalmitin and 1-eicosanol were firstly detected in functional vinegars. Principle component analysis revealed that volatiles profile of bergamot Monascus aromatic vinegar and Hengshun honey vinegar exhibited distinctive differences from other eight vinegar samples. Moreover, the partial least squares regression analysis demonstrated that 11 volatile compounds were positively correlated with the antioxidant activity of vinegars, which suggested these compounds might be important functional substances in tested vinegars. This study explored several new functionally active compounds in different functional vinegars, which could widen the knowledge of bioactive factor in vinegars and provide new ideas for further development of functional vinegar beverages.",

        "Abstract": "Generative molecular models generate novel molecules with desired properties by searching chemical space. Traditional combinatorial optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, have demonstrated superior performance in various molecular optimization tasks. However, these methods do not utilize docking simulation to inform the design process, and heavy dependence on the quality and quantity of available data, as well as require additional structural optimization to become candidate drugs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model named DockingGA that combines Transformer neural networks and genetic algorithms to generate molecules with better binding affinity for specific targets. In order to generate high quality molecules, we chose the Self-referencing Chemical Structure Strings to represent the molecule and optimize the binding affinity of the molecules to different targets. Compared to other baseline models, DockingGA proves to be the optimal model in all docking results for the top 1, 10 and 100 molecules, while maintaining 100% novelty. Furthermore, the distribution of physicochemical properties demonstrates the ability of DockingGA to generate molecules with favorable and appropriate properties. This innovation creates new opportunities for the application of generative models in practical drug discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, the core idea of the refined method of population spatial distribution is to establish a correlation between the population and auxiliary data at the administrative-unit level and, then, refine it to the grid unit. However, this method ignores the advantages of public population spatial distribution data. Given these problems, this study proposed a partition strategy using the natural break method at the grid-unit level, which adopts the population density to constrain the land class weight and redistributes the population under the dual constraints of land class and area weights. Accordingly, we used the dasymetric method to refine the population distribution data. The study established a partition model for public population spatial distribution data and auxiliary data at the grid-unit level and, then, refined it to smaller grid units. This method effectively utilizes the public population spatial distribution data and solves the problem of the dataset being not sufficiently accurate to describe small-scale regions and low resolutions. Taking the public WorldPop population spatial distribution dataset as an example, the results indicate that the proposed method has higher accuracy than other public datasets and can also describe the actual spatial distribution characteristics of the population accurately and intuitively. Simultaneously, this provides a new concept for research on population spatial distribution refinement methods.",

        "Abstract": "Peptide ALW (ALWPPNLHAWVP) targeting anti-dsDNA antibodies has shown promising therapeutic effects in alleviating lupus nephritis, but is potentially limited by poor stability and non-kidney targeting. We recently developed a D-form modified ALW, called D-ALW, which has the capacity to widely inhibit pathogenic polyclonal anti-dsDNA antibody reactions. Further modification of D-ALW using PEG-PLGA nanoparticles to enhance good kidney-targeting ability and extend half-life. Here, we demonstrate that the D-form modified ALW maintains higher binding and inhibition efficiencies and achieves higher stability. Most importantly, D-ALW nanoparticles exhibit excellent kidney-targeting ability and prolong the half-life of the peptides in BALB/c mice. Additionally, compared to D-ALW, D-ALW nanoparticles significantly reduce the glomerular deposition of IgG and C3, improve renal histopathologies, such as glomerular proliferation and inflammatory cells infiltration, and markedly prolong lifespan in MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice. Overall, these results establish that the D-ALW nanoparticles offer synergistic benefits in both safety and efficacy, providing long-term renal preservation and treatment advantages in lupus nephritis.",

        "Abstract": "The relationship between remnant cholesterol (RC) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in the context of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) remains an area of ambiguity. This investigation was designed to elucidate the potential association between RC and HOMA-IR in a cohort of American adults diagnosed with MAFLD. Data from 5533 participants were procured from the 2017-2018 US National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES) databases. A weighted linear regression model was employed to analyze the association between RC and HOMA-IR in the context of MAFLD. Preliminary analysis revealed that 44.67% of the participants were diagnosed with MAFLD, with a higher prevalence observed in individuals aged 50-64 years (31.84%, p < 0.0001) and in males compared to females (53.48% vs. 46.52%, p < 0.0001). A positive correlation was identified between RC and HOMA-IR in MAFLD patients. The threshold effect analysis model indicated a breakpoint at RC = 30 mg/dl, with a more pronounced positive correlation when RC < 30 mg/dl (β = 0.17, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis further demonstrated that among all lipid parameters, RC exhibited the largest area under the curve. The study findings suggest a positive correlation between RC and HOMA-IR in MAFLD patients, indicating that elevated RC may serve as an independent risk factor for MAFLD.",

        "Abstract": "Aggression is an instinctive behavior that has been reported to be influenced by early-life stress. However, the potential effects of acute stress during the postweaning period, a key stage for brain development, on defensive aggression and the associated mechanism remain poorly understood. In the present study, aggressive behaviors were evaluated in adolescent mice exposed to postweaning stress. Serum corticosterone and testosterone levels, neural dendritic spine density, and gut microbiota composition were determined to identify the underlying mechanism. Behavioral analysis showed that postweaning stress reduced locomotor activity in mice and decreased defensive aggression in male mice. ELISA results showed that postweaning stress reduced serum testosterone levels in female mice. Golgi staining analysis demonstrated that postweaning stress decreased neural dendritic spine density in the medial prefrontal cortex of male mice. 16S rRNA sequencing results indicated that postweaning stress altered the composition of the gut microbiota in male mice. Combined, these results suggested that postweaning stress alters defensive aggression in male mice, which may be due to changes in neuronal structure as well as gut microbiota composition. Our findings highlight the long-lasting and sex-dependent effects of early-life experience on behaviors.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer treatment might cause heart failure and deteriorate the patients' quality of life. Despite the wide use of conventional echocardiography, it often fails to detect cardiotoxicity until advanced cardiac dysfunction at potentially irreversible stages. Advanced techniques, such as three-dimensional imaging and strain analysis in stress echocardiography, have shown promise in identifying cardiotoxicity at subclinical stages, even when traditional measures remain within normal ranges. These novel techniques have been shown to identify cardiac impairment in 30%-50% of the patients undergoing potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy, which allows for early intervention and enhanced patient management. Although professional societies are advocating for the inclusion of these techniques into routine monitoring protocols, more research is needed to optimize and standardize their use across various centers and chemotherapeutic agents. This review explores the role of stress echocardiography in the early detection and monitoring of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. It delves into current knowledge and emerging research, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding and to highlight areas worthy of further investigation.",

        "Abstract": "The unregulated dismantling and improper disposal of electronic waste lead to severe soil contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Constructed wetlands (CWs) play an important role in PCBs removal as a result of the co-existence of anaerobic and aerobic conditions. However, the effects and mechanisms of different PCBs concentrations in soils on plant uptake and PCBs degradation within CWs are unclear. We evaluated the uptake and degradation of PCBs at different concentrations by Myriophyllum aquaticum (Vell.) Verdc. Planting significantly increased PCBs removal by 8.70% (p < 0.05) in soils with 1500 and 2500 μg/kg PCBs, whereas no significant effect was observed at 500 and 1000 μg/kg. PCBs levels did not significantly affect plant growth and PCBs accumulation. The contribution of plant uptake to PCBs removal was only 0.10-0.12%, indicating that microbial degradation was the dominant pathway for PCBs removal after planting with M. aquaticum. In the treatments with PCBs ≥ 1500 μg/kg, M. aquaticum increased the microbial population, altered the microbial community structure and enriched PCB-degrading bacteria. Functional prediction revealed that microbes in M. aquaticum rhizosphere secreted more peroxidase and glycosyltransferase than non-plant control, which were likely involved in PCBs metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "A challenge to many real-world data streams is imbalance with concept drift, which is one of the most critical tasks in anomaly detection. Learning nonstationary data streams for anomaly detection has been well studied in recent years. However, most of the researches assume that the class of data streams is relatively balanced. Only a few approaches tackle the joint issue of imbalance and concept drift. To overcome this joint issue, we propose an ensemble learning method with generative adversarial network-based sampling and consistency check (EGSCC) in this paper. First, we design a comprehensive anomaly detection framework that includes an oversampling module by generative adversarial network, an ensemble classifier, and a consistency check module. Next, we introduce double encoders into GAN to better capture the distribution characteristics of imbalanced data for oversampling. Then, we apply the stacking ensemble learning to deal with concept drift. Four base classifiers of SVM, KNN, DT and RF are used in the first layer, and LR is used as meta classifier in second layer. Last but not least, we take consistency check of the incremental instance and check set to determine whether it is anormal by statistical learning, instead of threshold-based method. And the validation set is dynamic updated according to the consistency check result. Finally, three artificial data sets obtained from Massive Online Analysis platform and two real data sets are used to verify the performance of the proposed method from four aspects: detection performance, parameter sensitivity, algorithm cost and anti-noise ability. Experimental results show that the proposed method has significant advantages in anomaly detection of imbalanced data streams with concept drift.",

        "Abstract": "Sen1 is an essential helicase for factor-dependent transcription termination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose molecular-motor mechanism has not been well addressed. Here, we use single-molecule experimentation to better understand the molecular-motor determinants of its action on RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex. We quantify Sen1 translocation activity on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), finding elevated translocation rates, high levels of processivity and ATP affinities. Upon deleting the N- and C-terminal domains, or further deleting different parts of the prong subdomain, which is an essential element for transcription termination, Sen1 displays changes in its translocation properties, such as slightly reduced translocation processivities, enhanced translocation rates and statistically identical ATP affinities. Although these parameters fulfil the requirements for Sen1 translocating along the RNA transcript to catch up with a stalled Pol II complex, we observe significant reductions in the termination efficiencies as well as the factions of the formation of the previously described topological intermediate prior to termination, suggesting that the prong may preserve an interaction with Pol II complex during factor-dependent termination. Our results underscore a more detailed rho-like mechanism of Sen1 and a critical interaction between Sen1 and Pol II complex for factor-dependent transcription termination in eukaryotes.",

        "Abstract": "The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and complexity in biological tissues. However, the nature of large, sparse scRNA-seq datasets and privacy regulations present challenges for efficient cell identification. Federated learning provides a solution, allowing efficient and private data use. Here, we introduce scFed, a unified federated learning framework that allows for benchmarking of four classification algorithms without violating data privacy, including single-cell-specific and general-purpose classifiers. We evaluated scFed using eight publicly available scRNA-seq datasets with diverse sizes, species and technologies, assessing its performance via intra-dataset and inter-dataset experimental setups. We find that scFed performs well on a variety of datasets with competitive accuracy to centralized models. Though Transformer-based model excels in centralized training, its performance slightly lags behind single-cell-specific model within the scFed framework, coupled with a notable time complexity concern. Our study not only helps select suitable cell identification methods but also highlights federated learning's potential for privacy-preserving, collaborative biomedical research.",

Genomic analysis revealed that Halarchaeum members exhibit a predilection for amino acids as their primary energy source in high-salinity environments over carbohydrates. Genome analysis unveiled the presence of crucial genes associated with metabolic pathways, including the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, semi-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway, and the urea cycle. Furthermore, the genomic analysis indicated that Halarchaeum members employ diverse mechanisms for osmotic regulation (encompassing both salt-in and salt-out strategies). Halarchaeum members also encode genes to alleviate acid and heat stress. The average nucleotide identity value between Halarchaeum solikamskense and Halarchaeum nitratireducens exceeded the established threshold (95%-96%) for defining distinct species. This high similarity suggests a close relationship between these two species, prompting the proposal to reclassify Halarchaeum solikamskense as a heterotypic synonym of Halarchaeum nitratireducens. The results of this study contribute to our knowledge of taxonomic classification and shed light on the adaptive strategies employed by Halarchaeum species in their specific ecological niches.",

        "Abstract": "Cyanophyta has the potential to produce biocrude via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). However, aqueous phase products (APs), as by-products of HTL, pose a risk of eutrophication for the high levels of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) can efficiently convert organics into small molecules, offering a technique for the harmless treatment of APs. Effects of holding time, pressure, and moisture content on the biocrude yields from isothermal HTL (300 °C) and fast HTL (salt bath temperature of 500 °C) were comprehensively investigated. Biocrude properties were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR and GC-MS. Subsequently, the APs obtained under the conditions producing the highest biocrude yield were subjected to SCWO at 550 °C with different oxidation coefficients (n) from 0 to 2. Removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH",

        "Abstract": "Autochthonous bioaugmentation and nutrient biostimulation are promising bioremediation methods for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in contaminated agricultural soils, but little is known about their combined working mechanism. In this study, a microcosm trial was conducted to explore the combined mechanism of autochthonous fungal bioaugmentation and ammonium nitrogen biostimulation, using DNA stable-isotope-probing (DNA-SIP) and microbial network analysis. Both treatments significantly improved phenanthrene (PHE) removal, with their combined application producing the best results. The microbial community composition was notably altered by all bioremediation treatments, particularly the PHE-degrading bacterial and fungal taxa. Fungal bioaugmentation removed PAHs through extracellular enzyme secretion but reduced soil microbial diversity and ecological stability, while nitrogen biostimulation promoted PAH dissipation by stimulating indigenous soil degrading microbes, including fungi and key bacteria in the soil co-occurrence networks, ensuring the ecological diversity of soil microorganisms. The combination of both approaches proved to be the most effective strategy, maintaining a high degradation efficiency and relatively stable soil biodiversity through the secretion of lignin hydrolytic enzymes by fungi, and stimulating the reproduction of soil native degrading microbes, especially the key degraders in the co-occurrence networks. Our findings provide a fresh perspective of the synergy between fungal bioaugmentation and nitrogen biostimulation, highlighting the potential of this combined bioremediation approach for in situ PAH-contaminated soils.",

        "Abstract": "Dentine is a major component of teeth and is responsible for many of their functions, such as mastication and neural sensation/transduction. Over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on dentine development and regeneration using a variety of research models, including in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro models. In vivo animal models play a crucial role in the exploration of biochemical factors that are involved in dentine development, whereas ex vivo and in vitro models contribute mainly to the identification of biophysical factors in dentine regeneration, of which mechanical force is most critical. In the present review, research models involved in studies related to dentine development and regeneration were screened from publications released in recent years and summarised comprehensively, particularly in vivo animal models including prokaryotic microinjection, Cre/LoxP, CRISPR/Cas9, ZFN and TALEN, and scaffold-based in vitro and ex vivo models. The latter were further divided by the interactive forces. Summarising these research models will not only benefit the development of future dentine-related studies but also provide hints regarding the evolution of novel dentine regeneration strategies.",

        "Abstract": "DNA origami has been used as biotemplates for growing a range of inorganic materials to create novel organic-inorganic hybrid nanomaterials. Recently, the solution-based silicification of DNA has been used to grow thin silica shells on DNA origami. However, the silicification reaction is sensitive to the reaction conditions and often results in uncontrolled DNA origami aggregation, especially when growth of thicker silica layers is desired. Here, we investigated how site-specifically placed polynucleotide brushes influence the silicification of DNA origami. Our experiments showed that long DNA brushes, in the form of single- or double-stranded DNA, significantly suppress the aggregation of DNA origami during the silicification process. Furthermore, we found that double-stranded DNA brushes selectively promote silica growth on DNA origami surfaces. These observations were supported and explained by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides new insights into our understanding of the silicification process on DNA and provides a powerful toolset for the development of novel DNA-based organic-inorganic nanomaterials.",

        "Title": "Endometrial stromal cell autophagy-dependent ferroptosis caused by iron overload in ovarian endometriosis is inhibited by the ATF4-xCT pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death process characterized by the accumulation of lethal oxidative damage. Localized iron overload is a unique clinical phenomenon in ovarian endometriosis (EM). However, the role and mechanism of ferroptosis in the course of ovarian EM remain unclear. Traditionally, autophagy promotes cell survival. However, a growing body of research suggests that autophagy promotes ferroptosis under certain conditions. This study aimed to clarify the status of ferroptosis in ovarian EM and explore the mechanism(s) by which iron overload causes ferroptosis and ectopic endometrial resistance to ferroptosis in human. The results showed increased levels of iron and reactive oxygen species in ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). Some ferroptosis and autophagy proteins in the ectopic tissues differed from those in the eutopic endometrium. In vitro, iron overload caused decreased cellular activity, increased lipid peroxidation levels, and mitochondrial morphological changes, whereas ferroptosis inhibitors alleviated these phenomena, illustrating activated ferroptosis. Iron overload increased autophagy, and ferroptosis caused by iron overload was inhibited by autophagy inhibitors, indicating that ferroptosis caused by iron overload was autophagy-dependent. We also confirmed the effect of iron overload and autophagy on lesion growth in vivo by constructing a mouse EM model; the results were consistent with those of the in vitro experiments of human tissue and endometrial stomal cells. However, ectopic lesions in patients can resist ferroptosis caused by iron overload, which can promote cystine/glutamate transporter hyperexpression by highly expressing activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). In summary, local iron overload in ovarian EM can activate autophagy-related ferroptosis in ESCs, and ectopic lesions grow in a high-iron environment via ATF4-xCT while resisting ferroptosis. The effects of iron overload on other cells in the EM environment require further study. This study deepens our understanding of the role of ferroptosis in ovarian EM.",

        "Abstract": "The spread of many infectious diseases relies on aerosol transmission to the respiratory tract. Here we design an intranasal mask comprising a positively-charged thermosensitive hydrogel and cell-derived micro-sized vesicles with a specific viral receptor. We show that the positively charged hydrogel intercepts negatively charged viral aerosols, while the viral receptor on vesicles mediates the entrapment of viruses for inactivation. We demonstrate that when displaying matched viral receptors, the intranasal masks protect the nasal cavity and lung of mice from either severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or influenza A virus. With computerized tomography images of human nasal cavity, we further conduct computational fluid dynamics simulation and three-dimensional printing of an anatomically accurate human nasal cavity, which is connected to human lung organoids to generate a human respiratory tract model. Both simulative and experimental results support the suitability of intranasal masks in humans, as the likelihood of viral respiratory infections induced by different variant strains is dramatically reduced.",

        "Title": "Effects of recreational small-sided games from different team sports on the improvement of aerobic fitness in youth sedentary populations: A systematic review.",
        "Abstract": "Aerobic fitness is a critical aspect of overall health and well-being, essential for maintaining a high quality of life. Unfortunately, sedentary behavior has been on the rise among young adults, and this has had a negative impact on their aerobic fitness levels. Therefore, it is crucial to identify enjoyable physical exercise training programs that can play a pivotal role in improving aerobic fitness. The objective of this study was to systematically review the experimental studies concerning the impact of small-sided games (SSGs) training programs, implemented across various team sports, on the enhancement of aerobic fitness in a youth sedentary population. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science on August 01, 2023. Our eligibility criteria focused on studies involving sedentary youth populations (aged <18 years) as the target population. These studies needed to incorporate interventions based on SSGs as the intervention of interest, comparing them to passive or control groups as the comparator. The primary outcomes of interest were related to maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), assessed either directly or indirectly, or the results of field-based cardiorespiratory tests. We specifically considered two- or multi-arm randomized controlled studies as the study design of interest. Out of the initial pool of 1980 studies, we reviewed 38 full-text articles, ultimately selecting and analyzing 13 studies for inclusion in our review. Among the studies included, a total of 1281 participants were enrolled in SSG-based interventions, while 744 participants acted as part of the control groups. Regarding the impact on VO2max, the six studies that investigated this outcome showed varying improvements, ranging from 2.2 % to 31.3 % when participants were exposed to SSGs. In terms of the outcome related to endurance performance in field-based tests, the eight studies that examined this aspect found that participants exposed to SSGs showed improvements ranging from 0.1 % to 79.8 %. In conclusion, this systematic review suggests that SSG-based interventions conducted among sedentary youth populations can play a positive role in improving their aerobic fitness. This improvement in aerobic fitness can have potential positive impacts on their overall health and quality of life.",

        "Abstract": "Discrepancies between experimental and theoretical results in the study of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) have been a major long-standing problem in thermoelectric technology. In this Letter, we report that, besides interfacial resistance, the inevitable heat leap caused by the Peltier effect is the main factor affecting the conversion efficiency of TEGs. In fact, the heat leap is proven to have an impact of approximately 10% on the conversion efficiency of common TEGs. In addition, we enhance the formula for maximum conversion efficiency with heat leap from the classical expression to allow for the prediction of the performance of advanced materials in TEGs. For the first time, the experimental data from conversion efficiency corresponds exactly to that obtained theoretically by considering both the heat leap and interfacial resistivity.",

        "Abstract": "Although cotton dressing is one of the most commonly used wound management materials, it lacks antimicrobial and healing-promoting activity. This work developed a multilayer electroactive composite cotton dressing (Ag/Zn@Cotton/Paraffin) with exudate-activated electrical stimulation and antibacterial activity by the green and sustainable magnetron-sputtering and spraying methods. The inner hydrophilic layer of the cotton dressing was magnetron sputtered with silver/zinc galvanic couple arrays (Ag/Zn), which can be activated by wound exudate, generating an electrical stimulation (ES) into the wound. The Ag/Zn@Cotton showed efficient antibacterial activities against S. aureus and E. coli. Meanwhile, the paraffin-sprayed outer surface showed excellent antibacterial adhesion rates for S. aureus (99.82 %) and E. coli (97.92 %). The in vitro cell experiments showed that the ES generated by Ag/Zn@Cotton/Paraffin increased the migration of fibroblasts, and the in vivo mouse model indicated that the Ag/Zn@Cotton/Paraffin could enhance wound healing via re-epithelialization, inflammatory inhibition, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis. MTT method and live/dead staining showed that Ag/Zn@Cotton/Paraffin had no significant cytotoxic effects. This work may shed some light on designing and fabricating multi-functional electroactive composited dressings based on traditional biomedical textiles.",

        "Abstract": "Surface plasmonic waves (SPWs) that propagate at meta-dielectric interface are a good source of information carrier waves for on-chip photonic devices, where SPW excitation is one key procedure. Recently, controlling SPW excitation using metasurface methods has drawn considerable attention owing to their design flexibility, wherein achieving dynamic control is of great importance. However, most studies in the terahertz regime so far are working in a passive way or only dynamically controllable at the propagation process. In this work, an active design for controlling terahertz SPWs at the excitation process is proposed using graphene metasurfaces based on the manipulation of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect. Large modulation depth with controllable SPW excitations is demonstrated. Our method is flexible and promising in achieving more controlling degree of freedom, which can find broadband applications in future integrated devices and systems.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a worldwide prevalent disease that imposes a significant socioeconomic burden on individuals and healthcare systems. Achieving cartilage regeneration in patients with osteoarthritis remains challenging clinically. In this work, we construct a multiple hydrogen-bond crosslinked hydrogel loaded with tannic acid and Kartogenin by polyaddition reaction as a cell-free scaffold for in vivo cartilage regeneration, which features ultra-durable mechanical properties and stage-dependent drug release behavior. We demonstrate that the hydrogel can withstand 28000 loading-unloading mechanical cycles and exhibits fast shape memory at body temperature (30 s) with the potential for minimally invasive surgery. We find that the hydrogel can also alleviate the inflammatory reaction and regulate oxidative stress in situ to establish a microenvironment conducive to healing. We show that the sequential release of tannic acid and Kartogenin can promote the migration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into the hydrogel scaffold, followed by the induction of chondrocyte differentiation, thus leading to full-thickness cartilage regeneration in vivo. This work may provide a promising solution to address the problem of cartilage regeneration.",

Spontaneous fast ripples are always pathological, while ripples may be physiological or pathological. Distinguishing physiological from pathological ripples is important not only for designating epileptogenic brain regions, but also for investigations that study ripples in the context of memory encoding, consolidation, and recall in patients with epilepsy. Many studies have sought to identify distinguishing features between pathological and physiological ripples over the past two decades. Physiological and pathological ripples differ with respect to their spatial location, cellular mechanisms, morphology, and coupling with background electroencephalographic activity. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that differentiating between pathological and physiological ripples can improve surgical outcome prediction. In this review, we summarize the characteristics, differences, and applications of pathological and physiological HFOs and discuss strategies for their clinical translation.",

        "Title": "People in Tight Cultures and Tight Situations Wear Masks More: Evidence From Three Large-Scale Studies in China.",
        "Abstract": "Studies have found large differences in masks use during the pandemic. We found evidence that cultural tightness explains mask use differences and this association was more robust in tight situations like subways. In Study 1, we observed 23,551 people's actual mask use in public places around China. People wore masks more in tight situations; however, differences did not extend to outdoor streets and public parks, where norms are looser. We replicated this finding using a data from 15,985 people across China. Finally, in a preregistered study we observed mask use with the removal of COVID-19 restrictions, people still wore masks more in tight situations like subways than in loose situations of parks. These findings suggest that norm tightness has a lasting association with people's health-protective behaviors, especially in tight situations. It provides insight into how different cultures might respond with future pandemics and in what situations people adopt health-protective behaviors.",

        "Abstract": "Ischemic diseases lead to considerable morbidity and mortality, yet conventional clinical treatment strategies for therapeutic angiogenesis fall short of being impactful. Despite the potential of biomaterials to deliver pro-angiogenic molecules at the infarct site to induce angiogenesis, their efficacy has been impeded by aberrant vascular activation and off-target circulation. Here, we present a semisynthetic low-molecular sulfated chitosan oligosaccharide (SCOS) that efficiently induces therapeutic arteriogenesis with a spontaneous generation of collateral circulation and blood reperfusion in rodent models of hind limb ischemia and myocardial infarction. SCOS elicits anti-inflammatory macrophages' (Mφs') differentiation into perivascular Mφs, which in turn directs artery formation via a cell-to-cell communication rather than secretory factor regulation. SCOS-mediated arteriogenesis requires a canonical Notch signaling pathway in Mφs via the glycosylation of protein O-glucosyltransferases 2, which results in promoting arterial differentiation and tissue repair in ischemia. Thus, this highly bioactive oligosaccharide can be harnessed to direct efficiently therapeutic arteriogenesis and perfusion for the treatment of ischemic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Emerging evidence shows that KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) depends on glutamine (Gln) for survival and progression, indicating that targeting Gln metabolism may be a promising therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutant CRC. However, the precise mechanism by which Gln metabolism reprogramming promotes and coordinates KRAS-mutant CRC progression remains to be fully investigated. Here, we discovered that solute carrier 25 member 21 (SLC25A21) expression was downregulated in KRAS-mutant CRC, and that SLC25A21 downregulation was correlated with poor survival of KRAS-mutant CRC patients. SLC25A21 depletion selectively accelerated the growth, invasion, migration, and metastasis of KRAS-mutant CRC cells in vitro and in vivo, and inhibited Gln-derived α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) efflux from mitochondria, thereby potentiating Gln replenishment, accompanied by increased GTP availability for persistent KRAS activation in KRAS-mutant CRC. The restoration of SLC25A21 expression impaired the KRAS-mutation-mediated resistance to cetuximab in KRAS-mutant CRC. Moreover, the arrested α-KG efflux that occurred in response to SLC25A21 depletion inhibited the activity of α-KG-dependent DNA demethylases, resulting in a further decrease in SLC25A21 expression. Our studies demonstrate that SLC25A21 plays a significant role as a tumor suppressor in KRAS-mutant CRC by antagonizing Gln-dependent anaplerosis to limit GTP availability for KRAS activation, which suggests potential alternative therapeutic strategies for KRAS-mutant CRC.",

        "Abstract": "The effects of applying biochar with the same characteristics and at the same dose on the storage, composition, and underlying mechanisms of native organic carbon (n-SOC) dynamics in different ecosystems are still unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of biochar amendment (7 years) on carbon sequestration and the n-SOC pools of woodland, lawn, and greenhouse soils. The 'water floating method' and improved 'combustion loss method' were used in this study to quantify residual biochar in soil. The results showed that after 7 years, the amount of biochar left in woodland, lawn, and greenhouse soils was 67.12 %, 87.50 %, and 88.13 % of the initial applied amount, respectively. And the n-SOC content increased approximately 2.07, 3.07, and 0.22 times, respectively, mainly due to increases in the native soil humin (n-HM) content of the soil. Biochar also increased the proportion of large aggregates in woodland and lawn soil and increased the t-SOC content of aggregates in each particle size fraction. Additionally, biochar increased the t-SOC of greenhouse soil aggregates but had no significant effect on the distribution of aggregates. The presence of biochar increased native soil easily oxidizable carbon (n-EOC) and microbial biomass carbon (n-MBC) in all three ecosystems. And increases in n-MBC in woodland and lawn soils occurred, which promoted the depletion of native soil hot water dissolvable organic carbon (n-HWOC) and increased CO",

        "Abstract": "We proposed an optical fiber salinity sensor with a composite Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity structure for simultaneous measurement of temperature and salinity based on microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology. The sensor contains two sensing cavities. The silicon cavity is used for temperature sensing, and the seawater cavity processed by the glass microstructure is sensitive to the refractive index of seawater for salinity sensing. At the same time, the influence of the salinity-temperature cross-sensitivity error of the seawater cavity is effectively compensated by using the temperature single parameter sensitivity characteristics of the silicon cavity. The structural design of the sensor seawater cavity includes a cross-shaped groove and a cylindrical fluid cavity. The surface hydrophilicity treatment was performed on the interior of the cavity to solve the effect of no water injection in the cavity caused by the miniaturization of the sensor. The optical path difference (OPD) demodulation method is used to demodulate the two F-P cavities with large dynamic range and high resolution. In the range of 5∼40°C and 5∼ 40 ‰, the temperature and salinity sensitivity of the sensor can reach 110.25 nm/°C and 178.75 nm/‰, respectively, and the resolution can reach 5.02 × 10",

        "Abstract": "The accurate identification and real-time detection of obstacles have been considered the premise to ensure the safe operation of coal mine driverless electric locomotives. The harsh coal mine roadway environment leads to low detection accuracy of obstacles based on traditional detection methods such as LiDAR and machine learning, and these traditional obstacle detection methods lead to slower detection speeds due to excessive computational reasoning. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a deep learning-based ODEL-YOLOv5s detection model based on the conventional YOLOv5s. In this work, several data augmentation methods are introduced to increase the diversity of obstacle features in the dataset images. An attention mechanism is introduced to the neck of the model to improve the focus of the model on obstacle features. The three-scale prediction of the model is increased to a four-scale prediction to improve the detection ability of the model for small obstacles. We also optimize the localization loss function and non-maximum suppression method of the model to improve the regression accuracy and reduce the redundancy of the prediction boxes.

        "Abstract": "Hydrogels with flexible and stretchable properties are ideal for applications in wearable sensors. However, traditional hydrogel-based sensors suffer from high brittleness and low electrical sensitivity. In this case, to solve this dilemma, a macromolecular polyurethane crosslinking agent (PCA) was designed and prepared; after that, PCA and two-dimensional (2D) MXene nanosheets were both introduced into a covalently crosslinked network to enhance the comprehensive mechanical and electrochemical properties of the hydrogels. The macromolecular polyurethane crosslinking agent promotes high-tensile strength and highly stretchable capacity by suitable covalent crosslinking. The optimized hydrogel, which exhibited maximum tensile strength and maximum elongation at break, had results of 1.21 MPa and 644%, respectively. Two-dimensional MXene nanosheets provide hydrogel with high electrical conductivity and strain sensitivity, producing a wearable device for the continuous monitoring of human movements and facial microexpressions. This study demonstrated an efficient structure design strategy for building mechanically tough, highly stretchable, and sensitive dual-mode MXenes-based wearable sensors.",

In physiological functions, ZNF703 play significant roles in embryonic development, especially in the nervous system. As an transcription factors with zinc finger domains, abnormal regulation of the ZNF703 protein is associated with enhanced proliferation, invasion, and metastasis as well as drug resistance in many tumors, although mechanisms of action vary depending on the specific tumor microenvironment. ZNF703 lacks a nuclear localization sequence despite its function requiring nuclear DNA binding. The purpose of this review is to summarize the architecture of ZNF703, its roles in tumorigenesis, and tumor progression, as well as future oncology therapeutic prospects, which have implications for understanding tumor susceptibility and progression.",

        "Abstract": "Microalgae present a viable mechanism for purifying aquatic environments through the absorption of organic pollutants. In this paper, Chlorella protothecoides was cultured in a tetracycline environment, and biochar was added during the cultivation process. Compared with conventionally cultured Chlorella protothecoides, the addition of biochar for cultivation under a tetracycline environment increased the biomass of Chlorella protothecoides by 13.26 %. Moreover, the adsorption of tetracycline by biochar alone was not complete, but when mixed with Chlorella protothecoides, tetracycline was completely removed, which proved the biosorption of Chlorella protothecoides for low concentrations of tetracycline. Finally, the cultured Chlorella protothecoides was used further to prepare electrode materials, and it was found that the specific capacitance of the material reached 233.15F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. In this study, the use of biochar and Chlorella protothecoides to jointly adsorb tetracycline is of great significance for environmental protection and microalgae cultivation.",

        "Abstract": "Adjuvants are an indispensable component of vaccines, but there are few adjuvants for human vaccines. H2 receptor blockers, inhibiting gastric acid secretion, have immune enhancement effects. Ranitidine (RAN) is a water-soluble H2 receptor blocker, and whether it has an immune-enhancing effect is still unknown. In this study, flow cytometry, western blotting, and immunofluorescence methods were used to analyze whether RAN could activate macrophage polarization to the M1 phenotype in vivo and in vitro. Here, we found that the M1 inflammatory cytokine levels and surface markers in RAW264.7 cells were upregulated by NF-κB activation, possibly through the PI3K-Akt2 signaling pathway, after RAN treatment. Endocytic function was also enhanced by feedback regulation of Akt2/GSK3β/Dynmin1 signaling. Furthermore, to evaluate the adjuvant function of RAN, we used OVA plus RAN as a vaccine to inhibit the growth of B16-OVA tumors in mice. We also found that in the RAN adjuvant group, macrophage polarization to M1, Th1 cell differentiation, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation were significantly upregulated. The tumor growth of mice was inhibited, and the survival rate of mice was significantly improved. This study provides new evidence for the mechanism by which RAN activates the immune response and is expected to provide a new strategy for the research and development of tumor vaccine adjuvants.",

Recent advances in single-cell methodologies, refined disease models, and genetic and epigenetic insights have provided a nuanced understanding of MASH fibrogenesis, with substantial cellular heterogeneity in MASH livers providing potentially targetable cell-cell interactions and behavior. Unlike fibrogenesis, mechanisms underlying fibrosis regression in MASH are still inadequately understood, although antifibrotic targets have been recently identified. A refined antifibrotic treatment framework could lead to noninvasive assessment and targeted therapies that preserve hepatocellular function and restore the liver's architectural integrity.",

However, numerous docking programs, such as AutoDock Vina and Glide, are time-consuming due to the necessity of generating numerous molecular conformations and executing steps like scoring, ranking, and refinement for the ligand-receptor complexes. Consequently, achieving rapid and reliable virtual screening remains a noteworthy challenge. Recently, a team of researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, led by Stärk et al., developed an SE(3)-equivariant geometric deep learning based protein-ligand binding prediction approach, EQUIBIND. In comparison to conventional docking methods, EQUIBIND has the capacity to predict the binding modes of small molecules with target proteins rapidly and precisely. It presents an innovative resolution for high-throughput screening of drug-like compounds.",

        "Abstract": "Co-contamination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and nitrogen (N) is widespread. Here, N removal and PCBs degradation were investigated in constructed wetlands populated with Myriophyllum aquaticum, and the role of N in PCBs degradation was explored as well. Nearly 97% of N was removed in the planted system, whereas less than 40% was removed in the plant-free system. Compared to the treatment with plants and no N amendment, N addition enhanced plant growth by 31.9% and PCBs removal by 9.90%. PCBs attenuation was mainly attributed to microbial degradation rather than plant uptake. Using DNA stable-isotope probing, 26 operational taxonomic units were identified across all treatments, of which 25 were linked to PCBs degradation for the first time. Some PCB-degraders were associated with nitrification/denitrification and were significantly enriched in the treatment that included both plants and N application, indicating that PCBs degradation was promoted by recruiting ammonia-oxidising and denitrifying microbes with PCBs metabolic ability. This was confirmed by the higher A13/A12 ratios for the bphC, amoA, and nirK genes and their significant positive correlations. Overall, the findings clarify the novel mechanism by which N promotes PCBs degradation in constructed wetlands and offers a theoretical basis for efficiently removing inorganic elements and persistent organic pollutants.",

        "Abstract": "The growth in biomedical data resources has raised potential privacy concerns and risks of genetic information leakage. For instance, exome sequencing aids clinical decisions by comparing data through web services, but it requires significant trust between users and providers. To alleviate privacy concerns, the most commonly used strategy is to anonymize sensitive data. Unfortunately, studies have shown that anonymization is insufficient to protect against reidentification attacks. Recently, privacy-preserving technologies have been applied to preserve application utility while protecting the privacy of biomedical data. We present the PICOTEES framework, a privacy-preserving online service of phenotype exploration for genetic-diagnostic variants (https://birthdefectlab.cn:3000/). PICOTEES enables privacy-preserving queries of the phenotype spectrum for a single variant by utilizing trusted execution environment technology, which can protect the privacy of the user's query information, backend models, and data, as well as the final results. We demonstrate the utility and performance of PICOTEES by exploring a bioinformatics dataset. The dataset is from a cohort containing 20,909 genetic testing patients with 3,152,508 variants from the Children's Hospital of Fudan University in China, dominated by the Chinese Han population (>99.9%). Our query results yield a large number of unreported diagnostic variants and previously reported pathogenicity.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid development of renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, and pulsed equipment requires energy storage media to have a high energy storage density and efficiency in a wide temperature range. The state-of-the-art biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film is insufficient to meet the growing demand for energy storage devices due to its low energy storage density and working temperature, which make it a research hotspot for developing dielectric energy storage materials. In this manuscript, based on the epoxy materials that have been shown as a potential energy storage medium, we aim to reduce the influence of the benzene ring delocalization structure on the energy storage losses and enhance the efficiency by gradually replacing them with cyclohexane structures to adjust the segment unsaturation of epoxy materials. The results show that by partially reducing the unsaturation of the curing agent, the epoxy material achieves an excellent high-temperature energy storage density of 2.21 J/cm",

        "Abstract": "The regulation of the expression of genes related to abiotic stress in plants is significantly influenced by the binding of the transcription factor (TF) WRKY to the W-box elements in their promoters. The findings of this study have confirmed that the ability of Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.) to tolerate phosphorus (P) deficiency is regulated by FtWRKY29, which is classified as a member of group II of the WRKY family. The roots predominantly exhibited an enhanced expression of FtWRKY29, which was significantly upregulated in response to low-P-induced stress. The W-box motif was bound to by FtWRKY29 which enhanced the transcription of genes and was localized to the nucleus. The overexpression of FtWRKY29 in Arabidopsis thaliana produced transgenic lines that exhibited phenotypes typical of diminished sensitivity to low-P-induced stress by promoting root growth, increasing P-uptake, and regulating the accumulation of anthocyanin. The low-P-responsive genes, PHT1;1, PHT1;4, and PHO1 were significantly up-regulated in these lines. In addition, the overexpression of FtWRKY29 restored the P-absorption ability of the wrky75 mutant to a certain extent. Moreover, the binding of FtWRKY29 to the promoter of PHT1;1 activated its expression in tobacco. It was also observed that FtWRKY29 interacts with AtMPK3, AtMPK6, FtMPK3, and FtMPK7. This study provides preliminary evidence that FtWRKY29 improved the tolerance of transgenic A. thaliana plants to low-P-induced stress and deepened the understanding of the regulatory mechanism behind the same in Tartary buckwheat.",

        "Abstract": "This study explores natural direct and joint natural indirect effects (JNIE) of prenatal opioid exposure on neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in children mediated through pregnancy complications, major and minor congenital malformations, and adverse neonatal outcomes, using Medicaid claims linked to vital statistics in Rhode Island, United States, 2008-2018. A Bayesian mediation analysis with elastic net shrinkage prior was developed to estimate mean time to NDD diagnosis ratio using posterior mean and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) from Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Simulation studies showed desirable model performance. Of 11,176 eligible pregnancies, 332 had ≥2 dispensations of prescription opioids anytime during pregnancy, including 200 (1.8%) having ≥1 dispensation in the first trimester (T1), 169 (1.5%) in the second (T2), and 153 (1.4%) in the third (T3). A significant JNIE of opioid exposure was observed in each trimester (T1, JNIE = 0.97, 95% CrI: 0.95, 0.99; T2, JNIE = 0.97, 95% CrI: 0.95, 0.99; T3, JNIE = 0.96, 95% CrI: 0.94, 0.99). The proportion of JNIE in each trimester was 17.9% (T1), 22.4% (T2), and 56.3% (T3). In conclusion, adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes jointly mediated the association between prenatal opioid exposure and accelerated time to NDD diagnosis. The proportion of JNIE increased as the timing of opioid exposure approached delivery.",

The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used to identify 252 DEGs (differentially expressed genes), including 112 upregulated genes and 140 downregulated genes, in the spleens of koi carp challenged with A. hydrophila compared to those in the spleens of koi carp treated with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline). DEGs were shown to be involved in 133 pathways by KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analysis. Numerous immunological disease-related pathways, such as the immune defense network for IgA production, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and antigen processing and presentation, were enriched in the DEGs. In addition, the expression levels of 10 randomly screened DEGs, including the inflammatory factor nlrp3 (NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3), cytokine il-8 (interleukin-8), c2 (complement c2), c3 (complement c3), and the lipid mediator cox1 (cyclooxygenase-1), were compared by qPCR. The results showed that six genes, including il-8, cox1, and nlrp3, were upregulated according to both RNA-seq and qPCR validation, while four, including c2 and c3, showed downregulated expression. This result verified a strong correlation between the RNA-seq and qPCR datasets at the expression level. Moreover, this study provided splenic transcriptome data for koi carp during A. hydrophila infection and provided theoretical support for future drug development.",

        "Abstract": "Natural polysaccharides are macromolecular substances with great potential owing to their wide biological activity and low toxicity. However, not all polysaccharides have significant pharmacodynamic activity; hence, appropriate chemical modification methods can be selected according to the unique structural characteristics of polysaccharides to assist in enhancing and promoting the presentation of their biological activities. This review summarizes research progress on modified polysaccharides, including common chemical modification methods, the change in biological activity following modification, and the factors affecting the biological activity of chemically modified polysaccharides. At the same time, the difficulties and challenges associated with the structural modification of natural polysaccharides are also outlined in this review. Thus, research on polysaccharide structure modification is critical for improving the development and utilization of sugar products.",

        "Abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a substantial risk factor for the development and progression of liver cancer, which includes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). Studies utilizing cell fate mapping and single-cell transcriptomics techniques have identified quiescent perisinusoidal hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) as the primary source of activated collagen-producing HSCs and liver cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in HCC and liver metastasis, complemented in iCCA by contributions from portal fibroblasts. At the same time, integrative computational analysis of single-cell, single-nucleus and spatial RNA sequencing data have revealed marked heterogeneity among HSCs and CAFs, with distinct subpopulations displaying unique gene expression signatures and functions. Some of these subpopulations have divergent roles in promoting or inhibiting liver fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis. In this Review, we discuss the dual roles of HSC subpopulations in liver fibrogenesis and their contribution to liver cancer promotion, progression and metastasis. We review the transcriptomic and functional similarities between HSC and CAF subpopulations, highlighting the pathways that either promote or prevent fibrosis and cancer, and the immunological landscape from which these pathways emerge. Insights from ongoing studies will yield novel strategies for developing biomarkers, assessing prognosis and generating new therapies for both HCC and iCCA prevention and treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Liquefaction of microalgae in ethanol offers an eco-friendly bio-oil alternative, but solvent recycling is crucial for sustainability due to extra costs. In this work, Chlorella vulgaris was liquefied in supercritical ethanol at 260 °C, and the solvent phase (SP) separated from bio-oil was recovered and reused. Five liquefaction cycles were performed at identical temperature and pressure conditions to investigate the effects on oil production and nitrogen transformation. The findings demonstrated a gradual increase in water content in recycled SP. Ethanol-water co-solvent as the reaction medium promoted the decomposition and re-polymerization of protein in raw material, thus increasing the bio-oil yield (76.84 %) and higher heating value (33.53 MJ/kg) to some extent. Simultaneously, the relative nitrogen content of bio-oil rose from 8.03 % to 8.52 %, predominantly in the form of nitrogen heterocycles. The potential pathway for nitrogen conversion was revealed, which establishes a theoretical basis for the subsequent denitrification of bio-oil.",

        "Abstract": "The use of bacteria and their biotic components as therapeutics has shown great potential in the treatment of diseases. Orally delivered bacteria improve patient compliance compared with injection-administered bacteria and are considered the preferred mode. However, due to the harsh gastrointestinal environment, the viability and therapeutic efficacy of orally delivered bacteria are significantly reduced in vivo. In recent years, with the rapid development of synthetic biology and nanotechnology, bacteria and biotic components have been engineered to achieve directed genetic reprogramming for construction and precise spatiotemporal control in the gastrointestinal tract, which can improve viability and therapeutic efficiency. Herein, a state-of-the-art review on the current progress of engineered bacterial systems for oral delivery is provided. The different types of bacterial and biotic components for oral administration are first summarized. The engineering strategies of these bacteria and biotic components and their treatment of diseases are next systematically summarized. Finally, the current challenges and prospects of these bacterial therapeutics are highlighted that will contribute to the development of next-generation orally delivered bacteriotherapy.",

In this work, a novel waterborne polyurethane (WPU) micelle with reactive groups on the surface has been prepared as a crosslinker and then reacted with polyacrylamide (PAM) to obtain a polyacrylamide-polyurethane/ionic liquid (PAM-WPU/IL) ionohydrogel. With the aid of ion-dipole interaction and crosslinks in the composite, the ionohydrogel exhibited ultrastretchability (up to 2927%), good mechanical resilience, and excellent self-adhesion strength (46.01 kPa). Furthermore, the ionohydrogel was used as a strain sensor for monitoring human movement with high strain sensitivity (gauge factor = 35). It is believed that this study provides a new idea for designing a multifunctional ionohydrogel for use in wearable electronics.",

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) algorithms have recently been proposed to eliminate the distribution discrepancies without re-annotating training data for new domains. Nevertheless, due to the limited information provided by a single-source domain, single-source UDA (SSUDA) is not an optimal choice when multitemporal and multiregion remote sensing images are available. We propose a multisource UDA (MSUDA) framework SPENet for building extraction, aiming at selecting, purifying, and exchanging information from multisource domains to better adapt the model to the target domain. Specifically, the framework effectively utilizes richer knowledge by extracting target-relevant information from multiple-source domains, purifying target domain information with low-level features of buildings, and exchanging target domain information in an interactive learning manner. Extensive experiments and ablation studies constructed on 12 city datasets prove the effectiveness of our method against existing state-of-the-art methods, e.g., our method achieves 59.1% intersection over union (IoU) on Austin and Kitsap → Potsdam, which surpasses the target domain supervised method by 2.2% .

        "Title": "Regulation of cholesterol metabolism during high fatty acid-induced lipid deposition in calf hepatocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Cholesterol in the circulation is partly driven by changes in feed intake, but aspects of cholesterol metabolism during development of fatty liver are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate mechanisms of cholesterol metabolism in calf hepatocytes challenged with high concentrations of fatty acids (FA). To address mechanistic insights regarding cholesterol metabolism, liver samples were collected from healthy control dairy cows (n = 6; 7-13 d in milk) and cows with fatty liver (n = 6; 7-11 d in milk). In vitro, hepatocytes isolated from 3 healthy female calves (1 d old) were challenged with or without a mix of 1.2 mM FA to induce metabolic stress. In addition, hepatocytes were processed with 10 µmol/L of the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor simvastatin or 6 µmol/L of the cholesterol intracellular transport inhibitor U18666A with or without the 1.2 mM FA mix. To evaluate the role of cholesterol addition, hepatocytes were treated with 0.147 mg/mL methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD + FA) or 0.147 mg/mL MβCD with or without 10 and 100 µmol/L cholesterol before incubation with FA (CHO10 + FA and CHO100 + FA). In vivo data from liver biopsies were analyzed by 2-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. Data from in vitro calf hepatocytes were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Compared with healthy cows, blood plasma total cholesterol and plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol content in cows with fatty liver was markedly lower, whereas the hepatic total cholesterol content did not differ. In contrast, compared with healthy controls, the triacylglycerol content in the liver and the content of FA, β-hydroxybutyrate, and aspartate aminotransferase in the plasma of cows with fatty liver were greater. The results revealed that both fatty liver in vivo and challenge of calf hepatocytes with 1.2 mM FA in vitro led to greater mRNA and protein abundance of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). In contrast, mRNA and protein abundance of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2), acyl coenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase, and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) were lower. Compared with the FA group, the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor simvastatin led to greater protein abundance of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and mRNA abundance of SREBF2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), ACAT2, and lower ABCA1 and FASN protein abundance. In contrast, compared with the FA group, the cholesterol intracellular transport inhibitor U18666A + FA led to greater total cholesterol concentration and greater protein and mRNA abundance of FASN. Compared with the MβCD + FA group, the addition of 10 µmol/L cholesterol led to greater concentration of cholesteryl ester and excretion of apolipoprotein B100, and greater protein and mRNA abundance of ABCA1 and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and lower concentration of malondialdehyde. Overall, a reduction in cholesterol synthesis promoted FA metabolism in hepatocytes likely to relieve the oxidative stress caused by the high FA load. The data suggest that maintenance of normal cholesterol synthesis promotes very low-density lipoprotein excretion and can reduce lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in dairy cows that experience fatty liver.",

        "Abstract": "Dyes that are released into the environment may have negative effects on living organisms. To address this issue, a biomass-derived carbon adsorbent made from Enteromorpha was tested for its ability to remove methyl orange (MO) from wastewater. The adsorbent was found to be effective in removing MO, with a 1:4 impregnation ratio producing an adsorbent that could remove 96.34% of MO from a 200 mg/L solution using only 0.1 g of adsorbent. At higher concentrations, the adsorption capacity increased up to 269.58 mg/g. Through molecular dynamics simulations, it was discovered that after mono-layer adsorption reached saturation, the remaining MO molecules in solution formed hydrogen bonds with the adsorbed MO, which led to further aggregation on the adsorbent surface and increased adsorption capacity. Additionally, theoretical investigations revealed that the adsorption energy of anionic dyes increased with Nitrogen-doped carbon materials, with the pyrrolic-N site having the highest adsorption energy for MO. The carbon material derived from Enteromorpha showed promise in treating wastewater containing anionic dyes, thanks to its high adsorption capacity and strong electrostatic interaction with the sulfonic acid groups of MO.",

        "Abstract": "The use of disinfection materials and instruments is an important part of surgical operation. Hospital environment and surgical equipment need comprehensive sterilization treatment. This process is the key to the success of the operation, and it is also one of the first ways to control the hospital to avoid infection during the operation. The selection of scientific and reasonable sterilization methods for infection will directly affect the safety of medical treatment. In order to improve the antibacterial properties of medical non-woven fabrics, this paper combines two antibacterial methods of sterilization and antibacterial adhesion, and uses the principle of nanotechnology to design that the non-woven fabrics have good blood compatibility in the sterilization process. Then, a new composite antibacterial nanoparticle antibacterial solution is prepared from the synthesized nano‑silver solution, and the antibacterial solution is attached to the non-woven fabric, so that the nano‑silver particles with antibacterial effect are fixed on the surface of the fabric, and its antibacterial effect is measured through the antibacterial test, and excellent hospital infection sterilization technology is prepared and applied to the non-woven fabric products. The fusion experiment of platelets and red blood cells shows that the prepared surface technology combined with antibacterial adhesion and sterilization can effectively fuse with platelets and red blood cells, and can also effectively prevent the adhesion of platelets and red blood cells, and shows good blood compatibility, which is applicable to the sterilization process of hospital infection.",

Global research has generated considerable CDR-related data and well-established knowledge bases and predictive tools. Unfortunately, these resources are fragmented and underutilized. Here, we examine computational resources for exploring CDR caused by target mutations, analyzing these tools based on their functional characteristics, data capacity, data sources, methodologies and performance. We also discuss their disadvantages and provide examples of how potential inhibitors of CDR have been discovered using these resources. This toolkit is designed to help specialists explore resistance occurrence effectively and to explain resistance prediction to non-specialists easily.",

        "Abstract": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a positive-strand RNA virus of the genus Pestivirus in the Flaviviridae family, is the causative agent of bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD). BVDV's unique virion structure, genome, and replication mechanism in the Flaviviridae family render it a useful alternative model for evaluating the effectiveness of antiviral drugs used against the hepatitis C virus (HCV). As one of the most abundant and typical heat shock proteins, HSP70 plays an important role in viral infection caused by the family Flaviviridae and is considered a logical target of viral regulation in the context of immune escape. However, the mechanism of HSP70 in BVDV infection and the latest insights have not been reported in sufficient detail. In this review, we focus on the role and mechanisms of HSP70 in BVDV-infected animals/cells to further explore the possibility of targeting this protein for antiviral therapy during viral infection.",

        "Abstract": "The operating skills of vascular interventionists have an important impact on the effect of surgery. However, current research on behavior recognition and skills learning of interventionists' operating skills is limited. In this study, an innovative deep learning-based multimodal information fusion architecture is proposed for recognizing and analyzing eight common operating behaviors of interventionists. An experimental platform integrating four modal sensors is used to collect multimodal data from interventionists. The ANOVA and Manner-Whitney tests is used for relevance analysis of the data. The analysis results demonstrate that there is almost no significant difference ( p <0.001) between the actions related to the unimodal data, which cannot be used for accurate behavior recognition. Therefore, a study of the fusion architecture based on the existing machine learning classifier and the proposed deep learning fusion architecture is carried out. The research findings indicate that the proposed deep learning-based fusion architecture achieves an impressive overall accuracy of 98.5%, surpassing both the machine learning classifier (93.51%) and the unimodal data (90.05%). The deep learning-based multimodal information fusion architecture proves the feasibility of behavior recognition and skills learning of interventionist's operating skills. Furthermore, the application of deep learning-based multimodal fusion technology of surgeon's operating skills will help to improve the autonomy and intelligence of surgical robotic systems.",

        "Abstract": "Prototype foamy virus (PFV) is an ancient retrovirus that infects humans with persistent latent infections and non-pathogenic consequences. Lifelong latent PFV infections can be caused by restrictive factors in the host. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell regulation during PFV infection are not fully understood. The aim of the study was to investigate whether a zinc finger protein (ZFP), ZNF219, as a transcription factor, can regulate the transcriptional activity of the viral promoter. Here, using transcriptome sequencing, we found that ZNF219, is downregulated in PFV infected cells and that ZNF219 suppresses viral replication by targeting the viral 5'LTR promoter region to repress its transcription. We also found that PFV infection induced abnormal expression of miRNAs targeting the ZNF219-3'UTR to downregulate ZNF219 expression. These findings indicated that ZNF219 may be a potent antiviral factor for suppressing PFV infection, and may shed light on the mechanism of virus-host interactions.",

        "Abstract": "Developing composite materials with optimized mechanics, degradation, and bioactivity for bone regeneration has long been a crucial mission. Herein, a multifunctional Mg/Poly-l-lactic acid (Mg/PLLA) composite membrane based on the \"materials plain\" concept through the accumulative rolling (AR) method is proposed. Results show that at a rolling ratio of 75%, the comprehensive mechanical properties of the membrane in the rolling direction are self-reinforced significantly (elongation at break ≈53.2%, tensile strength ≈104.0 MPa, Young's modulus ≈2.13 GPa). This enhancement is attributed to the directional arrangement and increased crystallization of PLLA molecular chains, as demonstrated by SAXS and DSC results. Furthermore, the AR composite membrane presents a lamellar heterostructure, which not only avoids the accumulation of Mg microparticles (MgMPs) but also regulates the degradation rate. Through the contribution of bioactive MgMPs and their photothermal effect synergistically, the membrane effectively eliminates bacterial infection and accelerates vascularized bone regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the membrane exhibits outstanding rat skull bone regeneration performance in only 4 weeks, surpassing most literature reports. In short, this work develops a composite membrane with a \"one stone, four birds\" effect, opening an efficient avenue toward high-performance orthopedic materials.",

        "Abstract": "Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) mediates necroptosis and inflammation in various pathophysiologies, emerging as a pharmacological target for neurodegenerative and inflammatory indications. This phase I, first-in-human, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of GFH312, an RIPK1 inhibitor, in healthy adults. Subjects received GFH312 as a single ascending dose up to 500 mg (part I) or once-daily repeated doses up to 200 mg for 14 days (part II). PKs were assessed using plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); PDs were assessed by phospho-RIPK1 levels. Seventy-six subjects were enrolled between April 2021 and June 2022: 38 (part I) and 19 (part II) received GFH312; 14 and five received placebo, respectively. At least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) occurred in 42.1% (part I) and 63.2% (part II) of subjects receiving GFH312, compared with 42.9% and 40.0% of subjects receiving placebo, respectively. The most common TEAE was headache (21.1%). Two treatment-related TEAEs were reported in part I and four in part II. No serious TEAEs were reported. Systemic absorption was rapid; exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration and maximum plasma concentration) increased with dose level. The GFH312 CSF concentration post 100 mg single dose was approximately fourfold higher than the half maximal inhibitory concentration of human monocyte-derived macrophages necroptosis with expected central nervous system penetration. Subjects receiving GFH312 had decreased phospho-RIPK1 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells postdose. In conclusion, GFH312 was well-tolerated and demonstrated RIPK1 inhibition in healthy subjects. Ongoing studies will inform the use of GFH312 in potential indications.",

        "Abstract": "Chemotherapy is one of the most commonly treatments of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the drug resistant following chemotherapeutic treatment is a significant challenge in the clinical management of CRC. Therefore, understanding the resistance mechanisms and developing new strategies for enhancing the sensitivity are urgently needed to improve CRC outcome. Connexins contribute to the formation of gap junctions among neighboring cells and then advance gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) for transportation of ions and small molecules. Although the drug resistance resulted from GJIC dysfunctional by aberrant expression of connexins is relatively well understood, the underlying mechanisms of mechanical stiffness mediated by connexin responsible for chemoresistance are largely unknown in CRC. Here, we demonstrated that connexin 43 (CX43) expression was downregulated in CRC and that loss of CX43 expression was positively correlated with metastasis and poor prognosis of CRC patients. The CX43 overexpressing suppressed CRC progression and increased the sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) ",

        "Abstract": "Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is a malignant neoplasm of the kidney and is highly interesting due to its increasing incidence. Many studies have shown that the basement membrane (BM) plays an important role in the development of cancer, and structural and functional changes in the BM can be observed in most renal lesions. However, the role of BM in the malignant progression of PRCC and its impact on prognosis has not been fully studied. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the functional and prognostic value of basement membrane-associated genes (BMs) in PRCC patients. We identified differentially expressed BMs between PRCC tumor samples and normal tissue and systematically explored the relevance of BMs to immune infiltration. Moreover, we constructed a risk signature based on these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Lasso regression analysis and demonstrated their independence using Cox regression analysis. Finally, we predicted 9 small molecule drugs with the potential to treat PRCC and compared the differences in sensitivity to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents between high and low-risk groups to better target patients for more precise treatment planning. Taken together, our study suggested that BMs might play a crucial role in the development of PRCC, and these results might provide new insights into the treatment of PRCC.",

Fucoidan (FD), a marine prebiotic, may further enhance the ability of probiotics to promote ulcer healing. However, neither FD nor probiotics are attached to the oral cavity and neither are well-suited for oral ulcer healing owing to the wet and highly dynamic environment. In this study, probiotic-loaded calcium alginate/fucoidan composite hydrogels were developed for use as bioactive oral ulcer patches. The well-shaped hydrogels exhibited remarkable wet-tissue adhesion, suitable swelling and mechanical properties, sustained probiotic release, and excellent storage durability. Moreover, in vitro biological assays demonstrated that the composite hydrogel exhibited excellent cyto/hemocompatibility and antimicrobial effects. Importantly, compared to commercial oral ulcer patches, bioactive hydrogels show superior therapeutic capability for promoting ulcer healing in vivo by enhancing cell migration, inducing epithelial formation and orderly collagen fiber deposition, as well as facilitating neovascularization. These results demonstrate that this novel composite hydrogel patch demonstrates great potential for the treatment of oral ulcerations.",

        "Title": "Crop Production and Security in Ningjin County of the North China Plain.",
        "Abstract": "Stable growth in grain production is a critical challenge to ensure food security in North China Plain (NCP), an area dominated by smallholder farming. Food production and security of NCP largely depend on how smallholders farm their land. This study took Ningjin County of the NCP as an example to describe the characteristics of crop planting structure and the changes in crop production based on household surveys, statistics, various documents, and literature by descriptive statistics, calculation of crop self-sufficiency, and curve fitting, and aimed to reveal crop security and the influencing factors of crop production at the household level. The results were as follows: (1) Wheat and maize sown area accounted for 61.69% and 47.96% of the total sown area of crops during 2000-2020, increasing at a rate of 3.42% and 5.93%, respectively. Their planted areas increased from 27.52% and 15.54% in 2000 to 47.82% and 44.75% in 2020, respectively. (2) The self-sufficiency rate of maize showed a significant upward trend and reached its peak in 2019. the self-sufficiency rate of wheat also showed an increasing trend, from 192.87% to 617.37%, which indicates that wheat and maize can meet food self-sufficiency and the per capita grain yield is in a safe state. (3) The trends on wheat yield and fertilizer initially grew, then decreased, closely resembling an inverted \"U\", while the maize yield showed a pattern of increasing first and then basically remaining stable, similar to an \"S\" shape. A turning point for fertilizer use (550 kg/ha) was identified, indicating the limits of fertilizer use to increase yield. The national agricultural production and environmental protection policies, continuous improvement of crop varieties, as well as the farmers' traditional practices have significant impacts on crop production. This study will enhance management practices for improved yield, which can support the integrated management of agricultural production in intensive agricultural areas.",

        "Abstract": "The main bottlenecks limiting the practical application of primary explosives are the contradiction between safety and detonation performance, as well as the inherent brittleness of powder charge. Traditional methods to improve sensitivity performance such as adding carbon nanomaterials or embedding metal-organic framework (MOF) structure methods are mostly powders, which are inherently brittle and unsafe. Here, we report three types of typical azide aerogels that can be directly prepared and obtained in this paper by combining electrospinning with aerogel. Their electrostatic sensitivity and flame sensitivity were significantly improved and could be detonated successfully at an initiation voltage of 25 V, demonstrating good ignition performance. This enhancement is primarily due to the porous carbon skeleton structure evolved from a three-dimensional nanofiber aerogel, which has good thermal and electrical conductivity characteristics and can also uniformly load azide particles, contributing to improved explosive system sensitivity. The most important aspect of this method is that it can directly prepare molded explosives, which can be matched with the micro-electrical-mechanical system (MEMS) process, and it offers a new idea for the preparation of high-security molded explosives.",

        "Abstract": "Domain generalization (DG) is one of the critical issues for deep learning in unknown domains. How to effectively represent domain-invariant context (DIC) is a difficult problem that DG needs to solve. Transformers have shown the potential to learn generalized features, since the powerful ability to learn global context. In this article, a novel method named patch diversity Transformer (PDTrans) is proposed to improve the DG for scene segmentation by learning global multidomain semantic relations. Specifically, patch photometric perturbation (PPP) is proposed to improve the representation of multidomain in the global context information, which helps the Transformer learn the relationship between multiple domains. Besides, patch statistics perturbation (PSP) is proposed to model the feature statistics of patches under different domain shifts, which enables the model to encode domain-invariant semantic features and improve generalization. PPP and PSP can help to diversify the source domain at the patch level and feature level. PDTrans learns context across diverse patches and takes advantage of self-attention to improve DG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the tremendous performance advantages of the PDTrans over state-of-the-art DG methods.",

        "Abstract": "Insect cuticle plays a key role in insect survival, adaptation and prosperity by serving as the exoskeleton and the first barrier against environmental stresses. As the major components of insect cuticle, the diverse structural cuticle proteins (CPs) contribute to variation in physical properties and functions of cuticle. However, the roles of CPs in cuticular versatility, especially in the stress response or adaption, remain incompletely understood. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of CP superfamily in the rice-boring pest Chilosuppressalis. A total of 211 CP genes were identified and their encoding proteins were classified into eleven families and three subfamilies (RR1, RR2, and RR3). The comparative genomic analysis of CPs revealed that C. suppressalis had fewer CP genes compared to other lepidopteran species, which largely resulted from a less expansion of his-rich RR2 genes involved in cuticular sclerotization, suggesting long-term boring life of C. suppressalis inside rice hosts might evolutionarily prefer cuticular elasticity rather than cuticular sclerotization. We also investigated the response pattern of all CP genes under insecticidal stresses. >50 % CsCPs were upregulated at least 2-fold under insecticidal stresses. Notably, the majority of the highly upregulated CsCPs formed gene pairs or gene clusters on chromosomes, indicating the rapid response of adjacent CsCPs to insecticidal stress. Most high-response CsCPs encoded AAPA/V/L motifs that are related to cuticular elasticity and >50 % of the sclerotization-related his-rich RR2 genes were also upregulated. These results suggested the potential roles of CsCPs in balancing the elasticity and sclerotization of cuticles, which is essential for the survival and adaptation of plant borers including C. suppressalis. Our study provides valuable information for further developing cuticle-based strategies of both pest management and biomimetic applications.",

The metabolome, as the link between genotypes and phenotypes, has accumulated growing attention. Using a \"multi-omics\" network constructed with a gene-gene network, a metabolite-metabolite network, and a gene-metabolite network to simultaneously prioritize candidate disease-associated metabolites and gene expressions could further utilize gene-metabolite interactions that are not used when prioritizing them separately. However, the number of metabolites is usually 100 times fewer than that of genes.

        "Title": "Targeting lactate metabolism and immune interaction in breast tumor via protease-triggered delivery.",
        "Abstract": "Lactate is abundant in cancer tissues due to active glycolysis (aka Warburg effect) and mediates crosstalk between tumor cells and the immune microenvironment (TIME) to promote the progression of breast cancer. Quercetin (QU) is a potent monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) inhibitor, which can reduce lactate production and secretion of tumor cells. Doxorubicin (DOX) can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), which promotes tumor-specific immune activation. Thus, we propose a combination therapy of QU&DOX to inhibit lactate metabolism and stimulate anti-tumor immunity. To enhance tumor-targeting efficiency, we developed a legumain-activatable liposome system (KC26-Lipo) with modification of KC26 peptide for co-delivery of QU&DOX for modulation of tumor metabolism and TIME in breast cancer. The KC26 peptide is a legumain-responsive, hairpin-structured cell-penetrating peptide (polyarginine) derivative. Legumain is a protease overexpressed in breast tumors, allowing selective activation of the KC26-Lipo to subsequently facilitate intra-tumoral and intracellular penetration. The KC26-Lipo effectively inhibited 4T1 breast cancer tumor growth through chemotherapy and anti-tumor immunity. Besides, inhibition of lactate metabolism suppressed the HIF-1α/VEGF pathway and angiogenesis and repolarized the tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). This work provides a promising breast cancer therapy strategy by regulating lactate metabolism and TIME.",

        "Abstract": "Adoptive T-cell therapy against solid tumours is limited by the apoptosis resistance mechanisms of tumour cells and by the extracellular, immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. Here we report a temperature-sensitive genome-editing nanodevice that can deliver a Cas9 editor with an external trigger which can be used to edit the genome of tumour cells to reduce resistance to apoptosis and modulate the tumour microenvironment via a mild heating trigger. After local or systemic delivery of Cas9, mild heating is induced by non-invasive near-infrared (NIR) light or focused ultrasound (FUS) to activate Cas9, which initiates simultaneous genome editing of HSP70 (HSPA1A) and BAG3 in tumour cells. This disrupts the apoptotic resistance machinery of the tumour cells against adoptive T cells. At the same time, an NIR- or FUS-induced mild thermal effect reshapes the extracellular tumour microenvironment by disrupting the physical barriers and immune suppression. This facilitates the infiltration of adoptive T cells and enhances their therapeutic activity. Mild thermal Cas9 delivery is demonstrated in different murine tumour models which mimic a range of clinical indications, including a tumour model based on humanized patient-derived xenografts. As a result, the non-invasive thermal delivery of Cas9 significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacies of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and chimeric antigen receptor T and shows potential for clinical application.",

        "Abstract": "Skin aging is a complex process involving intricate genetic and environmental factors. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional regulatory landscape of skin aging in canines. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was employed to identify aging-related gene modules. We subsequently validated the expression changes of these module genes in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of human aging skin. Notably, basal cell (BC), spinous cell (SC), mitotic cell (MC), and fibroblast (FB) were identified as the cell types with the most significant gene expression changes during aging. By integrating GENIE3 and RcisTarget, we constructed gene regulation networks (GRNs) for aging-related modules and identified core transcription factors (TFs) by intersecting significantly enriched TFs within the GRNs with hub TFs from WGCNA analysis, revealing key regulators of skin aging. Furthermore, we demonstrated the conserved role of CTCF and RAD21 in skin aging using an H",
