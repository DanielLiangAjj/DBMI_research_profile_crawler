        "Abstract": "Many of the existing composite social determinant of health indices, such as Area Deprivation Index, are constrained by their reliance on geographic approximations and American Community Survey data. This study builds on the body of literature around deprivation indices to construct an individual socioeconomic deprivation index (ISDI) within the NIH's All of Us Data Network by using weighted multiple correspondence analysis on SDOH data elements collected at the participant level. In this study, the correlation between ISDI and another area-approximated index is assessed to the extent possible, along with the changes in an AI models performance due to stratified sampling based on ISDI quintiles. Individual level deprivation indices may have a wide range of utility particularly in the context of precision medicine in both centralized and distributed data networks.",

The current study aims to assess the feasibility of creating an analysis package to link ADI rankings to multiple patient-level EHR datasets transformed into the OMOP CDM. Patients within two cancer cohorts (breast cancer and multiple myeloma) were identified within two OMOP datasets and their records were linked with ADI scores using address information in the OMOP location table. With ADI linked to patient addresses, we generated visualizations showing the geographic distribution of each cohort based on ADI scores. Additionally, further assessment showed that over 89% of patient addresses could successfully be linked with ADI rankings. In conducting this assessment, we have demonstrated that developing a package to link ADI scores with multiple OMOP datasets is feasible.",

On September 1, 2022, a single bivalent booster dose was recommended for adults who had completed a primary vaccination series (with or without subsequent booster doses), with the last dose administered ≥2 months earlier (1). During September 13-November 18, the VISION Network evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a bivalent mRNA booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) compared with 1) no previous vaccination and 2) previous receipt of 2, 3, or 4 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses, among immunocompetent adults aged ≥18 years with an emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounter or hospitalization for a COVID-19-like illness.",

        "Abstract": "During June-October 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 sublineage accounted for most of the sequenced viral genomes in the United States, with further Omicron sublineage diversification through November 2022.* Bivalent mRNA vaccines contain an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain component plus an updated component of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 sublineages. On September 1, 2022, a single bivalent booster dose was recommended for adults who had completed a primary vaccination series (with or without subsequent booster doses), with the last dose administered ≥2 months earlier (1). During September 13-November 18, the VISION Network evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a bivalent mRNA booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) compared with 1) no previous vaccination and 2) previous receipt of 2, 3, or 4 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses, among immunocompetent adults aged ≥18 years with an emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounter or hospitalization for a COVID-19-like illness.",

The diversity and size of AoU's data network result in multifaceted obstacles to data integration that may undermine the usability of patient EHR. Consequently, the AoU team implemented data quality tools to regularly evaluate and communicate EHR data quality issues at scale. The use of systematic feedback and educational tools ultimately increased site engagement and led to quantitative improvements in EHR quality as measured by program- and externally-defined metrics. These improvements enabled the AoU team to save time on troubleshooting EHR and focus on the development of alternate mechanisms to improve the quality of future EHR submissions. While this framework has proven effective, further efforts to automate and centralize communication channels are needed to deepen the program's efforts while retaining its scalability.",

We developed five methods that used a combination of automated, semi-automated and manual approaches for generating measurement concept sets. We validated our concept sets by calculating their frequencies in cohorts from the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) database. For heart transplant patients, the preoperative frequencies of basic metabolic panel concept sets, which we generated by a semi-automated approach, were greater than 99%. We also made concept sets for lumbar puncture and coagulation panels, by automated and manual methods respectively.",

        "Abstract": "CDC recommends that all persons aged ≥18 years receive a single COVID-19 vaccine booster dose ≥2 months after receipt of an Ad.26.COV2.S (Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) adenovirus vector-based primary series vaccine; a heterologous COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is preferred over a homologous (matching) Janssen vaccine for booster vaccination. This recommendation was made in light of the risks for rare but serious adverse events following receipt of a Janssen vaccine, including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome",

        "Abstract": "The volume of solid organ transplant in the United States is increasing, providing improved quality of life and survival for patients with organ failure. The growth of transplant requires a systematized management of transplant outcomes assessment, especially with the movement toward value-based care. However, there are several challenges to analyzing outcomes in the current registry-based, transplant reporting system: (1) longitudinal data points are difficult to capture in outcomes models; (2) data elements are restricted to those that already exist in the registry data; and (3) there is a delay in the release of outcomes report. In this article, we propose an informatics approach to solve these problems by using a \"common data model\" to integrate disparate data sources, data elements, and temporal data points. Adopting such a framework can enable multicenter outcomes analyses among transplant centers, nationally and internationally.",

        "Abstract": "In the 1990s, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital began developing a comprehensive, standards-based immunization information system. The system, known as EzVac, has been operational since 1998 and now includes information on 2 million immunizations administered to more than 260,000 individuals. The system exchanges data with multiple electronic health records, a public health immunization registry, and a standalone personal health record. EzVac modules have recently been incorporated into the OpenMRS application and are being used to enhance immunization efforts in developing nations. We report on our experience with developing and using the EzVac system for 1) clinical care, both in local and global settings, 2) public health reporting, 3) consumer engagement, and 4) clinical and informatics research. We emphasize the advantages of using health IT standards to facilitate immunization information exchange in each of these domains.",
