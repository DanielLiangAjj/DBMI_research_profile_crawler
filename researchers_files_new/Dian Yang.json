        "Abstract": "Maize is a crucial staple crop that ensures global food security by supplying essential nutrients. However, heavy metal (HM) contamination inhibits maize growth, reduces output, and affects food security. Some endophytic fungi (EFs) in maize seeds have the potential to enhance growth and increase dry biomass, offering a solution to mitigate the negative effect of HM contamination. Using these functional EFs could help maintain crop production and ensure food safety in HM-contaminated areas. In the present study, the diversity of EFs in corn grains from various HM-contaminated areas in China was studied through culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. We tested the plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits of several dominant culturable isolates and evaluated the growth-promoting effects of these twenty-one isolates through pot experiments. Both studies showed that HM contamination increased the diversity and richness of corn grain EFs and affected the most dominant endophytes. ",

        "Abstract": "To access degradable polyolefin plastic, non-alternating copolymerization of ethylene (E) and carbon monoxide (CO) for producing polyethylene (PE) with in-chain ketones is particularly appealing; however, it still presents significant challenges such as molecular weight modulation (hydrogen response) and chain endgroup control (functional terminal). In this study, we achieved hydrogen-controlled E/CO non-alternating copolymerization using late transition metal catalysts. This process results in linear PEs containing the desired non-alternating in-chain keto groups (1.0-9.3 mol%) and with tunable molecular weights ranging from 43 to 195 kDa. In this reaction, H2 serves as a chain transfer agent, modulating the polymer's molecular weight, forming unique aldehyde endgroups and eliminating usual olefinic endgroups; CO undergoes non-alternating insertion into the PE chain, resulting in a strictly non-alternating structure (> 99%) for the keto-PE. The dispersed incorporation of in-chain keto groups retains bulk properties of PE and makes PE susceptible to photodegradation, which produces significantly lower molecular weight polymers and oligomers with unambiguous vinyl and acetyl terminals.",

        "Abstract": "The complex networks exhibit significant heterogeneity in node connections, resulting in a few nodes playing critical roles in various scenarios, including decision-making, disease control, and population immunity. Therefore, accurately identifying these influential nodes that play crucial roles in networks is very important. Many methods have been proposed in different fields to solve this issue. This paper focuses on the different types of disassortativity existing in networks and innovatively introduces the concept of disassortativity of the node, namely, the inconsistency between the degree of a node and the degrees of its neighboring nodes, and proposes a measure of disassortativity of the node (DoN) by a step function. Furthermore, the paper analyzes and indicates that in many real-world network applications, such as online social networks, the influence of nodes within the network is often associated with disassortativity of the node and the community boundary structure of the network. Thus, the influential metric of node based on disassortativity and community structure (mDC) is proposed. Extensive experiments are conducted in synthetic and real networks, and the performance of the DoN and mDC is validated through network robustness experiments and immune experiment of disease infection. Experimental and analytical results demonstrate that compared to other state-of-the-art centrality measures, the proposed methods (DoN and mDC) exhibits superior identification performance and efficiency, particularly in non-disassortative networks and networks with clear community structures. Furthermore, we find that the DoN and mDC exhibit high stability to network noise and inaccuracies of the network data.",

        "Abstract": "Copper (Cu) was recently demonstrated to play a critical role in cellular physiological and biochemical processes, including energy production and maintenance, antioxidation and enzymatic activity, and signal transduction. Antioxidant 1 (ATOX1), a chaperone of Cu previously named human ATX1 homologue (HAH1), has been found to play an indispensable role in maintaining cellular Cu homeostasis, antioxidative stress, and transcriptional regulation. In the past decade, it has also been found to be involved in a variety of diseases, including numerous neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and metabolic diseases. Recently, increasing evidence has revealed that ATOX1 is involved in the regulation of cell migration, proliferation, autophagy, DNA damage repair (DDR), and death, as well as in organism development and reproduction. This review summarizes recent advances in the research on the diverse physiological and cytological functions of ATOX1 and the underlying mechanisms of its action in human health and diseases. The potential of ATOX1 as a therapeutic target is also discussed. This review aims to pose unanswered questions related to ATOX1 biology and explore the potential use of ATOX1 as a therapeutic target.",

Based on Haiyang-1C/Coastal zone imager (HY-1C/CZI) and Terra/MODIS satellite images, the temporal and spatial distribution of green tides floating in the Yellow Sea during 2019 was extracted. The relationships between the growth rate of the green tides and the environmental factors including sea surface temperature (SST), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), sea surface salinity (SSS), nitrate and phosphate during the green tides' dissipation phase has been detected. Based on the maximum likelihood estimation, a regression model that includes SST, PAR and phosphate was recommended to predict the growth rate of the green tides in the dissipation phase (R",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor. The purpose of this study is to estimate the potential effects and underlying mechanisms of a ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) small-molecule inhibitor on the phenotypic characteristics of GBM cells. The growth, migration, invasion, and stemness of GBM LN229 and T98G cells were evaluated by conducting cell proliferation, colony formation, wound healing, transwell, Ki-67 staining, spheroid formation, and ionizing radiation assays, and the results collectively showed the suppressive effects of USP8 inhibition on GBM cells. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling of GBM cells treated with the USP8 inhibitor deubiquitinase (DUB)-IN-1 revealed significantly altered mRNA expression induced by pharmacological USP8 inhibition, from which we confirmed downregulated Aurora kinase A (AURKA) protein levels using immunoblotting assays. Our findings indicated that the proliferation, invasion, and stemness of LN229 and T98G cells were markedly suppressed by USP8 inhibition. Pharmacological USP8 suppression elicits multiple tumor-inhibitory effects, likely through dysregulating various mRNA expression events, including that of the key cell cycle regulator and oncogenic protein AURKA. Therefore, our observations corroborate the GBM-supportive roles of USP8 and suggest pharmacological USP8 inhibition is a viable therapeutic approach to target GBM. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of action of the USP8 inhibitor DUB-IN-1 on GBM.",

        "Abstract": "Tumor evolution is driven by the progressive acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations that enable uncontrolled growth and expansion to neighboring and distal tissues. The study of phylogenetic relationships between cancer cells provides key insights into these processes. Here, we introduced an evolving lineage-tracing system with a single-cell RNA-seq readout into a mouse model of Kras;Trp53(KP)-driven lung adenocarcinoma and tracked tumor evolution from single-transformed cells to metastatic tumors at unprecedented resolution. We found that the loss of the initial, stable alveolar-type2-like state was accompanied by a transient increase in plasticity. This was followed by the adoption of distinct transcriptional programs that enable rapid expansion and, ultimately, clonal sweep of stable subclones capable of metastasizing. Finally, tumors develop through stereotypical evolutionary trajectories, and perturbing additional tumor suppressors accelerates progression by creating novel trajectories. Our study elucidates the hierarchical nature of tumor evolution and, more broadly, enables in-depth studies of tumor progression.",

Such data often occur in many areas, including epidemiological studies, medical studies, and social sciences. For the problem, a class of semiparametric transformation nonmixture cure models is presented and for estimation, the maximum likelihood estimation procedure is derived. For the implementation of the proposed method, we develop a novel EM algorithm based on a Poisson variable-based augmentation. An extensive simulation study is conducted and suggests that the proposed approach works well in practical situations. Finally the method is applied to an example that motivated this study.",

        "Abstract": "The presence of excessive ROS can cause much harm to the human body and can even cause diseases. Therefore, it is important to detect and remove ROS, but there is no ideal method available for this at present. In this research, using procyanidins, a type of plant extract with strong reducibility, as raw materials, fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) were prepared by a hydrothermal method. The proanthocyanidin-based carbon dots (PCDs) emit a light-green colored light under UV irradiation. The PCDs retain the strong reducibility of procyanidins and are highly water-soluble compared with procyanidins. The PCDs, in addition to having good biocompatibility, also have the superior properties of radical scavenging activity and cell imaging. In in vitro experiments, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH; 100 μM) was reduced by 30% when PCDs were added up to a concentration of 87.5 μg mL",

        "Abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body play an important role in various processes. It is well known that harmful high levels of ROS can cause many problems in living organisms in a variety of ways. One effective way to remove intracellular ROS is to use reducing materials that can enter the cell. Herein, we developed a strong reducing carbon nano-dot from a natural product, lutein, as an initial raw material. This is a hydrothermal synthesis method with the advantages of simplicity, high yield, mild reaction conditions, and environmental friendliness. The prepared carbon dots exhibit bright blue fluorescence, and have good water solubility and biocompatibility. In particular, the carbon dots can easily enter the cell and effectively remove ROS. Therefore, the carbon dots are thought to protect cells from oxidative damage by high levels of ROS.",

        "Abstract": "Metastasis is the main cause of death in cancer patients but remains a poorly understood process. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most lethal and most metastatic cancer types. SCLC cells normally express neuroendocrine and neuronal gene programs but accumulating evidence indicates that these cancer cells become relatively more neuronal and less neuroendocrine as they gain the ability to metastasize. Here we show that mouse and human SCLC cells in culture and in vivo can grow cellular protrusions that resemble axons. The formation of these protrusions is controlled by multiple neuronal factors implicated in axonogenesis, axon guidance, and neuroblast migration. Disruption of these axon-like protrusions impairs cell migration in culture and inhibits metastatic ability in vivo. The co-option of developmental neuronal programs is a novel molecular and cellular mechanism that contributes to the high metastatic ability of SCLC.",

        "Abstract": "Bilayer-type hydrogel composites that respond to multiple stimuli provide a useful approach for manufacturing soft actuators and intelligent sensors. In this study, we propose two types of bilayer hydrogel composites (referred to as \"N\" type and \"D\" type). The \"N\" type and the \"D\" type separately consist of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) bilayer hydrogels, with acrylamide (AM) as the co-monomer. The \"N\" type hydrogel composite exhibits oriented bending as temperature increases or as environmental salt concentration increases. The \"D\" type also presents oriented bending as temperature increases. Additionally, it demonstrates bending and changes color based on the pH of the surrounding solution, since it is doped with an acid-based pH-indicator. In a demonstration, we present several straight rods composed of a mixture of \"N\" and \"D\" type hydrogel composites that are able to morph into the letters \"SOS\" under environmental changes (temperature or pH). This can be used as a visual environmental indicator, or as an alarm. Furthermore, we show structures composed of a mixture of \"N\" and \"D\" composites imitating the flexible motions of a ballet dancer or a Tai Chi master. These mixed bilayer polymer composites may be used for applications in soft robotics, biomimetic devices, and environmental sensors.",

        "Abstract": "The extent to which early events shape tumor evolution is largely uncharacterized, even though a better understanding of these early events may help identify key vulnerabilities in advanced tumors. Here, using genetically defined mouse models of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), we uncovered distinct metastatic programs attributable to the cell type of origin. In one model, tumors gain metastatic ability through amplification of the transcription factor NFIB and a widespread increase in chromatin accessibility, whereas in the other model, tumors become metastatic in the absence of NFIB-driven chromatin alterations. Gene-expression and chromatin accessibility analyses identify distinct mechanisms as well as markers predictive of metastatic progression in both groups. Underlying the difference between the two programs was the cell type of origin of the tumors, with NFIB-independent metastases arising from mature neuroendocrine cells. Our findings underscore the importance of the identity of cell type of origin in influencing tumor evolution and metastatic mechanisms.",

We characterize the trajectory of the actuator and the force exerted by it, as we vary the material used for fabrication, the number of chambers, and the size of the actuator. We demonstrate two applications of this actuator: to deliver fluid while stirring (by replacing the central rod with a needle) and for locomotion that mimics a reptilian gait (by combining four actuators together).",

        "Abstract": "Phenotype-based small-molecule screening is a powerful method to identify molecules that regulate cellular functions. However, such screens are generally performed in vitro under conditions that do not necessarily model complex physiological conditions or disease states. Here, we use molecular cell barcoding to enable direct in vivo phenotypic screening of small-molecule libraries. The multiplexed nature of this approach allows rapid in vivo analysis of hundreds to thousands of compounds. Using this platform, we screened >700 covalent inhibitors directed toward hydrolases for their effect on pancreatic cancer metastatic seeding. We identified multiple hits and confirmed the relevant target of one compound as the lipase ABHD6. Pharmacological and genetic studies confirmed the role of this enzyme as a regulator of metastatic fitness. Our results highlight the applicability of this multiplexed screening platform for investigating complex processes in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Metastases are the main cause of cancer deaths, but the mechanisms underlying metastatic progression remain poorly understood. We isolated pure populations of cancer cells from primary tumors and metastases from a genetically engineered mouse model of human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to investigate the mechanisms that drive the metastatic spread of this lethal cancer. Genome-wide characterization of chromatin accessibility revealed the opening of large numbers of distal regulatory elements across the genome during metastatic progression. These changes correlate with copy number amplification of the Nfib locus, and differentially accessible sites were highly enriched for Nfib transcription factor binding sites. Nfib is necessary and sufficient to increase chromatin accessibility at a large subset of the intergenic regions. Nfib promotes pro-metastatic neuronal gene expression programs and drives the metastatic ability of SCLC cells. The identification of widespread chromatin changes during SCLC progression reveals an unexpected global reprogramming during metastatic progression.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes several noncontact methods of orienting objects in 3D space using Magnetic Levitation (MagLev). The methods use two permanent magnets arranged coaxially with like poles facing and a container containing a paramagnetic liquid in which the objects are suspended. Absent external forcing, objects levitating in the device adopt predictable static orientations; the orientation depends on the shape and distribution of mass within the objects. The orientation of objects of uniform density in the MagLev device shows a sharp geometry-dependent transition: an analytical theory rationalizes this transition and predicts the orientation of objects in the MagLev device. Manipulation of the orientation of the levitating objects in space is achieved in two ways: (i) by rotating and/or translating the MagLev device while the objects are suspended in the paramagnetic solution between the magnets; (ii) by moving a small external magnet close to the levitating objects while keeping the device stationary. Unlike mechanical agitation or robotic selection, orienting using MagLev is possible for objects having a range of different physical characteristics (e.g., different shapes, sizes, and mechanical properties from hard polymers to gels and fluids). MagLev thus has the potential to be useful for sorting and positioning components in 3D space, orienting objects for assembly, constructing noncontact devices, and assembling objects composed of soft materials such as hydrogels, elastomers, and jammed granular media.",

        "Abstract": "We show that the solid-solid friction between bulk chiral molecular solids can depend on the relative chirality of the two materials. In menthol and 1-phenyl-1-butanol, heterochiral friction is smaller than homochiral friction, while in ibuprofen, heterochiral friction is larger. Chiral asymmetries in the coefficient of sliding friction vary with temperature and can be as large as 30%. In the three compounds tested, the sign of the difference between heterochiral and homochiral friction correlated with the sign of the difference in melting point between racemate (compound or conglomerate) and pure enantiomer. Menthol and ibuprofen each form a stable racemic compound, while 1-phenyl-1-butanol forms a racemic conglomerate. Thus, a difference between heterochiral and homochiral friction does not require the formation of a stable interfacial racemic compound. Measurements of chirality-dependent friction provide a unique means to distinguish the role of short-range intermolecular forces from all other sources of dissipation in the friction of bulk molecular solids.",

        "Abstract": "Despite its clinical importance, very little is known about the natural history and molecular underpinnings of lung cancer dissemination and metastasis. Here, we used a genetically engineered mouse model of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma in which cancer cells are fluorescently marked to determine whether dissemination is an inherent ability or a major acquired phenotype during lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. We find very little evidence for dissemination from oncogenic KRAS-driven hyperplasias or most adenocarcinomas. p53 loss is insufficient to drive dissemination but rather enables rare cancer cells in a small fraction of primary adenocarcinomas to gain alterations that drive dissemination. Molecular characterization of disseminated tumor cells indicates that downregulation of the transcription factor Nkx2-1 precedes dissemination. Finally, we show that metastatic primary tumors possess a highly proliferative subpopulation of cells with characteristics matching those of disseminating cells. We propose that dissemination is a major hurdle during the natural course of lung adenocarcinoma metastasis.",

        "Abstract": "The MiniChromosome Maintenance 2-7 (MCM2-7) complex provides essential replicative helicase function. Insufficient MCMs impair the cell cycle and cause genomic instability (GIN), leading to cancer and developmental defects in mice. Remarkably, depletion or mutation of one Mcm can decrease all Mcm levels. Here, we use mice and cells bearing a GIN-causing hypomophic allele of Mcm4 (Chaos3), in conjunction with disruption alleles of other Mcms, to reveal two new mechanisms that regulate MCM protein levels and pre-RC formation. First, the Mcm4(Chaos3) allele, which disrupts MCM4:MCM6 interaction, triggers a Dicer1 and Drosha-dependent ≈ 40% reduction in Mcm2-7 mRNAs. The decreases in Mcm mRNAs coincide with up-regulation of the miR-34 family of microRNAs, which is known to be Trp53-regulated and target Mcms. Second, MCM3 acts as a negative regulator of the MCM2-7 helicase in vivo by complexing with MCM5 in a manner dependent upon a nuclear-export signal-like domain, blocking the recruitment of MCMs onto chromatin. Therefore, the stoichiometry of MCM components and their localization is controlled post-transcriptionally at both the mRNA and protein levels. Alterations to these pathways cause significant defects in cell growth reflected by disease phenotypes in mice.",

We derive expression for the correlation free energy of electrostatic attraction of the rods within the random phase approximation. In this theory, we explicitly take into account positions of charged groups on the chains and examine both charge and polymer concentration fluctuations. The correlation free energies and the osmotic pressures are calculated for isotropic and completely ordered nematic phase. The results of the discrete model are compared with results of a continuous model. The discrete model gives rise to a stronger attraction between the charged groups both in the isotropic and nematic phases and to a stronger orienting action of the electrostatic forces.",
