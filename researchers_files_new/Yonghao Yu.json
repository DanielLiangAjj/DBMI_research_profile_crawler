        "Abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a prevalent form of intermittent chronic pain, affecting approximately 7-10% of the global population. However, the current clinical administration methods, such as injection and oral administration, are mostly one-time administration, which cannot achieve accurate control of pain degree and drug dose. Herein, we developed near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive microneedle patches (MNPs) to spatiotemporally control the drug dose released to treat neuropathic pain according to the onset state. The mechanism of action utilizes upconversion nanoparticles to convert NIR light into visible and ultraviolet light. This conversion triggers the rapid rotation of the azobenzene molecular motor in the mesoporous material, enabling the on-demand controlled release of a drug dose. Additionally, MNs are used to overcome the barrier of the stratum corneum in a minimally invasive and painless manner, effectively promoting the transdermal penetration of drug molecules. The effectiveness of these patches has been demonstrated through significant results. Upon exposure to NIR light for five consecutive cycles, with each cycle lasting 30 s, the patches achieved a precise release of 318 μg of medication. In a mouse model, maximum pain relief was observed within 1 h of one cycle of NIR light exposure, with the effects lasting up to 6 h. The same level of precise treatment efficacy was maintained for subsequent pain episodes with similar light exposure. The NIR-controlled drugs precision-released MNPs provide a novel paradigm for the treatment of intermittent neuropathic pain.",

        "Title": "Preoperative recovery sleep ameliorates postoperative cognitive dysfunction aggravated by sleep fragmentation in aged mice by enhancing EEG delta-wave activity and LFP theta oscillation in hippocampal CA1.",
        "Abstract": "Sleep fragmentation (SF) is a common sleep problem experienced during the perioperative period by older adults, and is associated with postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Increasing evidence indicates that delta-wave activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is involved in sleep-dependent memory consolidation and that hippocampal theta oscillations are related to spatial exploratory memory. Recovery sleep (RS), a self-regulated state of sleep homeostasis, enhances delta-wave power and memory performance in sleep-deprived older mice. However, it remains unclear whether RS therapy has a positive effect on cognitive changes following SF in older mouse models. Therefore, this study aimed to explore whether preoperative RS can alleviate cognitive deficits in aged mice with SF. A model of preoperative 24-h SF combined with exploratory laparotomy-induced POCD was established in 18-month-old mice. Aged mice were treated with preoperative 6-h RS following SF and postoperative 6-h RS following surgery, respectively. The changes in hippocampus-dependent cognitive function were investigated using behavioral tests, electroencephalography (EEG), local field potential (LFP), magnetic resonance imaging, and neuromorphology. Mice that underwent 24-h SF combined with surgery exhibited severe spatial memory impairment; impaired cognitive performance could be alleviated by preoperative RS treatment. In addition, preoperative RS increased NREM sleep; enhanced EEG delta-wave activity and LFP theta oscillation in the hippocampal CA1; and improved hippocampal perfusion, microstructural integrity, and neuronal damage. Taken together, these results provide evidence that preoperative RS may ameliorate the severity of POCD aggravated by SF by enhancing delta slow-wave activity and hippocampal theta oscillation, and by ameliorating the reduction in regional cerebral blood flow and white matter microstructure integrity in the hippocampus.",

        "Abstract": "REPAT (response to pathogen) is an immune-associated gene family that plays important roles in insect immune response to pathogens. Although nine REPAT genes have been identified in Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) currently, their functions and mechanisms in the immune response to pathogens still remain unclear. Therefore, SfREPAT38, a pathogen response gene (REPAT) of S. frugiperda, was characterised and its function was analysed. The results showed that SfREPAT38 contains a signal peptide and a transcription activator MBF2 (multi-protein bridging factor 2) domain. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that SfREPAT38 was highly expressed in the sixth-instar larvae (L6) and was the highest in expression in the midgut of L6. We found that the expression of SfREPAT38 could be activated by challenge with four microbial pathogens (Bacillus thuringiensis, Metarhizium anisopliae, Spodoptera exigua nuclearpolyhedrosis and Escherichia coli), except 12 h after E. coli infection. Furthermore, the SfREPAT38 expression levels significantly decreased at 24, 48 and 72 h after SfREPAT38 dsRNA injection or feeding. Feeding with SfREPAT38 dsRNA significantly decreased the weight gain of S. frugiperda, and continuous feeding led to the death of S. frugiperda larvae from the fourth day. Moreover, SfREPAT38 dsRNA injection resulted in a significant decrease of weight gain on the fifth day. Silencing SfREPAT38 gene down-regulated the expression levels of immune genes belonging to the Toll pathway, including SPZ, Myd88, DIF, Cactus, Pell and Toll18W. After treatment with SfREPAT38 dsRNA, S. frugiperda became extremely sensitive to the B. thuringiensis infection, and the survival rate dramatically increased, with 100% mortality by the eighth day. The weight of S. frugiperda larvae was also significantly lower than that of the control groups from the second day onwards. In addition, the genes involved in the Toll signalling pathway and a few antibacterial peptide related genes were down-regulated after treatment. These results showed that SfREPAT38 is involved in the immune response of S. frugiperda larvae through mediating Toll signalling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have pointed to PARP1 trapping as a key determinant of the anticancer effects of PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi). We identified RNF114, as a PARylation-dependent, E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in DNA damage response. Upon sensing genotoxicity, RNF114 was recruited, in a PAR-dependent manner, to DNA lesions, where it targeted PARP1 for degradation. The blockade of this pathway interfered with the removal of PARP1 from DNA lesions, leading to profound PARP1 trapping. We showed that a natural product, nimbolide, inhibited the E3 ligase activity of RNF114 and thus caused PARP1 trapping. However, unlike conventional PARPi, nimbolide treatment induced the trapping of both PARP1 and PARylation-dependent DNA repair factors. Nimbolide showed synthetic lethality with ",

        "Title": "Effects of the PI3K/Akt/HO-1 pathway on autophagy in a sepsis-induced acute lung injury mouse model.",
        "Abstract": "Sepsis-induced lung injury is an acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency caused by systemic infectious factors that results in alveolar epithelial cell and capillary endothelial cell injury, diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema, and alveolar edema. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is usually associated with inflammation and has anti-inflammatory effects. Autophagy is a degradation pathway that eliminates cellular metabolic waste and plays an important protective role during stress. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/ protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway plays a key role in mediating cellular responses to inflammatory reactions. Therefore, we hypothesized that HO-1 is associated with autophagy and regulated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in mice with sepsis-induced lung injury. Sepsis-induced lung injury was induced in mice using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Hemin or Sn-protoporphyrin IX (SnPP) was administered via intraperitoneal injection before surgery. Survival rates were observed during days 1-7 after the surgery; lung histology was discerned 24 h after the surgery; pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors in plasma and lung tissue were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); HO-1, Beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B)-II, p62 and lysosome associated membrane protein (LAMP)2 protein expression levels were measured 24 h after the surgery; HO-1 and LC3B-II protein expression levels were observed using immunofluorescence 24 h after the surgery; and autophagosomes were detected using electron microscopy 24 h after the surgery. Furthermore, when PI3K inhibitors LY294002, PI3K activators Recilisib and hemin were administered before the surgery, Akt, p-Akt, HO-1, and LC3-II levels were measured 24 h post-surgery. We found that HO-1 overexpression increased the survival rate and inhibited sepsis-induced lung injury. HO-1 overexpression attenuated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10, HO-1) overexpression. Moreover, HO-1 overexpression was also associated with increased expression of Beclin-1, LC3B-II and LAMP2 protein expression; decreased p62 protein expression; and significantly increased autophagosome formation. The results for HO-1-downregulated mice contrasted with those mentioned above. LY294002 inhibited p-Akt/Akt, HO-1, and LC3B-II protein expression; and hemin reversed the inhibitory effect of LY294002. The protective effect of HO-1 was involved in the mediation of autophagy, which may be regulated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway during sepsis-induced lung injury in mice.",

SF is characterized by sleep interruption, increased number of awakenings and sleep structure destruction, similar to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Research shows that sleep interruption can change neurotransmitter metabolism and structural connectivity in sleep and cognitive brain regions, of which the medial septum and hippocampal CA1 are key brain regions connecting sleep and cognitive processes. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a non-invasive method for the evaluation of neurometabolic abnormalities. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) realizes the observation of structural integrity and connectivity of brain regions of interest ",

        "Abstract": "Remimazolam tosilate (RT) is a new short-acting γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors agonist. However, its optimal use mode and dosage still remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of RT and propofol in gastroscopy. This was a prospective, single-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study. All eligible 256 patients were randomized into the following 3 groups. Patients were anesthetized with propofol (Group P), RT (Group R) or the combination of RT and propofol (Group RP). The primary efficacy endpoints were: body movement score; satisfaction of gastroscopy doctors; success rate of sedation and effects on sleep status. Sedation induction time, time to be fully alert and adverse events were also recorded. The probability of complete immobility was lower in group R (33.73%) than in group P (86.67%) and RP (83.13%). The rate of doctors' satisfaction was much lower in group R (28.92%) than in group P (77.78%) and RP (72.29%). The success rate of sedation and sleep outcome score has no difference in the three groups. The time to adequate sedation was longer in group RP (77.27 ± 18.63 s) than in group P (64.47 ± 24.36 s), but much shorter than that in group R (102.84 ± 46.43s). The time to be fully alert was shorter in group R (6.30 ± 1.52 min) and RP (6.54 ± 1.13 min) than in group P (7.87 ± 1.08 min). The proportion of sedative hypotension was significantly higher in group P (41.11%) than in group R (1.20%) and group RP (3.61%) (",

        "Abstract": "Background: It is unknown whether early renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation strategy in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with both acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis with or without renal failure is clinically beneficial. Patients and methods: A total of 818 patients with both ARDS and sepsis admitted to the ICU of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital were included in the analysis. Early RRT was defined as initiating the RRT strategy within 24 h of admission. The relationship between early RRT and clinical outcomes, including primary (30-day mortality) and secondary (90-day mortality, serum creatinine, Pa o2 /Fi o2 , duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, cumulative fluid output, and cumulative fluid balance) outcomes, was compared using propensity score matching (PSM). Results: A total of 277 patients (33.9% of the total population) underwent an early RRT initiation strategy before PSM. After PSM, a cohort of 147 patients with early RRT and 147 patients without early RRT with matched baseline characteristics (including serum creatinine at admission) were constructed. Early RRT was not significantly associated with 30- (hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.85; P = 0.258) or 90-day mortality (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.91-1.87, P = 0.150). At each time point within 72 h after admission, there was no significant difference in serum creatinine, Pa o2 /Fi o2 and duration of mechanical ventilation between the early and the no early RRT groups. Early RRT significantly increased total output at all time points within 72 h of admission and reached a statistically significant negative fluid balance at 48 h. Conclusions: Early RRT initiation strategies had no statistically significant survival benefit in ICU patients with both ARDS and sepsis, with or without renal failure, nor did they significantly improve serum creatinine and oxygenation or shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation. The use and timing of RRT in such patients should be thoroughly investigated.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of PARP1 as a therapeutic target for BRCA1/2-deficient cells has led to a paradigm shift for the treatment of human malignancies with BRCA1/2 mutations. However, our understanding of the mechanism of action of PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) is still evolving. It is being increasingly appreciated that the immunomodulatory function of PARPi is a critical contributor of the anti-tumor effects of these compounds. Here, we identify a novel cell death effector pathway for PARPi where PARPi induces inflammatory pyroptosis that is mediated by caspase 3-dependent cleavage of GSDME. Caspase 3 is activated upon PARPi treatment which directly cleaves GSDME and, subsequently induces pyroptosis. Genetic and pharmacological experiments show that the presence of the PARP1 protein with uncompromised DNA binding capability is required for PARPi-induced pyroptosis, suggesting that PARP1 trapping is a key driver of this phenomenon. Importantly, we show that PARPi-induced GSDME cleavage and pyroptosis occurred only in the BRCA1-deficient cells, but not in those reconstituted with BRCA1 wild-type (WT). These findings suggest that pyroptosis could be a novel aspect of the immunomodulatory function of PARPi. Our studies could also offer new insights to the potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to achieve better anti-tumor effects of PARPi for BRCA-deficient tumors with low GSDME expression.",

        "Abstract": "Sevoflurane is the most commonly used general anesthetic in pediatric surgery, but it has the potential to be neurotoxic. Previous research found that long-term or multiple sevoflurane exposures could cause cognitive deficits in newborn mice but not adult mice, whereas short-term or single inhalations had little effect on cognitive function at both ages. The mechanisms behind these effects, however, are unclear.",

        "Abstract": "Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the major causes of death and disability worldwide, and effective diagnosis and treatment methods are lacking. RNA methylation, a common epigenetic modification, plays an important role in disease progression. However, little is known about the role of RNA methylation modification in the regulation of IS. The aim of this study was to investigate RNA methylation modification patterns and immune infiltration characteristics in IS through bioinformatics analysis. We downloaded gene expression profiles of control and IS model rat brain tissues from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. IS profiles were divided into two subtypes based on RNA methylation regulators, and functional enrichment analyses were conducted to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the subtypes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to explore co-expression modules and genes based on DEGs. The IS clinical diagnosis model was successfully constructed and four IS characteristic genes (",

        "Abstract": "Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a cognitive impairment caused by sepsis, associated with increased morbidity and death. And acetaminophen (APAP) is a promising therapeutic medicine for SAE treatment. This research was designed to determine whether APAP alleviates SAE by attenuating ferroptosis and mediating the glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) pathway. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) approach was used to establish septic mouse models. The survival rates for 7 days were determined. The Morris water maze (MWM) was utilized to assess cognitive function. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining identified histopathologic alterations in hippocampal tissue. Mitochondrial damage was discovered in hippocampal tissue using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The reactive oxygen (ROS) levels in hippocampal tissue were measured using commercial assays. Septic cell models were produced using HT22 cells grown with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ROS were quantified using immunofluorescence. Ferroptosis-related protein expression levels in hippocampal tissue and HT22 cells were measured using western blotting. To evaluate the iron content of hippocampal tissue and HT22 cells, commercial kits were employed. According to the findings, APAP improved survival rates, lowered hippocampal and mitochondrial damage, and improve cognitive impairment. In both animal and cell studies, APAP reduced iron content, ROS, glutamate antiporter (xCT), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) levels but increased GPX4 expression. However, RSL3, a GPX4 inhibitor that acts as a ferroptosis activator, decreased the protective properties of APAP ",

        "Abstract": "E-bike, characterized as a low-carbon and health-beneficial active travel mode, is gradually becoming popular in China. Although built environment factors are considered to be key parameters that can facilitate or hinder active transportation, such as cycling or walking, few studies have explored the impact of built environment on e-bikes. To fill this gap, this study was the first to explore the relationship between e-bike usage and built environment factors based on population level travel survey in central Jinan, China. Both macro and micro levels of built environment were measured using multi-source data. We employed ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models to explore the aggregation patterns of e-bike trips. Besides, the local Moran's I was employed to classify the aggregation patterns of e-bike trips into four types. The results from OLS model showed that eye-level greenery, building floor area, road density and public service POI were positive significantly related to e-bike trips, while open sky index and NDVI had negative association with e-bike trips. The usage of GWR model provided more subtle results, which revealed significant spatial heterogeneity on the impacts of different built environment parameters. Road density and public service POI posed positive effects on e-bike travel while NDVI and open sky index were found mainly pose negative impacts on e-bike travel. Moreover, we found similar coefficient distribution patterns of eye-level greenery, building floor area and distance to bus stop. Therefore, tailored planning interventions and policies can be developed to facilitate e-bike travel and promote individual's health level.",

        "Abstract": "General anesthesia has been widely utilized since the 1840s, but its underlying neural circuits remain to be completely understood. Since both general anesthesia and sleep are reversible losses of consciousness, studies on the neural-circuit mechanisms affected by general anesthesia have mainly focused on the neural nuclei or the pathways known to regulate sleep. Three advanced technologies commonly used in neuroscience, in vivo calcium imaging, chemogenetics, and optogenetics, are used to record and modulate the activity of specific neurons or neural circuits in the brain areas of interest. Recently, they have successfully been used to study the neural nuclei and pathways of general anesthesia. This article reviews these three techniques and their applications in the brain nuclei or pathways affected by general anesthesia, to serve as a reference for further and more accurate exploration of other neural circuits under general anesthesia and to contribute to other research fields in the future.",

In this study, we demonstrated the role of VD in alleviating the cognitive dysfunction in aged mice caused by sevoflurane anesthesia. Forty female C57BL/6 mice aged 12 months were selected for the experiment. VD (-) and VD (+) mouse models and sevoflurane anesthesia models were established. Mice were randomly divided into normal elderly group (NC group), normal aged mice + sevoflurane anesthesia treatment group (NS group), aged VD (-) mice + sevoflurane anesthesia treatment group [VD (-) group], and aged VD (+) + sevoflurane anesthesia treatment group [VD (+) group]. To compare the emergence time after sevoflurane anesthesia in aged mice with different levels of VD and to test the cognitive function of four groups through the water maze. Inflammatory factor expression and cholinergic activity in hippocampus tissue of all mice were measured at the end of behavioral tests. These data show that, low levels of VD aggravated the delayed emergence and cognitive dysfunction in aged mice caused by sevoflurane anesthesia, while higher levels of VD mitigated this impairment by enhancing cholinergic activity and reducing inflammatory factor expression in the hippocampus.",

Activation of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been linked to the development of inflammatory and neuropathic pain.

However, there is no convincing evidence that sevoflurane directly causes the development of neurotoxicity. miR-424 has the potential to regulate the neurotoxicity caused by isoflurane anesthesia, and it has a complementary sequence with the 3'UTR region of TLR4.

        "Abstract": "Although targeted MAPK pathway inhibition has achieved remarkable patient responses in many cancers, the development of resistance has remained a critical challenge. Adaptive tumor response underlies the drug resistance. Furthermore, such bypass mechanisms often lead to the activation of many pro-survival kinases, which complicates the rational design of combination therapies. Here, we performed global tyrosine phosphoproteomic (pTyr) analyses and demonstrated that targeted MAPK signaling inhibition in melanoma leads to a profound remodeling of the pTyr proteome. Intriguingly, altered cholesterol metabolism might drive, in a coordinated fashion, the activation of these kinases. Indeed, we found an accumulation of intracellular cholesterol in melanoma cells (with BRAF",

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) phosphorylation in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) plays a pronociceptive role in neuropathic pain. The contribution of the P2Y1 purinergic receptor (P2Y1R) in DRG to pain hypersensitivity derived from various origins and P2Y1R upregulation-induced NMDAR activation in neurons have also been uncovered.

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Perioperative neuro-cognitive disorders (PND) are preoperative and postoperative complications of multiple nervous systems, typically manifested as decreased memory and learning ability after surgery. It was used to replace the original definition of postoperative cognitive dysfunctions (POCD) from 2018. Our previous studies have shown that sevoflurane inhalation can lead to cognitive dysfunction in Sprague-Dawley rats, but the specific mechanism is still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=6): the SD group was given 24-h acute sleep deprivation; Sevoflurane was inhaled for 2 h in the Sevo group. Two mL propofol was injected into the tail vein of rats in the Prop group. The rats in the SD+Sevo group and SD+Prop group were deprived of sleep before intervention in the same way as before. RESULTS We noted significant behavioral changes in rats treated with SIK3 inhibitors or tau phosphorylation agonists before propofol injection or sevoflurane inhalation, with associated protein levels and dendritic spine density documented. Sevoflurane anesthesia-induced cognitive impairment following acute sleep deprivation was more pronounced than sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairment alone and resulted in increased brain SIK3 levels, increased phosphorylation of total tau and tau, and decreased acetylation modifications. After using propofol, the cognitive function returned to baseline levels with a series of reversals of cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that sevoflurane inhalation via the SIK3 pathway aggravates cognitive impairment after acute sleep deprivation and that propofol anesthesia reverses the effects of sleep deprivation by affecting modifications of tau protein.",

        "Abstract": "Patients who undergo surgery of femur fracture suffer the excruciating pain. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a unique α2-adrenergic receptor agonist with sedative and analgesic properties, whose efficacy and safety are still unclear for surgery of femur fracture. Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of addition of DEX to general or local anesthesia in surgery of femur fracture were searched from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database. Patients who received DEX infusion had a significant longer time to rescue analgesia compared with those without DEX coadministration. DEX treatment seemed to reduce the visual analog score; however, the significance did not reach any statistical difference. DEX as an analgesic adjuvant did not reduce the onset of sensory block time, shorten the time to achieve maximum sensory block level, and provide a longer duration of sensory block. The difference in mean sedation scores between 2 groups was not statistically significant. As for adverse effects, DEX therapy significantly increased the rate of hypotension. In conclusion, dexmedetomidine as a local anesthetic adjuvant in femur fracture surgery had a longer duration of rescue analgesia. However, the incidence of hypotension was markedly increased in these patients. It was worth noting that the evidence was of low to moderate quality.",

        "Abstract": "Remifentanil is widely used to control intraoperative pain. However, its analgesic effect is limited by the generation of postoperative hyperalgesia. In this study, we investigated whether the impairment of transmembrane protein 16C (TMEM16C)/Slack is required for α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic receptor (AMPAR) activation in remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia. Remifentanil anesthesia reduced the paw withdrawal threshold from 2 h to 48 h postoperatively, with a decrease in the expression of TMEM16C and Slack in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord. Knockdown of TMEM16C in the DRG reduced the expression of Slack and elevated the basal peripheral sensitivity and AMPAR expression and function. Overexpression of TMEM16C in the DRG impaired remifentanil-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and behavioral hyperalgesia. AMPAR-mediated current and neuronal excitability were downregulated by TMEM16C overexpression in the spinal cord. Taken together, these findings suggest that TMEM16C/Slack regulation of excitatory synaptic plasticity via GluA1-containing AMPARs is critical in the pathogenesis of remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia in rats.",

        "Abstract": "The development and maintenance of morphine tolerance showed association with neuroinflammation and dysfunction of central glutamatergic system (such as nitration of glutamate transporter). Recent evidence indicated that hydrogen could reduce the levels of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, but its role in morphine tolerance has not been studied. The rats were intrathecally administered with morphine (10 μg/10 μL each time, twice/day for 5 days). Hydrogen enriched saline (HS) or saline was given intraperitoneally at 1, 3 and 10 mL/kg for 10 min before each dose of morphine administration. The tail-flick latency, mechanical threshold and thermal latency were assessed one day (baseline) before and daily for up to 5 days during morphine injection. The pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6)] (by western blotting), astrocyte activation (by immunofluorescence and western blotting), and nitration of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and glutamine synthetase (GS) (by immunoprecipitation), membrane and total expression of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor NR1 and NR2B subunits were carried out in the spinal dorsal horns. Chronic morphine administration induced antinociceptive tolerance, and together led to increased TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 expression, astrocyte activation, GLT-1 and GS nitration, increased membrane and total NR1, NR2B expression. Injection of HS attenuated morphine tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression, inhibited astrocyte activation, decreased GLT-1 and GS nitration, and inhibited membrane trafficking of NMDA receptor. Our result showed that hydrogen pretreatment prevented morphine tolerance by reducing neuroinflammation, GLT-1, GS nitration, NMDA receptor trafficking in the spinal dorsal horn. Pretreatment with hydrogen might be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for the prevention of morphine tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "Children with multiple exposures to anesthesia and surgery may be more likely to develop the learning disability. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was reported to reduce the multiple sevoflurane treatment-induced cognitive deficiency in 6-day-old young mice. However, its specific mechanisms have not yet been found. This research aimed to reveal the role of ApoE in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficiency caused by sevoflurane anesthesia and the protective mechanism of CoQ10 in a multiple sevoflurane treatment model of young mice. The mice were randomly divided into four groups: Control + corn oil, Sevoflurane + corn oil, Control + CoQ10, and Sevoflurane + CoQ10. Sevoflurane group mice were anesthetized with 3% sevoflurane and 60% oxygen 2 hr a day for 3 days, while control group mice received only 60% oxygen. Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg CoQ10 or the same volume of corn oil 30 min before the inhalation of oxygen or sevoflurane for 3 days. Mice received sevoflurane anesthesia or control treatment from the 6th to 8th day after birth. The cortex and hippocampus were harvested on the 8th day. The ATP, MMP, ApoE mRNA, total ApoE, ApoE fragments, Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, Tau5, AT8, and PHF levels were detected. The Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed from P30 to p36 after anesthesia or control treatment. The results indicated that the injection of CoQ10 ahead of sevoflurane treatment could reverse the anesthesia-induced energy deficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction, ApoE, and its fragments expression, Aβ1-42 generation, Tau phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment in young mice. These data reveal that the ApoE and its fragments enhancement may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficiency caused by sevoflurane anesthesia. CoQ10 could reduce ApoE expression by improving energy replenishment and mitochondrial functions, thereby alleviating sevoflurane-induced brain damage and cognitive impairment.",

        "Abstract": "Sevoflurane may exert neurotoxic effects on the developing brain. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has been reported to reduce sevoflurane anesthesia‑induced cognitive deficiency in 6‑day‑old mice. However, its specific mechanisms remain unknown. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been reported to lead to the initiation of neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may serve an important role in anesthesia‑induced neurotoxicity. The present study aimed to reveal the role of ApoE in the pathogenesis of tau protein hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation enhancement caused by sevoflurane anesthesia, as well as the protective mechanism of CoQ10 in an anesthetic sevoflurane treatment model of primary mouse hippocampal neurons. For that purpose, the neurons were randomly assigned to the following groups: i) Control; ii) sevoflurane; iii) control+corn oil; iv) sevoflurane+corn oil; v) control+CoQ10; and vi) control+CoQ10. CoQ10 or corn oil alone was added to the medium on day 4 of neuron culture. The neurons in the sevoflurane group were treated with 21% O2, 5% CO2 and 4.1% sevoflurane for 4 h, whereas the control group only with 21% O2 and 5% CO2 on day 5. Samples were collected immediately after anesthesia or control treatment. ATP, superoxidase dismutase (SOD)1, ApoE mRNA, total ApoE, full‑length ApoE, ApoE fragments, Tau5, Tau‑PS202/PT205 (AT8), Tau‑PSer396/404 (PHF1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑6 and IL‑1β levels were measured with ELISA, quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The results of the present study indicated that sevoflurane anesthesia significantly decreased the ATP and SOD levels, but increased ApoE mRNA, total ApoE protein, full‑length ApoE, ApoE fragments, phosphorylated tau (AT8 and PHF1) and neuroinflammatory factor (TNF‑α, IL‑6 and IL‑1β) expression levels compared with those in the control group. The use of CoQ10 reversed the expression of these factors. These results suggested that sevoflurane treatment damaged mouse hippocampal neurons, which may be associated with the expression of ApoE and its toxic fragments. CoQ10 improved energy replenishment and inhibited oxidative stress, which may lead to a decrease in ApoE and phosphorylated tau protein expression, thus mitigating the sevoflurane‑induced neuroinflammation in mouse hippocampal neurons.",

        "Abstract": "A powerful means to understand the cellular function of corrupt oncogenic signaling programs requires perturbing the system and monitoring the downstream consequences. Here, using a unique pair of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)/normal lung epithelial patient-derived cell lines (HCC4017/HBEC30KT), we systematically interrogated the remodeling of the NSCLC proteome upon treatment with 35 chemical perturbagens targeting a diverse array of mechanistic classes. HCC4017 and HBEC30KT cells differ significantly in their proteomic response to the same compound treatment. Using protein covariance analyses, we identified a large number of functional protein networks. For example, we found that a poorly studied protein, C5orf22, is a novel component of the WBP11/PQBP1 splicing complex. Depletion of C5orf22 leads to the aberrant splicing and expression of genes involved in cell growth and immunomodulation. In summary, we show that by systematically measuring the tumor adaptive responses at the proteomic level, an understanding could be generated that provides critical circuit-level biological insights for these pharmacologic perturbagens.",

        "Abstract": "It has previously been demonstrated that hyperglycemia‑induced oxidative stress and inflammation are closely associated with the development of diabetic complications, including diabetic neuropathy. Additionally, mitochondrial ATP‑sensitive potassium (Mito‑K‑ATP) channels play a homeostatic role on blood glucose regulation in organisms. Molecular hydrogen (H2) exhibits anti‑inflammatory, anti‑antioxidative and anti‑apoptotic properties and can be used to treat more than 71 diseases safely. In addition, the diabetes animal models which are set up using streptozotocin (STZ) injection, is a type of high long‑term stability, low animal mortality rate and security method. The aim of the current study was to assess the value of hydrogen‑rich saline (HS) in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) treatment and to determine its associated mechanisms in STZ‑induced diabetic experimental rats. Additionally, the effects of the Mito‑K‑ATP channels, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis on DPN were also evaluated. From week 5 of STZ injections, HS (2.5, 5 and 10 ml/kg) was injected into the rat abdominal cavity every day for a period of 4 weeks. The results of the current study demonstrated that HS significantly reduced behavioral, biochemical and molecular effects caused by DPN. However, 5‑hydroxydecanoate, a selective Mito‑K‑ATP channels general pathway inhibitor, partially eliminated the therapeutic effect of HS on DPN. These results indicated that the use of HS may be a novel strategy to treat DPN by activating the Mito‑K‑ATP pathway and reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis.",

        "Abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a complication after a spinal nerve injury. The inflammasomes are now identified to be responsible for triggering inflammation in neuropathic pain. Autophagy participates in the process of neuropathic pain and can regulate the inflammasome activation in different diseases. Our previous research reported that hydrogen exerted a protective effect against neuropathic pain. Therefore, we focused on the mechanism and role of autophagy and inflammasome, by which hydrogen alleviated the hyperpathia induced by neuropathic pain. The results showed that neuropathic pain stimulated activation of inflammasome NLRP3 and autophagy pathway in the microglial cells of the spinal cord. The inhibition of NLRP3 inhibited the hyperpathia induced by spinal nerve litigation surgery. The absence of autophagy aggravated the inflammasome activity and hyperpathia. Hydrogen promoted autophagy related protein expression, inhibited the inflammasome NLRP3 pathway activation, and relieved the hyperpathia induced by neuropathic pain. Hydrogen treatment could alleviate hyperpathia by autophagy-mediated NLRP3 inactivation.",

        "Abstract": "PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) are known to kill tumor cells via two mechanisms (PARP1 catalytic inhibition and PARP1 trapping). The relative contribution of these two pathways in mediating the cytotoxicity of PARPi, however, is not well understood. Here we designed a series of small molecule PARP degraders. Treatment with one such compound iRucaparib-AP6 results in highly efficient and specific PARP1 degradation. iRucaparib-AP6 blocks the enzymatic activity of PARP1 in vitro, and PARP1-mediated poly-ADP-ribosylation signaling in intact cells. This strategy mimics PARP1 genetic depletion, which enables the pharmacological decoupling of PARP1 inhibition from PARP1 trapping. Finally, by depleting PARP1, iRucaparib-AP6 protects muscle cells and primary cardiomyocytes from DNA-damage-induced energy crisis and cell death. In summary, these compounds represent 'non-trapping' PARP1 degraders that block both the catalytic activity and scaffolding effects of PARP1, providing an ideal approach for the amelioration of the various pathological conditions caused by PARP1 hyperactivation.",

        "Abstract": "ADP-ribosylation is a protein post-translational modification that is critically involved in a wide array of biological processes connected to cell stress responses. Enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) catalyze the addition of the ADP-ribose units to amino acids with various side chain chemistries. In particular, the PARP family member PARP1 is responsible for the modification of a large number of proteins and is involved in initiation of the DNA damage response, although the mechanisms through which PARP1 functions are still incompletely understood. The analysis of protein ADP-ribosylation is challenging because PARylation is a low-abundance, labile and heterogeneous protein modification. Recently, we developed an integrative proteomic platform for the site-specific analysis of protein ADP-ribosylation on Asp and Glu residues. Herein, we describe the method, and demonstrate its utility in quantitative characterization of the human Asp- and Glu-ADP-ribosylated proteome.",

        "Title": "Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway participated in the protection of hydrogen sulfide on neuropathic pain in rats.",
        "Abstract": "Neuropathic pain is evoked by aberrant sensory processing in the peripheral or central nervous system, which is characterized by persistent pain, tactile allodynia, or hyperalgesia. Neuroinflammation is associated with the initiation and maintenance of persistent pain in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Hydrogen sulfide plays important regulatory roles in different physiological and pathological conditions. Therefore, we investigated the effect of hydrogen sulfide on allodynia, hyperalgesia and cytokine release in rats with neuropathic pain and the related regulatory mechanism. Neuropathic pain was established by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in rats. Nuclear factor erythroid-2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) siRNA, hemin, Sn-protoporphyrin (SnPP)-IX and/or NaHS were administered to rats with neuropathic pain, and the spinal cord was collected to detect the expression of Nrf2, hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κb) and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and high mobility group box (HMGB)-1 by Western blot (WB) analysis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia and the number of paw lifts were measured at different time points after operation. In the present research, neuropathic pain induced Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in the microglial cells of the spinal cord; Nrf2 and HO-1 were necessary to alleviate the hyperalgesia of CCI-induced rats; NaHS mitigated the hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by the CCI operation; and NaHS mitigated the excessive release of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and HMGB1 via the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in the microglial cells of the spinal cord. These results indicated that NaHS exhibited antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects that were associated with the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in the spinal cord of rats with neuropathic pain.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine the protective effect of novel 1,3,5-triazine-procaine derivatives against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Initially, the experiment has been started by the synthesis of procaine, which later got substituted with diverse 1,3,5-triazine derivatives to furnish the final compounds. The target compounds were tested for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitory activity in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The antioxidant activity of most potent compound 9i was investigated using hydroxyl radical, DPPH, and superoxide anion scavenging assay. Compound 9i was further evaluated for protective effect against myocardial I/R injury on the basis numerous parameters, for example, hemodynamic parameters (left ventricular developed pressure [LVDP], ±dp/dtmax, coronary flow [CF], and heart rate [HR]), myocardial enzymes (creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), oxidative stress (super oxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], glutathione [GSH], and glutathione peroxidise [GPx]), histopathology, western blots analysis for B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated x protein (Bax), lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), and NF-κB in cardiac tissues. Compounds showed significant inhibition of NF-ĸB transcriptional activity in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, revealing compound 9i as a most potent derivative. In vitro results showed efficient reduction of reduced hydroxyl radical, DPPH, and superoxide anion by 9i. The level LVDP, ±dp/dtmax, CF, HR, TBARS, SOD, CAT, GSH, GPx, and damaged cardiac histopathology were completely restored to normal in 9i-treated group, as compared to I/R group. In western blot analysis, the expression of Bax, LOX-1, and NF-ĸB was found to be decreased, while the level of Bcl-2 was found to be increased in 9i-treated group. The procaine-1,3,5-triazine derivatives showed significant cardioprotective action via inhibition of NF-ĸB.",

        "Abstract": "Electroacupuncture (EA), a traditional Chinese therapeutic technique, is considered an effective method for treating certain painful neuropathies induced by various neuropathological damage. The current study investigated the effect of EA on intrathecal (IT) morphine‑induced hyperalgesia (MIH) and examined the hypothesis that activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) could enhance the antinociceptive effect of EA on MIH via regulation of the extracellular signal‑regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. Using a rat model of IT MIH, mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated by an electronic von Frey filament and hotplate at baseline (1 day before IT administration) and at days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after IT administration. Rats received IT normal saline, IT morphine or IT morphine + EA at ST36‑GB34. The protein levels of ERK1/2, phosphorylated (p)‑ERK1/2 and CB1 in the spinal cord were assayed by western blotting. Furthermore, the effect of IT injection of the CB1 agonist WIN 55,212‑2 and the CB1 antagonist SR141716 on the antinociceptive effect of EA in rats with MIH was investigated. Nociceptive behavior and ERK1/2, phosphorylated (p)‑ERK1/2 and CB1 protein levels were evaluated as mentioned above. The results revealed that chronic IT injections of morphine induced a significant decrease in mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) accompanied with remarkable upregulation of p‑ERK1/2 in the spinal cord, which could be attenuated by EA at the ST36‑GB34 acupoints. In the rat model of MIH, IT injection of WIN 55,212‑2 combined with EA induced a significant increase in MWT and TWL accompanied with a significant decrease in p‑ERK1/2 and a significant increase in CB1 protein level compared with EA alone, while SR141716 induced the opposite results. The present study suggests that EA alleviates hyperalgesia induced by IT injection of morphine partially through the inhibition of ERK1/2 activation. Activation of the CB1 receptor enhances the antinociceptive effect of EA in rats with MIH partly through the regulation of the spinal CB1‑ERK1/2 signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "The macrophage is an innate immune response cell that plays an important role in the development of sepsis. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a sedation drug, which have anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis effects and can be used on sepsis patients in the ICU. However, its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) is a mitochondrial serine/threonine protein kinase that recognizes damaged mitochondria and leads to mitophagy. This study investigated the effects of DEX on Lipopolysaccharides(LPS)-induced macrophage injury and explained the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that LPS treatment caused mitochondrial damage, mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and PINK1-mediated mitophagy; at the same time, PINK1 has a protective effect on LPS-induced macrophage apoptosis and inflammation by mitophagy that eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria. DEX could promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria characterized by low Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and high reactive oxygen species(ROS), thus exerting a protective effect in LPS treated macrophages, and PINK1 mediated mitophagy is required for this protective effect.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic postoperative pain might be a pivotal component hindering recovery and regains the function after bone fracture and orthopedic surgery. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. AMPA receptor of excitatory synapses is considered due to its critical role in pathologic pain. Chemokine CCL1 related neuroinflammation plays a role in excitatory synaptic transmission and nociceptive transduction. This study examined whether spinal CCL1 is associated with fracture-associated postoperative pain via AMPA receptor. We herein discovered that the tibial fracture with orthopedic surgery initiated and maintained chronic postoperative pain along with spinal up-regulation of CCL1/CCR8 expression and phosphorylation of GluA1-containing AMPA receptor. Central CCL1/CCR8 inhibition impaired mechanical and cold allodynia, and phosphorylated GluA1-containing AMPA receptor in the spinal dorsal horn. Intrathecal injection of GluA1-containing AMPA receptor antagonist NASPM alleviated fracture-related postoperative pain. Also, exogenous CCL1 delivery facilitated acute pain behaviors and spinal phosphorylation of GluA1-containing AMPA receptor in naïve mice, reversing by co-application of NASPM. Our current results indicated that spinal CCL1/CCR8-mediated GluA1-containing AMPA receptor activation is vital in the pathogenesis of fracture associated postoperative pain in mice.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we demonstrated the effects of a high-fiber diet on intestinal lesions, oxidative stress and systemic inflammation in a murine model of endotoxemia. C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to four groups: the control group (CONTROL), which received a commercial normal-fiber rodent diet comprising normal fiber; a CLP group, which received a commercial normal-fiber rodent diet and underwent caecal ligation puncture (CLP); a high-fiber group (HFG), which received a commercial high-fiber rodent diet; and a high fiber + CLP group (HFCLP) which received a commercial high-fiber rodent diet and underwent CLP (30%). The sepsis model was created via CLP after 2 weeks of dietary intervention. Notably, dietary high-fiber supplementation in HFCLP group improved survival rates and reduced bacterial loads, compared with CLP alone. In the HFCLP group, dietary fiber supplementation decreased the serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and high-mobility group protein 1 (HMG-1) but raised the concentration of interleukin 10 (IL-10), compared with the levels in CLP mice. Meanwhile, high-fiber supplementation increased the relative proportions of ",

        "Title": "Hydrogen‑rich medium alleviates high glucose‑induced oxidative stress and parthanatos in rat Schwann cells in vitro.",
        "Abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is considered to be the most common cause of microvascular diabetic complications, for which no effective therapies currently exist. Previous studies have identified that oxidative stress is the common pathway in all possible hypotheses for the induction of DPN, and poly(ADP‑ribose) (PAR) polymerase‑1 (PARP‑1)‑dependent cell death (parthanatos) is key in the pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects and corresponding mechanisms of hydrogen‑rich medium (HM) on high glucose (HG)‑induced oxidative stress and parthanatos in primary rat Schwann cells (RSCs) in vitro. The RSCs were divided into groups and treated for 48 h. Cell counting kit‑8 and lactate dehydrogenase assays were used to detect cell viability and cytotoxicity, respectively; intracellular OH‑ levels were measured using a DCFH‑DA assay; concentrations of peroxynitrite (ONOO‑) and 8‑hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8‑OHdG) were evaluated with an enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay; relative expression levels of parthanatos‑related proteins [PAR, nucleus apoptosis‑inducing factor (AIF) and total AIF] were analyzed using western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence was used to determine the nuclear translocation of AIF. After 48 h, HG was shown to induce severe oxidative stress and promote marked levels of parthanatos in the RSCs. Treatment with HM inhibited HG‑induced oxidative stress by reducing the production of OH‑ and ONOO‑ and suppressed parthanatos by downregulating the levels of 8‑OHdG, the expression of PAR and the nuclear translocation of AIF. HM improved cell viability and inhibited cytotoxicity under the HG condition. These results indicate that HM effectively reduces HG‑induced oxidative stress in RSCs and protects them against parthanatos. Therefore, HM may be a novel treatment for DPN.",

In this study we aim to investigate the effect of hemopexin (HPX) in protecting synaptic plasticity and blood brain barrier integrity from toxic heme, and determine whether this effect is via the activation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) through the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway. Our data indicates HPX showed a significant effect in inducing the expression of HO-1, promoting the migration and differentiation of EPCs, facilitating new blood vessel formation thus protecting blood-brain barrier integrity. Also the magnitude of synaptic plasticity of rats recovered with HPX treatment. And in the presence of HO-1 blocker Zinc protoporphyrin-9 (ZnppIX), HPX lost its protective effect. This suggests that HPX protects endothelial and blood brain barrier integrity from toxic heme, thus protects neurologic function in cerebral ischemic rats in HO-1 pathway.",

        "Title": "Effect of autophagy on allodynia, hyperalgesia and astrocyte activation in a rat model of neuropathic pain.",
        "Abstract": "Primary damage or dysfunction of the nervous system may cause or initiate neuropathic pain. However, it has been difficult to establish an effective treatment for neuropathic pain, as the mechanisms responsible for its pathology remain largely unknown. Autophagy is closely associated with the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases, neuropathic injury and cancer, among others. The aim of the present study was to examine the changes in the autophagy‑lysosomal pathway and discuss the effects of autophagy on allodynia, hyperalgesia and astrocyte activation in neuropathic pain. A neuropathic pain model was induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats. Inducers and inhibitors of autophagy and lysosomes were used to assess autophagy, allodynia, hyperalgesia and astrocyte activity. Neuropathic pain was found to induce an increase in the levels of the autophagy‑related proteins, LC3II and Beclin 1 and, and in those of the lysosomal proteins, lysosomal‑associated membrane protein type 2 (LAMP2) and Ras‑related protein Rab‑7a (RAB7), whereas p62 levels were found to decrease from day 1 to 14 following CCI. The autophagy inducer, rapamycin, further increased the LC3II, Beclin 1, lysosomal‑associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) and Ras‑related protein Rab‑7a (RAB7) expression levels, and decreased the p62 expression levels, which were accompanied by alleviation of allodynia, hyperalgesia and astrocyte activation in the rats subjected to CCI; the autophagy inhibitor, 3‑methyladenine, reversed these effects. The use of the lysosomal inhibitors, bafilomycin and chloroquine, resulted in the accumulation of LC3II and Beclin 1, a decrease in the levels of LAMP2 and RAB7, and the exacerbation of allodynia, hyperalgesia and astrocyte activation in rats with neuropathic pain. On the whole, the findings of this study indicate that neuropathic pain activates autophagy, which alleviates mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and suppresses astrocyte activity. Therefore, neuropathic pain induced by CCI in rats appears to be mediated via the autophagy‑lysosomal pathway.",

        "Title": "Proteomic Analysis of the Downstream Signaling Network of PARP1.",
        "Abstract": "Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a protein posttranslational modification (PTM) that is critically involved in many biological processes that are linked to cell stress responses. It is catalyzed by a class of enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). In particular, PARP1 is a nuclear protein that is activated upon sensing nicked DNA. Once activated, PARP1 is responsible for the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins and initiation of the DNA damage response mechanisms. This observation provided the rationale for developing PARP1 inhibitors for the treatment of human malignancies. Indeed, three PARP1 inhibitors (Olaparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib) have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Moreover, in 2017, both Olaparib and Niraparib have also been approved for the treatment of fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. Despite this very exciting progress in the clinic, the basic signaling mechanism that connects PARP1 to a diverse array of biological processes is still poorly understood. This is, in large part, due to the inherent technical difficulty associated with the analysis of protein PARylation, which is a low-abundance, labile, and heterogeneous PTM. The study of PARylation has been greatly facilitated by the recent advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies tailored to the analysis of this modification. In this Perspective, we discuss these breakthroughs, including their technical development, and applications that provide a global view of the many biological processes regulated by this important protein modification.",

Although DNA strand breaks are potent stimuli of PARP1 enzymatic activity, the context-dependent mechanism regulating PARP1 activation and signaling is poorly understood. We performed global characterization of the PARP1-dependent, Asp/Glu-ADP-ribosylated proteome in a panel of cell lines originating from benign breast epithelial cells, as well as common subtypes of breast cancer. From these analyses, we identified 503 specific ADP-ribosylation sites on 322 proteins. Despite similar expression levels, PARP1 is differentially activated in these cell lines under genotoxic conditions, which generates signaling outputs with substantial heterogeneity. By comparing protein abundances and ADP-ribosylation levels, we could dissect cell-specific PARP1 targets that are driven by unique expression patterns versus cell-specific regulatory mechanisms of PARylation. Intriguingly, PARP1 modifies many proteins in a cell-specific manner, including those involved in transcriptional regulation, mRNA metabolism, and protein translation.",

        "Abstract": "We studied the effects of minocycline (an inhibitor of microglial activation) on the expression and activity of Notch-1 receptor, and explored the therapeutic efficacy of minocycline combined with Notch inhibitor DAPT in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP). Diabetic rat model was established by intraperitoneal injection (ip) of Streptozotocin (STZ). Expression and activity of Notch-1 and expression of macrophage/microglia marker Iba-1 were detected by WB. Diabetes induction significantly attenuated sciatic nerve conduction velocity, and dramatically augmented the expression and the activity of Notch-1 in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord. Minocycline treatment, however, accelerated the decreased conduction velocity of sciatic nerve and suppressed Notch-1expression and activity in diabetic rats. Similar to DAPT treatment, minocycline administration also prolonged thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) and increase mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) in diabetic rats in response to heat or mechanical stimulation via inhibition the expression and the activity of Notch-1 in spinal cord. Combination of DAPT and minocycline further inhibited Notch-1 receptor signaling and reduce neuropathic pain exhibited as improved TWL and MWT. Our study revealed a novel mechanism of Notch-1 receptor inhibition in spinal cord induced by minocycline administration, and suggested that the combination of minocycline and DAPT has the potential to treat DNP.",

        "Title": "Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) Embedded Core-Needle Biopsy of Lung Cancer.",
        "Abstract": "With recent advances in understanding the genomic underpinnings and oncogenic drivers of pathogenesis in different subtypes, it is increasingly clear that proper pretreatment diagnostics are essential for the choice of appropriate treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tumor tissue preservation in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound is commonly used in the surgical suite. However, proteins recovered from OCT-embedded specimens pose a challenge for LC-MS/MS experiments, due to the large amounts of polymers present in OCT. Here we present a simple workflow for whole proteome analysis of OCT-embedded NSCLC tissue samples, which involves a simple trichloroacetic acid precipitation step. Comparisons of protein recovery between frozen versus OCT-embedded tissue showed excellent consistency with more than 9200 proteins identified. Using an isobaric labeling strategy, we quantified more than 5400 proteins in tumor versus normal OCT-embedded core needle biopsy samples. Gene ontology analysis indicated that a number of proliferative as well as squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) marker proteins were overexpressed in the tumor, consistent with the patient's pathology based diagnosis of \"poorly differentiated SqCC\". Among the most downregulated proteins in the tumor sample, we noted a number of proteins with potential immunomodulatory functions. Finally, interrogation of the aberrantly expressed proteins using a candidate approach and cross-referencing with publicly available databases led to the identification of potential druggable targets in DNA replication and DNA damage repair pathways. We conclude that our approach allows LC-MS/MS proteomic analyses on OCT-embedded lung cancer specimens, opening the way to bring powerful proteomics into the clinic. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin resistance is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. Although multiple genetic and physiological factors interact to cause insulin resistance, deregulated signaling by phosphorylation is a common underlying mechanism. In particular, the specific phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanisms and signaling outputs of insulin are poorly understood in hepatocytes, which represents one of the most important insulin-responsive cell types. Using primary rat hepatocytes as a model system, we performed reductive dimethylation (ReDi)-based quantitative mass spectrometric analysis and characterized the phosphoproteome that is regulated by insulin as well as its key downstream kinases including Akt, mTORC1, and S6K. We identified a total of 12 294 unique, confidently localized phosphorylation sites and 3805 phosphorylated proteins in this single cell type. Detailed bioinformatic analysis on each individual data set identified both known and previously unrecognized targets of this key insulin downstream effector pathway. Furthermore, integrated analysis of the hepatic Akt/mTORC1/S6K signaling axis allowed the delineation of the substrate specificity of several close-related kinases within the insulin signaling pathway. We expect that the data sets will serve as an invaluable resource, providing the foundation for future hypothesis-driven research that helps delineate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and related metabolic syndrome.",

        "Title": "Itraq-Based Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Lungs in Murine Polymicrobial Sepsis with Hydrogen Gas Treatment.",
        "Abstract": "Sepsis-associated acute lung injury (ALI), which carries a high morbidity and mortality in patients, has no effective therapeutic strategies to date. Our group has already reported that hydrogen gas (H2) exerts a protective effect against sepsis in mice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying H2 treatment are not fully understood. This study investigated the effects of H2 on lung injuries in septic mice through the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic analysis. Male ICR mice used in this study were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation. And 2% H2 was inhaled for 1 h beginning at 1 and 6 h after sham or CLP operation. The iTRAQ-based liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was preformed to investigate lung proteomics. Sepsis-challenged animals had decreased survival rate, as well as had increased bacterial burden in blood, peritoneal lavage, and lung sample, which were significantly ameliorated by H2 treatment. Moreover, a total of 4,472 proteins were quantified, and 192 differentially expressed proteins were related to the protective mechanism of H2 against sepsis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that H2-related differential proteins could be related to muscle contraction, oxygen transport, protein synthesis, collagen barrier membranes, cell adhesion, and coagulation function. These proteins were significantly enriched in four signaling pathways, and two of which are associated with coagulation. In addition, H2 alleviates ALI in septic mice through downregulating the expression of Sema 7A, OTULIN, and MAP3K1 as well as upregulating the expression of Transferrin. Thus, our findings provide an insight into the mechanism of H2 treatment in sepsis by proteomic approach, which may be helpful to the clinic application of H2 in patients with sepsis.",

        "Title": "Hydrogen Gas Protects Against Intestinal Injury in Wild Type But Not NRF2 Knockout Mice With Severe Sepsis by Regulating HO-1 and HMGB1 Release.",
        "Abstract": "The intestine plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Hydrogen gas (H2), which has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, can be effectively used to treat septic mice. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive master switch that regulates the expression of antioxidant and protective enzymes. This study investigated the effects of 2% H2 on intestinal injuries and the underlying mechanisms in a mouse model of severe sepsis. Male Nrf2 knockout mice (Nrf2-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were randomized into four groups: sham, sham+H2, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and CLP+H2. The survival rate was observed and recorded within 7 days, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, HMGB1), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, and catalase ), and oxidative products (MDA, 8-iso-PGF2α) were detected in the serum and intestine using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, the protein and mRNA levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were measured by Western blotting and quantitative PCR, respectively. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were used to measure HMGB1 and HO-1 release into the intestine, respectively. The results showed that therapy with 2% H2 increased the survival rate, alleviated the injuries caused by oxidative stress and inflammation, reduced HMGB1 levels but increased HO-1 levels in WT septic mice, but not in Nrf2-KO mice. These data demonstrate that 2% H2 inhalation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for intestinal injuries caused by severe sepsis through the regulation of HO-1 and HMGB1 release. In addition, Nrf2 plays a key role in the protective effects of H2 against intestinal damage in this disease.",

Simultaneously, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and IL-18 have been illustrated as pivotal indicators to diagnose the acute kidney injury (AKI) early. This multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study aimed to investigate whether 6% HES 130/0.4 administration caused postoperative AKI, which can be revealed by urinary and plasma NGAL and IL-18 estimations in elderly patients with normal renal function undergoing hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia.",

        "Title": "Secreted IGFBP5 mediates mTORC1-dependent feedback inhibition of IGF-1 signalling.",
        "Abstract": "The PI(3)K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway is a highly dynamic network that is balanced and stabilized by a number of feedback inhibition loops. Specifically, activation of mTORC1 has been shown to lead to the inhibition of its upstream growth factor signalling. Activation of the growth factor receptors is triggered by the binding of their cognate ligands in the extracellular space. However, whether secreted proteins contribute to the mTORC1-dependent feedback loops remains unclear. We found that cells with hyperactive mTORC1 secrete a protein that potently inhibits the function of IGF-1. Using a large-scale, unbiased quantitative proteomic platform, we comprehensively characterized the rapamycin-sensitive secretome in TSC2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and identified IGFBP5 as a secreted, mTORC1 downstream effector protein. IGFBP5 is a direct transcriptional target of HIF1, which itself is a known mTORC1 target. IGFBP5 is a potent inhibitor of both the signalling and functional outputs of IGF-1. Once secreted, IGFBP5 cooperates with intracellular branches of the feedback mechanisms to block the activation of IGF-1 signalling. Finally, IGFBP5 is a potential tumour suppressor, and the proliferation of IGFBP5-mutated cancer cells is selectively blocked by IGF-1R inhibitors.",

        "Title": "Quantitative Secretomic Analysis Identifies Extracellular Protein Factors That Modulate the Metastatic Phenotype of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men and women in the United States, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) representing 85% of all diagnoses. Late stage detection, metastatic disease and lack of actionable biomarkers contribute to the high mortality rate. Proteins in the extracellular space are known to be critically involved in regulating every stage of the pathogenesis of lung cancer. To investigate the mechanism by which secreted proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of NSCLC, we performed quantitative secretomic analysis of two isogenic NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H1993 and NCI-H2073) and an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3-KT) as control. H1993 was derived from a chemo-naïve metastatic tumor, while H2073 was derived from the primary tumor after etoposide/cisplatin therapy. From the conditioned media of these three cell lines, we identified and quantified 2713 proteins, including a series of proteins involved in regulating inflammatory response, programmed cell death and cell motion. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicates that a number of proteins overexpressed in H1993 media are involved in biological processes related to cancer metastasis, including cell motion, cell-cell adhesion and cell migration. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock down of a number of these proteins, including SULT2B1, CEACAM5, SPRR3, AGR2, S100P, and S100A14, leads to dramatically reduced migration of these cells. In addition, meta-analysis of survival data indicates NSCLC patients whose tumors express higher levels of several of these secreted proteins, including SULT2B1, CEACAM5, SPRR3, S100P, and S100A14, have a worse prognosis. Collectively, our results provide a potential molecular link between deregulated secretome and NSCLC cell migration/metastasis. In addition, the identification of these aberrantly secreted proteins might facilitate the development of biomarkers for early detection of this devastating disease.",

        "Title": "An adaptive kernel smoothing method for classifying Austrosimulium tillyardianum (Diptera: Simuliidae) larval instars.",
        "Abstract": "In insects, the frequency distribution of the measurements of sclerotized body parts is generally used to classify larval instars and is characterized by a multimodal overlap between instar stages. Nonparametric methods with fixed bandwidths, such as histograms, have significant limitations when used to fit this type of distribution, making it difficult to identify divisions between instars. Fixed bandwidths have also been chosen somewhat subjectively in the past, which is another problem. In this study, we describe an adaptive kernel smoothing method to differentiate instars based on discontinuities in the growth rates of sclerotized insect body parts. From Brooks' rule, we derived a new standard for assessing the quality of instar classification and a bandwidth selector that more accurately reflects the distributed character of specific variables. We used this method to classify the larvae of Austrosimulium tillyardianum (Diptera: Simuliidae) based on five different measurements. Based on head capsule width and head capsule length, the larvae were separated into nine instars. Based on head capsule postoccipital width and mandible length, the larvae were separated into 8 instars and 10 instars, respectively. No reasonable solution was found for antennal segment 3 length. Separation of the larvae into nine instars using head capsule width or head capsule length was most robust and agreed with Crosby's growth rule. By strengthening the distributed character of the separation variable through the use of variable bandwidths, the adaptive kernel smoothing method could identify divisions between instars more effectively and accurately than previous methods.",

        "Title": "Molecular hydrogen protects mice against polymicrobial sepsis by ameliorating endothelial dysfunction via an Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Endothelial injury is a primary cause of sepsis and sepsis-induced organ damage. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) plays an essential role in endothelial cellular defenses against inflammation by activating nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). We found that molecular hydrogen (H2) exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. Here, we hypothesized that H2 attenuates endothelial injury and inflammation via an Nrf2-mediated HO-1 pathway during sepsis. First, we detected the effects of H2 on cell viability and cell apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated by LPS. Then, we measured cell adhesion molecules and inflammatory factors in HUVECs stimulated by LPS and in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis mouse model. Next, the role of Nrf2/HO-1 was investigated in activated HUVECs, as well as in wild-type and Nrf(-/-) mice with sepsis. We found that both 0.3 mmol/L and 0.6 mmol/L (i.e., saturated) H2-rich media improved cell viability and cell apoptosis in LPS-activated HUVECs and that 0.6mmol/L (i.e., saturated) H2-rich medium exerted an optimal effect. H2 could suppress the release of cell adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). Furthermore, H2 could elevate anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels in LPS-stimulated HUVECs and in lung tissue from CLP mice. H2 enhanced HO-1 expression and activity in vitro and in vivo. HO-1 inhibition reversed the regulatory effects of H2 on cell adhesion molecules and inflammatory factors. H2 regulated endothelial injury and the inflammatory response via Nrf2-mediated HO-1 levels. These results suggest that H2 could suppress excessive inflammatory responses and endothelial injury via an Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",

        "Title": "Protective effect of hydrogen-rich medium against high glucose-induced apoptosis of Schwann cells in vitro.",
        "Abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is considered to be one of the most prevalent and life threatening microvascular diabetic complications. DPN affects up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and there are currently no efficacious therapeutic strategies available for its treatment. Previous studies have reported that oxidative stress and poly(ADP‑ribose) polymerase‑1 (PARP‑1) may be unifying factors for hyperglycemic injury. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of hydrogen‑rich medium (HM) on high glucose (HG)‑mediated oxidative stress, PARP‑1 activation and the apoptosis of Schwann cells (SCs) in vitro. The cells were divided into different groups, and were treated for 48 h. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using Cell Counting kit‑8 and annexin V/propidium iodide assays, respectively. The concentrations of 8‑hydroxy‑2‑deoxyguanosine (8‑OHdG) and peroxynitrite (ONOO‑) were detected using an enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. The presence of intracellular oxygen free radicals was confirmed using flow cytometric analysis. Colorimetric assays were performed to determine the activity of caspase‑3, and western blotting was performed to detect the protein expression levels of PARP‑1, cleaved PARP‑1, PAR, apoptosis‑inducing factor (AIF), B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) and Bcl‑2‑associated X protein. HG was found to induce severe oxidative stress and promote the caspase‑dependent and caspase‑independent apoptosis of SCs. Treatment with HM inhibited HG‑induced oxidative stress by suppressing hydroxyl and ONOO‑ production, levels of 8‑OHdG, caspase‑3 activity and apoptosis in the SCs. Furthermore, treatment with HM downregulated the HG‑induced release of PAR, the activation of PARP‑1 and nuclear translocation of AIF, and upregulated the expression of Bcl‑2 in the SCs. These results indicated that HM inhibited the HG‑induced‑oxidative stress‑associated caspase‑dependent and caspase‑independent apoptotic pathways in SCs. Therefore, HM may have potential as a treatment for DPN.",

        "Abstract": "Overactivation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), as a result of sustained DNA oxidation in ischemia-reperfusion injury, triggers programmed cell necrosis and apoptosis. The present study was conducted to demonstrate whether hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) has a neuroprotective effect on retinal ischemia reperfusion (RIR) injury through inhibition of PARP-1 activation. RIR was induced by transient elevation of intraocular pressure in rats. HRS (5 ml/kg) was administered peritoneally every day from the beginning of reperfusion in RIR rats until the rats were sacrificed. Retinal damage and cell death was determined using hematoxylin and eosin and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining. DNA oxidative stress was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine. In addition, the expression of PARP-1 and caspase-3 was investigated by western blot analysis and/or immunohistochemical staining. The results demonstrated that HRS administration improved morphological alterations and reduced apoptosis following RIR injury. Furthermore, the present study found that HRS alleviated DNA oxidation and PARP-1 overactivation in RIR rats. HRS can protect RIR injury by inhibition of PARP-1, which may be involved in DNA oxidative stress and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis.",

        "Abstract": "A search engine that discovers more peptides reliably is essential to the progress of the computational proteomics. We propose two new scoring functions (L- and P-scores), which aim to capture similar characteristics of a peptide-spectrum match (PSM) as Sequest and Comet do. Crescendo, introduced here, is a software program that implements these two scores for peptide identification. We applied Crescendo to test datasets and compared its performance with widely used search engines, including Mascot, Sequest, and Comet. The results indicate that Crescendo identifies a similar or larger number of peptides at various predefined false discovery rates (FDR). Importantly, it also provides a better separation between the true and decoy PSMs, warranting the future development of a companion post-processing filtering algorithm.",

        "Abstract": "Hydrogen gas (H2) has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects and may have beneficial effects in severe sepsis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying these protective effects. Male Institute for Cancer Research mice were randomized into 6 groups: sham; sham + H2; severe sepsis; severe sepsis + H2; severe sepsis + zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX), a heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitor; and severe sepsis + H2 + ZnPPIX. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to induce sepsis. Mice in the H2 groups received inhaled 2% H2 for 1 h at 1 h and 6 h after CLP or sham operation. Mice in the ZnPPIX groups received 40-mg/kg ZnPPIX by intraperitoneal injection 1 h before CLP. Tin protoporphyrin IX (TinPPIX), another HO-1 inhibitor, was also used in part for this study. Mice in the TinPPIX groups received 50-mg/kg TinPPIX through subcutaneous injection 6 h before CLP. The levels of biochemical markers, oxidative products, inflammatory mediator, the number of intestinal apoptotic cells, and the colony-forming unit numbers in the peritoneal lavage fluid were much higher in the severe sepsis group compared with the sham group. Intestinal injury in animals with severe sepsis was worse than that in animals in the sham group. H2 therapy in the animals with severe sepsis was associated with reduced intestinal injury, decreased numbers of colony-forming unit and apoptotic cells, reduced levels of biochemical markers, oxidative products, and high-mobility group box 1 protein. The protective effects of H2 were reversed by ZnPPIX and TinPPIX. Protein and messenger RNA expressions of HO-1 and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the intestine were increased in the severe sepsis group compared to the sham group, and H2 further increased their expressions in the severe septic mice. Zinc protoporphyrin IX and TinPPIX inhibited the expression of HO-1 protein. Hydrogen has the capacity to protect mice from organ injury in severe sepsis through a mechanism involving HO-1.",

        "Abstract": "Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. In recent years, molecular hydrogen, as an effective free radical scavenger, has been shown a selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect, and it is beneficial in the treatment of sepsis. Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase (ROCK) participates in junction between normal cells, and regulates vascular endothelial permeability. In this study, we used lipopolysaccharide to stimulate vascular endothelial cells and explored the effects of hydrogen-rich medium on the regulation of adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells and vascular endothelial permeability. We found that hydrogen-rich medium could inhibit adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells and decrease levels of adhesion molecules, whereas the levels of transepithelial/endothelial electrical resistance values and the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin were increased after hydrogen-rich medium treatment. Moreover, hydrogen-rich medium could lessen the expression of ROCK, as a similar effect of its inhibitor Y-27632. In addition, hydrogen-rich medium could also inhibit adhesion of polymorphonuclear neutrophils to endothelial cells. In conclusion, hydrogen-rich medium could regulate adhesion of monocytes/polymorphonuclear neutrophils to endothelial cells and vascular endothelial permeability, and this effect might be related to the decreased expression of ROCK protein.",

        "Abstract": "To enhance the corrosion resistance of Ti-6Al-4V and extend its lifetime in medical applications, Ti-O-N/Ti composite coating was synthesized on the surface via plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIIID). Surface morphology and cross sectional morphology of the composite coating were characterized using atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Although X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis revealed that the Ti-O-N/Ti composite coating was composed of non-stoichiometric titanium oxide, titanium nitride and titanium oxynitride, no obvious characteristic peak corresponding to the crystalline phases of them was detected in the X-ray diffraction pattern. In accordance with Owens-Wendt equation, surface free energy of the uncoated and coated samples was calculated and compared. Moreover, the corrosion behavior of uncoated and coated samples was evaluated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement, and an equivalent circuit deriving from Randles model was used to fit Bode plots and describe the electrochemical processes occurring at the sample/electrolyte interface. On the basis of the equivalent circuit model, the resistance of the composite coating was 4.7 times higher than that of the passive layer on uncoated samples, indicating the enhanced corrosion resistance after PIIID treatment. Compared to uncoated Ti-6Al-V, Ti-O-N/Ti-coated samples facilitated ostoblast proliferation within 7 days of cell culture, while there was no statistically significant difference in alkaline phosphate activity between uncoated and coated samples during 21 days of cell culture.",

        "Title": "Inhalation of hydrogen gas attenuates brain injury in mice with cecal ligation and puncture via inhibiting neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis.",
        "Abstract": "During the development of sepsis, the complication in central nervous system (CNS), appearing early and frequently relative to other systems, can obviously increase the mortality of sepsis. Moreover, sepsis survivors also accompany long-term cognitive dysfunction, while the ultimate causes and effective therapeutic strategies of brain injury in sepsis are still not fully clear. We designed this study to investigate the effects of 2% hydrogen gas (H2) on brain injury in a mouse model of sepsis. Male ICR mice were underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation. 2% H2 was inhaled for 60min beginning at both 1 and 6h after sham or CLP operation, respectively. H2 concentration in arterial blood, venous blood and brain tissue was detected after H2 inhalation separately. The survival rate was observed and recorded within 7 days after sham or CLP operation. The histopathologic changes and neuronal apoptosis were observed in hippocampus by Nissl staining and TUNEL assay. The permeability of brain-blood barrier (BBB), brain water content, inflammatory cytokines, activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT) and oxidative products (MDA and 8-iso-PGF2α) in serum and hippocampus were detected at 24h after sham or CLP operation. The expressions of nucleus and total nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and cytoplasmic heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) in hippocampus were measured at 24h after sham or CLP operation. We assessed their cognitive function via Y-maze and Fear Conditioning test on day 3, 5, 7 and 14 after operation. H2 treatment markedly improved the survival rate and cognitive dysfunction of septic mice. CLP mice showed obvious brain injury characterized by aggravated pathological damage, BBB disruption and brain edema at 24h after CLP operation, which was markedly alleviated by 2% H2 treatment. Furthermore, we found that the beneficial effects of H2 on brain injury in septic mice were linked to the decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative products and the increased activities of antioxidant enzymes in serum and hippocampus. In addition, 2% H2 inhalation promoted the expression and transposition of Nrf2 and the expression of HO-1 to mitigate brain injury in sepsis. Thus, the inhalation of hydrogen gas may be a promising therapeutic strategy to relieve brain injury in sepsis.",

It remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients despite developments in monitoring devices, diagnostic tools, and new therapeutic options. Recently, some studies have found that molecular hydrogen is a new therapeutic gas. Our studies have found that hydrogen gas can improve the survival and organ damage in mice and rats with cecal ligation and puncture, zymosan, and lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis. The mechanisms are associated with the regulation of oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and apoptosis, which might be through NF- κ B and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. In this paper, we summarized the progress of hydrogen treatment in sepsis.",

        "Title": "Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis reveals system-wide signaling pathways downstream of SDF-1/CXCR4 in breast cancer stem cells.",
        "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, with an estimated 1.7 million new cases and 522,000 deaths around the world in 2012 alone. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are essential for tumor reoccurrence and metastasis which is the major source of cancer lethality. G protein-coupled receptor chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) is critical for tumor metastasis. However, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4-mediated signaling pathways in breast CSCs are largely unknown. Using isotope reductive dimethylation and large-scale MS-based quantitative phosphoproteome analysis, we examined protein phosphorylation induced by SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling in breast CSCs. We quantified more than 11,000 phosphorylation sites in 2,500 phosphoproteins. Of these phosphosites, 87% were statistically unchanged in abundance in response to SDF-1/CXCR4 stimulation. In contrast, 545 phosphosites in 266 phosphoproteins were significantly increased, whereas 113 phosphosites in 74 phosphoproteins were significantly decreased. SDF-1/CXCR4 increases phosphorylation in 60 cell migration- and invasion-related proteins, of them 43 (>70%) phosphoproteins are unrecognized. In addition, SDF-1/CXCR4 upregulates the phosphorylation of 44 previously uncharacterized kinases, 8 phosphatases, and 1 endogenous phosphatase inhibitor. Using computational approaches, we performed system-based analyses examining SDF-1/CXCR4-mediated phosphoproteome, including construction of kinase-substrate network and feedback regulation loops downstream of SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling in breast CSCs. We identified a previously unidentified SDF-1/CXCR4-PKA-MAP2K2-ERK signaling pathway and demonstrated the feedback regulation on MEK, ERK1/2, δ-catenin, and PPP1Cα in SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling in breast CSCs. This study gives a system-wide view of phosphorylation events downstream of SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling in breast CSCs, providing a resource for the study of CSC-targeted cancer therapy.",

        "Title": "Molecular hydrogen ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice through reducing inflammation and apoptosis.",
        "Abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Recently, our and other studies have found that hydrogen gas (H₂) treatment can ameliorate the lung injury induced by sepsis, ventilator, hyperoxia, and ischemia-reperfusion. However, the molecular mechanisms by which H₂ ameliorates lung injury remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated whether H₂ or hydrogen-rich saline (HS) could exert protective effects in a mouse model of ALI induced by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via inhibiting the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway-mediated inflammation and apoptosis. Two percent of H₂ was inhaled for 1 h beginning at 1 and 6 h after LPS administration, respectively. We found that LPS-challenged mice exhibited significant lung injury characterized by the deterioration of histopathology and histologic scores, wet-to-dry weight ratio, and oxygenation index (PaO₂/FIO₂), as well as total protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), which was attenuated by H₂ treatment. Hydrogen gas treatment inhibited LPS-induced pulmonary early and late NF-κB activation. Moreover, H₂ treatment dramatically prevented the LPS-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in LPS-challenged mice, as reflected by the decrease in TUNEL (deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) staining-positive cells and caspase 3 activity. Furthermore, H₂ treatment markedly attenuated LPS-induced lung neutrophil recruitment and inflammation, as evidenced by downregulation of lung myeloperoxidase activity, total cells, and polymorphonuclear neutrophils in BALF, as well as proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and high-mobility group box 1) and chemokines (keratinocyte-derived chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP] 1α, MIP-2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) in BALF. In addition, i.p. injection of 10 mL/kg hydrogen-rich saline also significantly attenuated the LPS-induced ALI. Collectively, these results demonstrate that molecular hydrogen treatment ameliorates LPS-induced ALI through reducing lung inflammation and apoptosis, which may be associated with the decreased NF-κB activity. Hydrogen gas may be useful as a novel therapy to treat ALI. munosorbent assay; H₂-hydrogen gas; HMGB1-high-mobility group box 1; HS-hydrogen-rich saline; i.t.-intratracheal; KC-keratinocyte-derived chemokine; LPS-lipopolysaccharide; MCP-1-monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; MIP-1α-macrophage inflammatory protein 1α; MIP-2-macrophage inflammatory protein 2; MPO-myeloperoxidase; PBS-phosphate-buffered saline; PMNs-polymorphonuclear neutrophils; TUNEL-deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling; W/D-wet-to-dry.",

        "Abstract": "The p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays a key role in cell growth and proliferation by regulating insulin sensitivity, metabolism, protein synthesis, and cell cycle. Thus, deregulation of S6K contributes to the progression of type 2 diabetes, obesity, aging, and cancer. Considering the biological and clinical importance of S6K1, a complete understanding of its regulation is critical. One of the key motifs in the activation of S6K1 is a turn motif, but its regulation is not well understood. Here we provide evidence for two mechanisms of modulating turn motif phosphorylation and S6K1 activity. First, mammalian target of rapamycin regulates turn motif phosphorylation by inhibiting its dephosphorylation. Second, we unexpectedly found that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 promotes turn motif phosphorylation. Our studies show that mammalian target of rapamycin and GSK-3 cooperate to control the activity of S6K1, an important regulator of cell proliferation and growth. Our unexpected results provide a clear rationale for the development and use of drugs targeting GSK-3 to treat diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and age-related diseases that are linked to improper regulation of S6K1.",

        "Abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved serine-threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a critical role in regulating many pathophysiological processes. Functional characterization of the mTOR signaling pathways, however, has been hampered by the paucity of known substrates. We used large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics experiments to define the signaling networks downstream of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Characterization of one mTORC1 substrate, the growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10), showed that mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation stabilized Grb10, leading to feedback inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-regulated, mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK-MAPK) pathways. Grb10 expression is frequently down-regulated in various cancers, and loss of Grb10 and loss of the well-established tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN appear to be mutually exclusive events, suggesting that Grb10 might be a tumor suppressor regulated by mTORC1.",

        "Abstract": "Sepsis/multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. Recently, it has been suggested that hydrogen gas (H2) exerts a therapeutic antioxidant activity by selectively reducing hydroxyl radical (•OH, the most cytotoxic reactive oxygen species). We have found that H2 inhalation significantly improved the survival rate and organ damage of septic mice with moderate or severe cecal ligation and puncture. In the present study, we investigated the effects of 2% H2 treatment on survival rate and organ damage in zymosan (ZY)-induced generalized inflammation model. Here, we found that 2% H2 inhalation for 60 min starting at 1 and 6 h after ZY injection, respectively, significantly improved the 14-day survival rate of ZY-challenged mice from 10% to 70%. Furthermore, ZY-challenged mice showed significant multiple organ damage characterized by the increase in serum biochemical parameters (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine), as well as lung, liver, and kidney histopathological scores at 24 h after ZY injection, which was significantly attenuated by 2% H2 treatment. In addition, we found that the beneficial effects of H2 treatment on ZY-induced organ damage were associated with the decreased levels of oxidative product, increased activities of antioxidant enzyme, and reduced levels of early and late proinflammatory cytokines in serum and tissues. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that H2 treatment protects against multiple organ damages in ZY-induced generalized inflammation model, suggesting the potential use of H2 as a therapeutic agent in the therapy of conditions associated with inflammation-related multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.",

Recently, it has been suggested that molecular hydrogen (H2) exerts a therapeutic antioxidant activity by selectively reducing hydroxyl radicals (*OH, the most cytotoxic reactive oxygen species) and effectively protects against organ damage induced by I/R. Therefore, we hypothesized that H2 treatment had a beneficial effect on sepsis. In the present study, we found that H2 inhalation starting at 1 and 6 h after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation significantly improved the survival rate of septic mice with moderate or severe CLP in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, moderate or severe CLP mice showed significant multiple organ damage characterized by the increases of lung myeloperoxidase activity, wet-to-dry weight ratio, protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage, serum biochemical parameters, and organ histopathologic scores at 24 h after CLP operation, which was significantly attenuated by 2% H2 treatment. In addition, we found that the beneficial effects of H2 treatment on sepsis and sepsis-associated organ damage were associated with the decreased levels of oxidative product, increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, and reduced levels of high-mobility group box 1 in serum and tissue. Thus, H2 inhalation may be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with sepsis.",

        "Abstract": "Constitutive activation of one or more kinase signaling pathways is a hallmark of many cancers. Here we extend the previously described mass spectrometry-based KAYAK approach by monitoring kinase activities from multiple signaling pathways simultaneously. This improved single-reaction strategy, which quantifies the phosphorylation of 90 synthetic peptides in a single mass spectrometry run, is compatible with nanogram to microgram amounts of cell lysate. Furthermore, the approach enhances kinase monospecificity through substrate competition effects, faithfully reporting the signatures of many signaling pathways after mitogen stimulation or of basal pathway activation differences across a panel of well-studied cancer cell lines. Hierarchical clustering of activities from related experiments groups peptides phosphorylated by similar kinases together and, when combined with pathway alteration using pharmacological inhibitors, distinguishes underlying differences in potency, off-target effects and genetic backgrounds. Finally, we introduce a strategy to identify the kinase, and even associated protein complex members, responsible for phosphorylation events of interest.",

        "Abstract": "Most kinases are capable of recognizing and phosphorylating peptides containing short, linear sequence motifs. To measure the activation state of many kinases from the same cell lysate, we created a multiplexed, mass-spectrometry-based in vitro kinase assay. Ninety chemically synthesized peptides derived from well-characterized peptide substrates and in vivo phosphorylation sites with either known or previously unidentified upstream kinases were reacted individually in a plate format with crude cell lysates and ATP. Phosphorylation rates were directly measured based on the addition of 90 same-sequence, site-specific phosphopeptides enriched in stable isotopes to act as ideal quantitative internal standards for analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This approach concurrently measured up to 90 site-specific peptide phosphorylation rates, reporting a diagnostic fingerprint for activated kinase pathways. We applied this unique kinome-activity profiling strategy in a variety of cellular settings, including mitogen stimulation, cell cycle, pharmacological inhibition of pathways, and to a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Finally, we identified the source of activity for a peptide (derived from a PI3K regulatory subunit) from our library. This peptide substrate demonstrated mitotic and tyrosine-specific phosphorylation, which was confirmed to be a novel Src family kinase site in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Chemokines participate in well documented interactions with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Although many chemokine amino acid residues involved in binding have been identified, much less is known about the bound regions of GAG. Heparan sulfate (HS) is the predominant cell surface GAG, and its heterogeneous nature offers proteins a variety of structural motifs with which to interact. In the present study, we describe the interactions of three CC chemokines, MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-2/CCL8, and MCP-3/CCL7, with HS-derived oligosaccharides. To this end, we generated and characterized a complex HS octasaccharide library containing 17 different octasaccharide compositions based on acetyl and sulfate group content. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to detect chemokine-HS octasaccharide complexes in the bound state, and an affinity purification protocol was used to select and identify chemokine-binding octasaccharides from the complex mixture. The results indicate that HS octasaccharide sulfation is the foremost requirement for chemokine binding. However, within octasaccharides of constant charge density, acetylation is also observed to augment binding, suggesting that there may be as yet undiscovered specificity in the chemokine-HS interaction.",

We describe a subtractive strategy to determine the sites of tyrosine O-sulfation in proteins. Hydroxyl groups on unsulfated tyrosines are blocked by stoichiometric acetylation in a one-step reaction using sulfosuccinimidyl acetate (S-NHSAc) in the presence of imidazole at pH 7.0. The presence of sulfotyrosine is indicated by the detection of free tyrosine after tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis under conditions in which the sulfuryl group of sulfotyrosine is labile. Since phosphorylation and sulfation of tyrosine are isobaric, we used alkaline phosphatase treatment to distinguish these two modifications. Using this methodology we identified the sites and the order of sulfation of several peptides mediated by purified human tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases (TPSTs), and unambiguously determined the tyrosine sulfation sites in mouse lumican and human vitronectin.",

        "Title": "Heterodimerization of CCR2 chemokines and regulation by glycosaminoglycan binding.",
        "Abstract": "Despite the wide range of sequence diversity among chemokines, their tertiary structures are remarkably similar. Furthermore, many chemokines form dimers or higher order oligomers, but all characterized oligomeric structures are based primarily on two dimerization motifs represented by CC-chemokine or CXC-chemokine dimer interfaces. These observations raise the possibility that some chemokines could form unique hetero-oligomers using the same oligomerization motifs. Such interactions could modulate the overall signaling response of the receptors, thereby providing a general mechanism for regulating chemokine function. For some chemokines, homo-oligomerization has also been shown to be coupled to glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding. However, the effect of GAG binding on chemokine hetero-oligomerization has not yet been demonstrated. In this report, we characterized the heterodimerization of the CCR2 ligands MCP-1 (CCL2), MCP-2 (CCL8), MCP-3 (CCL7), MCP-4 (CCL13), and eotaxin (CCL11), as well as the effects of GAG binding, using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI-FTICR) mass spectrometry. Strong heterodimerization was observed between CCL2 and CCL8 at the expense of homodimer formation. Using NMR, we showed that the heterodimer is predominant in solution and forms a specific CC chemokine-like dimer. By contrast, only moderate heterodimer formation was observed between CCL2.CCL13, CCL2.CCL11 and CCL8.CCL13, and no heterodimerization was observed when any other CCR2 ligand was added to CCL7. To investigate the effect of a highly sulfated GAG on the formation of heterodimers, each chemokine pair was mixed with the heparin pentasaccharide, Arixtra, and assayed by ESI-FTICR mass spectrometry. Although no CCL8.CCL11 heterodimer was observed in the absence of GAG, abundant ions corresponding to the ternary complex, CCL8.CCL11.Arixtra, were observed upon addition of Arixtra. Heterodimerization between CCL2 and CCL11 was also enhanced in the presence of Arixtra. In summary, these results indicate that some CCR2 ligands can form stable heterodimers in preference to homodimers and that these interactions, like those of homo-oligomers, can be influenced by some GAGs.",

        "Abstract": "Chemokine-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions have been shown to be essential for in vivo chemokine signaling, which functions in such diverse processes as inflammation, development, and cancer metastasis. Despite the importance of these interactions, the saccharide sequence dependency of chemokine-GAG interactions is poorly understood. In a recent study, FT-ICR mass spectrometry was used to show that the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) binds only to the 11- and 12-sulfated components of a heparin octasaccharide library. Although the exact structure of the fully sulfated, 12-sulfated octasaccharide is known, the 11-sulfated species could have a number of sulfated disaccharide sequences. In the current study, the composition of the 11-sulfated heparin octasaccharides, as well as the composition of CCL2 affinity purified 11-sulfated heparin octasaccharides, were examined by tandem MS. Of the three possible singly desulfated disaccharides, one species, III-S, is enriched by CCL2 affinity purification, indicating that the 11-sulfated heparin octasaccharides containing this disaccharide are preferentially bound to CCL2. These data suggest that 2-O and N sulfation of heparin may be of greater importance to CCL2-heparin binding than 6-O sulfation.",

        "Abstract": "Chemokines play a critical role in inducing chemotaxis, extravasation, and activation of leukocytes both in routine immunosurveillance and autoimmune diseases. Traditionally, to disrupt chemokine function, strategies have focused on blockage of its interaction with the receptor. Recently, it has been demonstrated that binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is also required for the in vivo activity of many chemokines. Thus, interference with the GAG-binding of chemokines may offer an alternative, valid, anti-inflammatory strategy. However, the potential of using small polyanions to inhibit the interactions between chemokines and cell surface GAGs has not been fully explored. In this study, a mass spectrometry based filtration trapping assay was utilized to study the interactions between two CCR 2 ligands (MCP-1/CCL2 and MCP-3/CCL7) and a series of low molecular weight, polyanionic molecules. Findings were confirmed by using a hydrophobic trapping assay. The results indicated that Arixtra (fondaparinux sodium), sucrose octasulfate, and suramin were specific binders of the chemokines, while cyclodextrin sulfate, although the most highly sulfated molecule among the ones investigated, showed no binding. The binding stoichiometry of the small molecule ligand was determined from the measured molecular weight of the noncovalent complex. Furthermore, the dissociation constant between MCP-3 and Arixtra was determined by using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI FT-ICR) mass spectrometry, which compared favorably with the result of the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay. The relative binding affinity of these ligands to MCP-3 was also determined using a competitive filtration trapping assay.",

        "Abstract": "Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI-FTICR) mass spectrometry was used to study the noncovalent complexation of a metalloenzyme, phosphomannose isomerase (PMI), which catalyzes the interconversion of mannose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. The zinc cofactor binding effect and the noncovalent interactions of the holoenzyme with its two natural substrates and two inhibitors, erythrose 4-phosphate and mannitol 1-phosphate, were investigated. Under nondenaturing conditions, the intact zinc-containing monomeric protein ions were reproducibly observed with no dissociation. Molecular ions corresponding to apo-PMI monomer were obtained by dialyzing the holoenzyme against EDTA. The binding/release of the metal ion did not alter the charge-state distributions of the protein to any significant extent, but changed the binding affinity of the substrates by at least 5-fold. Using ESI-FTICR mass spectrometry, the binding stoichiometry and specificity of the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-inhibitor complexes were directly determined. The first time report of the apparent dissociation constant for the isomeric substrates of PMI was measured to be 88.8 microM. The relative dissociation constant of the two inhibitors derived from gas-phase noncovalent complexation was very similar to the relative inhibition constant derived from solution phase kinetics.",

        "Abstract": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have recently been demonstrated to be required for the in vivo activity of several chemokines. Minimally, the interaction is thought to provide a mechanism for retention at the site of secretion and the formation of chemokine gradients that provide directional cues for receptor bearing cells, particularly in the presence of shear forces. Thus, a key issue will be to determine the sequence and structure of the GAGs that bind to specific chemokines. Herein, we describe a mass spectrometry assay that was developed to detect protein-oligosaccharide noncovalent complexes, in this case chemokine-GAG interactions, and to select for high affinity GAGs. The process is facilitated by the ability of electrospray ionization to transfer the intact noncovalent complexes from solution into the gas phase. The elemental composition as well as the binding stoichiometry can be calculated from the mass of the complex. Ligands of the chemokine receptor, CCR2 (MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-2/CCL8, MCP-3/CCL7, MCP-4/CCL13, and Eotaxin/CCL11), and the CCR10 ligand CTACK/CCL27 were screened against a small, highly sulfated, heparin oligosaccharide library with limited structural variation. The results revealed heparin octasaccharides with 11 and 12 sulfates as binders. Oligomerization of some chemokines was observed upon GAG binding, whereas in other instances only the monomeric noncovalent complex was identified. The results indicate that, in contrast to the apparent redundancy in the chemokine system, where several chemokines bind and activate the same receptor, these chemokines could be differentiated into two groups based on the stoichiometry of their complexes with the heparin oligosaccharides.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatitis C virus uses an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the viral RNA to directly recruit human 40S ribosome subunits during cap-independent translation initiation. Although IRES-mediated translation initiation is not subject to many of the regulatory mechanisms that control cap-dependent translation initiation, it is unknown whether other noncanonical protein factors are involved in this process. Thus, a global protein composition analysis of native and IRES-bound 40S ribosomal complexes has been conducted to facilitate an understanding of the IRES ribosome recruitment mechanism. A combined top-down and bottom-up mass spectrometry approach was used to identify both the proteins and their posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in the native 40S subunit and the IRES recruited translation initiation complex. Thirty-one out of a possible 32 ribosomal proteins were identified by combining top-down and bottom-up mass spectrometry techniques. Proteins were found to contain PTMs, including loss of methionine, acetylation, methylation, and disulfide bond formation. In addition to the 40S ribosomal proteins, RACK1 was consistently identified in the 40S fraction, indicating that this protein is associated with the 40S subunit. Similar methodology was then applied to the hepatitis C virus IRES-bound 40S complex. Two 40S ribosomal proteins, RS25 and RS29, were found to contain different PTMs than those in the native 40S subunit. In addition, RACK1, eukaryotic initiation factor 3 proteins and nucleolin were identified in the IRES-mediated translation initiation complex.",

        "Title": "Coordinated assembly of human translation initiation complexes by the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site RNA.",
        "Abstract": "Protein synthesis in all cells begins with recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit to the initiation codon in a messenger RNA. In some eukaryotic viruses, RNA upstream of the coding region forms an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that directly binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit and enables translation initiation in the absence of many canonical translation initiation factors. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES RNA requires just two initiation factors, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 and eIF3, to form preinitiation 48S ribosomal complexes that subsequently assemble into translation-competent ribosomes. Using an RNA-based affinity purification approach, we show here that HCV IRES RNA facilitates eIF2 function through its interactions with eIF3 and the 40S ribosomal subunit. Although the wild-type IRES assembles normally into 48S and 80S ribosomal complexes in human cell extract, mutant IRES RNAs become trapped at the 48S assembly stage. Trapped 48S complexes formed by IRES mutants with reduced eIF3 binding affinity nonetheless contain eIF3, consistent with inherent eIF3-40S subunit affinity. Intriguingly, however, one of these IRES mutants prevents stable association of both eIF3 and eIF2, preventing initiator tRNA deposition and explaining the block in 80S assembly. In contrast, an IRES mutant unable to induce a conformational change in the 40S subunit, as observed previously by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy, blocks 80S formation at a later stage in assembly. These data suggest that the IRES RNA coordinates interactions of eIF3 and eIF2 on the ribosome required to position the initiator tRNA on the mRNA in the ribosomal peptidyl-tRNA site (P site).",

It is also shown that information regarding solution binding affinities can be obtained using electrospray ionization (ESI)-FTICR mass spectrometry.

        "Abstract": "An efficient enzyme kinetics assay using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was initially applied to the catalytic mechanism investigation of a carbohydrate sulfotransferase, NodST. Herein, the recombinant NodST was overexpressed with a His(6)-tag and purified via Ni-NTA metal-affinity chromatography. In this bisubstrate enzymatic system, an internal standard similar in structure and ionization efficiency to the product was chosen in the ESI-MS assay, and a single point normalization factor was determined and used to quantify the product concentration. The catalytic mechanism of NodST was rapidly determined by fitting the MS kinetic data into a nonlinear regression analysis program. The initial rate kinetics analysis and product inhibition study described support a hybrid double-displacement, two-site ping-pong mechanism of NodST with formation of a sulfated NodST intermediate. This covalent intermediate was further isolated and detected via trypsin digestion and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. To our knowledge, these are the first mechanistic data reported for the bacterial sulfotransferase, NodST, which demonstrated the power of mass spectrometry in elucidating the reaction pathway and catalytic mechanism of promising enzymatic systems.",
