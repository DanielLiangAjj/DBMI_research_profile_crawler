        "Title": "A shift towards targeted post-ICU treatment: Multidisciplinary care for cardiac arrest survivors.",
        "Abstract": "Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivorship comprises a burgeoning area of critical care medicine, largely due to our improved understanding of and concern for patients' recovery trajectory, and efforts to mitigate the post-acute complications of critical illness. Expansion of care beyond hospitalization is necessary, yet evidence for post-ICU clinics remains limited and mixed, as both interventions and target populations studied to date are too heterogenous to meaningfully demonstrate efficacy. Here, we briefly present the existing evidence and limitations related to post-ICU clinics, identify cardiac arrest survivors as a unique ICU subpopulation warranting further investigation and treatment, and propose a clinical framework that addresses the multifaceted needs of this well-defined patient population.",

This intervention's feasibility needs testing in psychologically distressed cardiac patients for whom heart-related anxiety is a core concern. To enhance scalability and convenience, remote delivery of HRVB also needs to be assessed. Accordingly, we evaluated the feasibility of remote HRVB in survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) with elevated CA-related psychological distress.",

        "Abstract": "Patients evaluated in an emergency department for suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS; e.g., myocardial infarction) often experience a lingering fear of recurrence, which may adversely affect their mental health and adherence to recommended health behaviors. Cognitive bias modification training (CBMT) is an acceptable, easy-to-use intervention that reduces fear of recurrence in cancer patients, and reduces fear and anxiety in other populations, providing an alternative to psychotherapy or counseling-based approaches. Feasibility testing is needed to assess whether a cardiac-related version of CBMT is acceptable to patients with elevated threat perceptions related to their suspected ACS.",

        "Title": "Family-authored ICU diaries to reduce fear in patients experiencing a cardiac arrest (FAID fear): A pilot randomized controlled trial.",
        "Abstract": "Survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) and their family members often experience significant fear-based distress (cardiac fear; i.e., fear about the CA survivor's heart). Fear-based distress after CA is associated with higher rates of cardiac event recurrence and mortality in CA survivors. As posited in Dyadic Disruption Theory (DDT), cardiac fear in family members may contribute to the development of distress in CA survivors via socially-based mechanisms. Thus, interventions to reduce family distress may improve CA survivors' outcomes. ICU diaries are easy to implement and scalable and show promise for reducing distress after CA but are primarily targeted towards survivors. The primary aim of the Family-Authored ICU Diaries to reduce Fear in Patients Experiencing a CA (FAID Fear) pilot randomized controlled trial was to test feasibility of an ICU diary intervention targeted towards family member distress alone. Family members of patients hospitalized after CA (N = 16) were randomized 2:1 to receive the FAID Fear intervention or usual care. Intervention participants were provided brief instructions and were asked to write in the diary twice per week until the end of hospital care. Assessments occurred at baseline enrollment, end of hospital care, and 30 days later. Participants' mean age was 50.73 years (SD = 13.41; 80% cis-gender female; 60% White). Recruitment (16/25 referred; 64.0%), retention (14/16 enrolled; 87.5%), and intervention adherence (7/10 completed; 70%) were promising. Most agreed that the ICU diary intervention was appropriate (7/10 completed; 70.0%), feasible (9/10 completed; 90.0%]), and acceptable (8/10 completed; 80.0%). Fear was nonsignificantly lower in intervention participants (v. control) at end of hospital care and 30 days later. FAID Fear represents a first step in building theory-based dyadic interventions that can be implemented to support family members of CA survivors in the ICU, with potential to improve outcomes in CA survivors.",

        "Title": "Effect of Adapted Mindfulness Training in Participants With Elevated Office Blood Pressure: The MB-BP Study: A Randomized Clinical Trial.",
        "Abstract": "Background Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Despite availability of effective lifestyle and medication treatments, blood pressure (BP) is poorly controlled in the United States. Mindfulness training may offer a novel approach to improve BP control. The objective was to evaluate the effects of Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP) versus enhanced usual care control on unattended office systolic BP. Methods and Results Methods included a parallel-group phase 2 randomized clinical trial conducted from June 2017 to November 2020. Follow-up time was 6 months. Outcome assessors and data analyst were blinded to group allocation. Participants had elevated unattended office BP (≥120/80 mm Hg). We randomized 201 participants to MB-BP (n=101) or enhanced usual care control (n=100). MB-BP is a mindfulness-based program adapted for elevated BP. Loss-to-follow-up was 17.4%. The primary outcome was change in unattended office systolic BP at 6 months. A total of 201 participants (58.7% women; 81.1% non-Hispanic White race and ethnicity; mean age, 59.5 years) were randomized. Results showed that MB-BP was associated with a 5.9-mm Hg reduction (95% CI, -9.1 to -2.8 mm Hg) in systolic BP from baseline and outperformed the control group by 4.5 mm Hg at 6 months (95% CI, -9.0 to -0.1 mm Hg) in prespecified analyses. Plausible mechanisms with evidence to be impacted by MB-BP versus control were sedentary activity (-350.8 sitting min/wk [95% CI, -636.5 to -65.1] sitting min/wk), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (0.32 score [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.67]), and mindfulness (7.3 score [95% CI, 3.0-11.6]). Conclusions A mindfulness-based program adapted for individuals with elevated BP showed clinically relevant reductions in systolic BP compared with enhanced usual care. Mindfulness training may be a useful approach to improve BP. Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifiers: NCT03256890 and NCT03859076.",

        "Abstract": "An N-of-1 trial is a multi-period crossover trial performed in a single individual, with a primary goal to estimate treatment effect on the individual instead of population-level mean responses. As in a conventional crossover trial, it is critical to understand carryover effects of the treatment in an N-of-1 trial, especially when no washout periods between treatment periods are instituted to reduce trial duration. To deal with this issue in situations where a high volume of measurements are made during the study, we introduce a novel Bayesian distributed lag model that facilitates the estimation of carryover effects, while accounting for temporal correlations using an autoregressive model. Specifically, we propose a prior variance-covariance structure on the lag coefficients to address collinearity caused by the fact that treatment exposures are typically identical on successive days. A connection between the proposed Bayesian model and penalized regression is noted. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model substantially reduces the root mean squared error in the estimation of carryover effects and immediate effects when compared to other existing methods, while being comparable in the estimation of the total effects. We also apply the proposed method to assess the extent of carryover effects of light therapies in relieving depressive symptoms in cancer survivors.",

        "Abstract": "Deprescribing has emerged as an important aspect of patient-centred medication management but is vastly underutilized in clinical practice. The current narrative review will describe an innovative patient-centred approach to deprescribing-N-of-1 trials. N-of-1 trials involve multiple-period crossover design experiments conducted within individual patients. They enable patients to compare the effects of two or more treatments or, in the case of deprescribing N-of-1 trials, continuation with a current treatment versus no treatment or placebo. N-of-1 trials are distinct from traditional between-patient studies such as parallel-group or crossover designs which provide an average effect across a group of patients and obscure differences between individuals. By generating data on the effect of an intervention for the individual rather than the population, N-of-1 trials can promote therapeutic precision. N-of-1 trials are a particularly appealing strategy to inform deprescribing because they can generate individual-level evidence for deprescribing when evidence is uncertain, and can thus allay patient and physician concerns about discontinuing medications. To illustrate the use of deprescribing N-of-1 trials, we share a case example of an ongoing series of N-of-1 trials that compare maintenance versus deprescribing of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. By providing quantifiable data on patient-reported outcomes, promoting personalized pharmacotherapy, and facilitating shared decision making, N-of-1 trials represent a potentially transformative strategy to address polypharmacy.",

Despite this progress, a persistent gap remains between stated public health targets and achieved blood pressure control rates. Many factors may be important contributors to the gap between population hypertension control goals and currently observed control levels. Among them is the extent to which patients adhere to prescribed treatment. The goal of this scientific statement is to summarize the current state of knowledge of the contribution of medication nonadherence to the national prevalence of poor blood pressure control, methods for measuring medication adherence and their associated challenges, risk factors for antihypertensive medication nonadherence, and strategies for improving adherence to antihypertensive medications at both the individual and health system levels.",

        "Abstract": "The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends out-of-office blood pressure (BP) testing to exclude white coat hypertension prior to hypertension diagnosis. Despite improved availability and coverage of home and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (HBPM, ABPM), both are infrequently used to confirm diagnoses. We used the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) framework, a multi-step process for mapping barriers to theory-informed behavior change techniques, to develop a multi-component implementation strategy for increasing out-of-office BP testing for hypertension diagnosis. Informed by geographically diverse provider focus groups (n = 63) exploring barriers to out-of-office testing and key informant interviews (n = 12), a multi-disciplinary team (medicine, psychology, nursing) used rigorous mixed methods to develop, refine, locally adapt, and finalize intervention components. The purpose of this report is to describe the protocol of the Effects of a Multi-faceted intervention on Blood pRessure Actions in the primary Care Environment (EMBRACE) trial, a cluster randomized control trial evaluating whether a theory-informed multi-component strategy increased out-of-office testing for hypertension diagnosis.",

Understanding patient preferences may guide decision-making around disposition after TIAMS that can lead to higher patient satisfaction and adherence. Psychological distress, particularly a sense of vulnerability (eg, 'threat perception') is associated with adverse psychological outcomes following TIAMS and may influence patient disposition preference.

        "Abstract": "As many as 1 in 8 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the ACS, and ACS-induced PTSD may increase secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, prior studies have been small and underpowered to test plausible behavioral or biological mechanisms of the hypothesized PTSD-secondary CVD risk association. In this paper, we describe the design and methods of a large prospective observational cohort study to estimate the prognostic significance of ACS-induced PTSD, mechanisms for its association with CVD risk, and emergency department (ED) factors that may increase PTSD risk, in a cohort of patients evaluated for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the ED of a large, urban academic medical center.",

        "Abstract": "Experts have expressed concerns that patients with chronic conditions are being excessively excluded from cancer randomized clinical trials (RCTs), limiting generalizability. Accordingly, we queried clinicaltrials.gov to determine the extent to which patients with chronic conditions were excluded from phase III cancer trials, using National Cancer Institute-sponsored breast cancer RCTs as a test case. Two physicians independently coded for the presence of 19 prevalent chronic conditions within eligibility criteria. They also coded for exclusions based on performance status and vague criteria that could have broadly excluded patients with chronic conditions. The search identified 58 RCTs, initiated from 1993 to 2012. Overall, 88% of trials had at least one exclusion for a chronic condition, performance status, or vague criterion. The three most commonly excluded conditions were chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Our study demonstrated that patients with prevalent chronic conditions were commonly excluded from National Cancer Institute-sponsored RCTs.",

        "Abstract": "Depression is the leading cause of disability and a major cause of morbidity worldwide, with societal costs now upwards of 1 trillion dollars across the globe. Hence, extending current efforts to augment prevention outcomes is consistent with global public health interests. Although many prevention programs have been developed and have demonstrated efficacy, studies have yet to demonstrate that CBT is effective in preventing symptoms in populations at risk for developing depression induced by pharmacological substances. Using a randomized, controlled design, this pilot study reports on the feasibility and preliminary effects of a novel, guided symptom exposure augmented cognitive behavioral prevention intervention (GSE-CBT) in a sample diagnosed with Hepatitis C at risk for developing medication induced depression. Results demonstrated that the guided symptom exposure augmented CBT (GSE-CBT) was feasible in this population and was delivered with high integrity. Although not statistically different, we observed a pattern of lower depression levels in the GSE-CBT group versus those in the control group throughout. This pilot study demonstrates that a psychosocial prevention intervention is feasible for use in patients at risk for developing pharmacologically induced depression and that a guided symptom exposure augmented CBT protocol has the potential to prevent symptoms of depression that develop as a side effect to taking these medications. Results are preliminary and future studies should use larger samples and test the intervention in other populations.",

        "Title": "Measuring the multiple domains of medication nonadherence: findings from a Delphi survey of adherence experts.",
        "Abstract": "Consensus on a gold-standard measure of patient medication nonadherence has been elusive, in part because medication nonadherence involves multiple, distinct behaviors across three phases (initiation, implementation, and persistence). To assess these behaviors, multiple measurement approaches may be needed. The purpose of this study was to identify expert-recommended approaches to measuring nonadherence behaviors. Thirty medication nonadherence experts were e-mailed two consecutive surveys. In both, respondents rated their agreement with definitions of nonadherence behaviors and measurement approaches. In the second survey, respondents rated the suitability of each measurement approach for assessing each behavior and identified the optimal measurement approach for each behavior. Consensus was achieved for eight patient medication nonadherence behaviors: not filling initial prescription and not taking first dose (noninitiation); refilling prescription late, missing doses, taking extra doses, taking doses at wrong time, and improperly administering medication (incorrect implementation); and discontinuing medication early (nonpersistence). Consensus was achieved for seven measurement approaches: self-report, prescription fill data, pill count, drug levels, electronic drug monitoring (EDM), smart technology, and direct observation. Self-report questionnaires were most commonly rated \"at least somewhat suitable\" for measuring behaviors. EDM was rated as optimal for measuring missing doses, taking extra doses, and taking doses at the wrong time. Prescription fill data were rated as optimal for not filling initial prescription, refilling late, and discontinuing. Direct observation was rated as optimal for measuring improper administration. Suitable and optimal measurement approaches varied across nonadherence behaviors. Researchers should select the measurement approach best suited to assessing the behavior(s) targeted in their research.",

        "Abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) induced by life-threatening medical events has been associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes, but it is unclear whether early interventions to prevent the onset of PTSD after these events are efficacious. We conducted a systematic review to address this need. We searched six biomedical electronic databases from database inception to October 2018. Eligible studies used randomized designs, evaluated interventions initiated within 3 months of potentially traumatic medical events, included adult participants, and did not have high risk of bias. The 21 included studies (N = 4,486) assessed a heterogeneous set of interventions after critical illness (9), cancer diagnosis (8), heart disease (2), and cardiopulmonary surgery (2). Fourteen psychological, 2 pharmacological, and 5 other-type interventions were assessed. Four of the psychological interventions emphasizing cognitive behavioral therapy or meaning-making, 1 other-type palliative care intervention, and 1 pharmacological-only intervention (hydrocortisone administration) were efficacious at reducing PTSD symptoms relative to control. One early, in-hospital counseling intervention was less efficacious at lowering PTSD symptoms than an active control. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity prevented quantitative pooling of data. While several promising interventions were identified, strong evidence of efficacy for any specific early PTSD intervention after medical events is currently lacking.",

        "Abstract": "The enduring somatic threat (EST) model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to life-threatening medical events suggests that PTSD-like symptoms represent patients' sensitization to cues of ongoing threat in the body. In this article, we review research on the prevalence and consequences of such reactions in cardiovascular disease patients, discuss early tests of the EST model, and then report a new test of the EST model in 143 patients enrolled during their first acute coronary syndrome (ACS; i.e., non-ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina-colloquially, \"heart attack\"). Invasive coronary revascularization procedures are commonly used to reduce secondary ACS risk and may reduce patients' EST, as revascularized patients often report being \"cured.\" We assessed ACS patients' initial threat perceptions during emergency department (ED) evaluation and followed them for 1 month for PTSD symptoms (specific for ACS, by telephone). We compared PTSD symptoms in participants who were revascularized (n = 65), catheterized but not revascularized (n = 35), and medically managed (n = 43). PTSD symptoms were lower for revascularized versus medically managed participants (B = -5.32, 95% confidence interval [-9.77, -0.87]), t(98.19) = -2.37, p = .020. In a multiple regression model adjusted for clinical and psychosocial covariates, the interaction of threat perception in the ED and ACS management group was significant (greater ED threat predicted greater 1-month PTSD symptoms only in medically managed participants). These findings offer further support for the EST model and suggest that psychological interventions to preempt patients' development of EST should be considered in the hospital.

        "Abstract": "Background Obtaining out-of-clinic blood pressure ( BP ) measurements to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension is recommended before initiating treatment. There are few empiric data available on the number of measurements required to reliably estimate BP on home BP monitoring ( HBPM ). Methods and Results We analyzed data from 316 community-dwelling adults not taking antihypertensive medication from the IDH (Improving the Detection of Hypertension) study who performed HBPM for 14 days. The reliability of home BP measurements was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient and as the percentage of participants with an absolute difference in home BP <10 mm Hg between weeks. The reliability of home hypertension status was assessed by the κ statistic. In the IDH study, 13.6% of participants had clinic hypertension and 18.0% had home hypertension. Mean home systolic and diastolic BP exhibited excellent reliability and sufficient agreement using the average of 2 morning and 2 evening BP readings for a minimum of 2 days of HBPM and a single morning and single evening or 2 morning BP readings for a minimum of 3 days. For diagnosing home hypertension, there was good agreement with a minimum of 3 days of HBPM using the average of 2 morning and 2 evening measurements or a single morning and single evening BP reading. A greater number of days was required for the other HBPM strategies. Conclusions Using the average of morning and evening readings, 3 days of HBPM are needed to reliably estimate mean home BP and diagnose out-of-clinic hypertension.",

        "Abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after acute medical events is associated with medication nonadherence. The mechanisms of PTSD-related nonadherence are poorly understood. We tested whether patients with elevated PTSD symptoms induced by suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were more likely to have aversive cognitions towards cardiovascular medications. We enrolled a consecutive cohort of patients who presented to the emergency department with suspected ACS. One month after discharge, ACS-induced PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Checklist (PCL-S), and patients were asked \"how often did\" (1) \"you miss your heart medication because you did not want to be reminded about your heart problem\"; (2) \"thinking about your heart medication make you feel nervous or anxious\"; and (3) \"thinking about your heart medication make you think about your risk for future heart problems.\" Logistic regression was used to determine the association between elevated PTSD symptoms and each aversive cognition, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, depression, and ACS status. Of 424 patients included, 15.8% had elevated PTSD symptoms (PCL-S ≥ 34). In adjusted analyses, higher PCL-S scores were associated with missing medications to avoid reminders of heart disease (OR 1.22 per 5-point PCL-S increase, 95%CI 1.07-1.40), as well as anxiety (OR 1.34, 95%CI 1.19-1.51) and thoughts of future risk (OR 1.19, 95%CI 1.08-1.32) when thinking about cardiovascular medications. We concluded that patients with elevated PTSD symptoms following suspected ACS were more likely to report aversive cognitions about their cardiovascular medications, suggesting that medications can act as traumatic reminders of the cardiac event and ongoing risk in this group.",

        "Abstract": "Medication nonadherence contributes to morbidity/mortality, but adherence interventions yield small and inconsistent effects. Understanding the mechanisms underlying initiation and maintenance of adherence could improve interventions. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) support adherence research, but it is unclear whether existing NIH-funded research incorporates mechanisms. We conducted a systematic review to determine the proportion of NIH-funded adherence trials that have tested hypothesized mechanisms of intervention effects. We included randomized and quasi-randomized NIH-funded trials with medication adherence in adults as the primary outcome. Studies were identified by searching electronic databases from inception to 6/2016, references, and clinicaltrials.gov. Two of 18 (11%) NIH-funded trials tested a hypothesized mechanism of an intervention's effect on medication adherence. Another 44 studies with medication adherence as a secondary outcome were described in protocol form, and are either ongoing or never published results, but none mentioned mechanism tests. Overall, 3% of NIH-funded trials with adherence as an outcome conducted, or plan to conduct, tests of behavior change mechanisms. These results mirror previous findings that very few studies of behavior change interventions actually test the mechanism by which the intervention is hypothesized to improve health behaviors. We must understand mechanisms if we are to improve the effectiveness of interventions.",

        "Abstract": "In 2015, the US Preventive Services Task Force updated their hypertension recommendations to advise that adults with elevated office blood pressure (BP) undergo out-of-office BP measurement to exclude white coat hypertension before diagnosis. Our goal was to determine the most important barriers to primary care providers' ordering ambulatory and home BP monitoring in the United States. We enrolled 63 primary care providers into nominal group panels in which participants iteratively listed and ranked barriers to ambulatory and home BP monitoring. Top-ranked barriers to ambulatory BP monitoring were challenges in accessing testing, costs of testing, concerns about the willingness or ability of patients to successfully complete tests, and concerns about the accuracy and benefits of testing. Top-ranked barriers to home BP monitoring were concerns about compliance with the correct test protocol, accuracy of tests results, out-of-pocket costs of home BP devices, and time needed to instruct patients on home BP monitoring protocol. Efforts to increase the use of ambulatory and home BP monitoring by primary care providers in the United States should prioritize increasing the financial and personnel resources available for testing and addressing provider concerns about patients' ability to conduct high-quality tests.",

        "Title": "Trends in Antihypertensive Medication Discontinuation and Low Adherence Among Medicare Beneficiaries Initiating Treatment From 2007 to 2012.",
        "Abstract": "Low antihypertensive medication adherence is common. During recent years, the impact of low medication adherence on increased morbidity and healthcare costs has become more recognized, leading to interventions aimed at improving adherence. We analyzed a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries initiating antihypertensive medication between 2007 and 2012 to assess whether reductions occurred in discontinuation and low adherence. Discontinuation was defined as having no days of antihypertensive medication supply for the final 90 days of the 365 days after initiation. Low adherence was defined as having a proportion of days covered <80% during the 365 days after initiation among beneficiaries who did not discontinue treatment. Between 2007 and 2012, 41 135 Medicare beneficiaries in the 5% sample initiated antihypertensive medication. Discontinuation was stable during the study period (21.0% in 2007 and 21.3% in 2012; P-trend=0.451). Low adherence decreased from 37.4% in 2007 to 31.7% in 2012 (P-trend<0.001). After multivariable adjustment, the relative risk of low adherence for beneficiaries initiating treatment in 2012 versus in 2007 was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.92). Low adherence was more common among racial/ethnic minorities, beneficiaries with Medicaid buy-in (an indicator of low income), and those with polypharmacy, and was less common among females, beneficiaries initiating antihypertensive medication with multiple classes or a 90-day prescription fill, with dementia, a history of stroke, and those who reached the Medicare Part D coverage gap in the previous year. In conclusion, low adherence to antihypertensive medication has decreased among Medicare beneficiaries; however, rates of discontinuation and low adherence remain high.",

        "Title": "The Association Between Antihypertensive Medication Nonadherence and Visit-to-Visit Variability of Blood Pressure: Findings From the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial.",
        "Abstract": "Low adherence to antihypertensive medication has been hypothesized to increase visit-to-visit variability (VVV) of blood pressure (BP). We assessed the association between antihypertensive medication adherence and VVV of BP in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). VVV of BP was calculated using SD independent of mean, SD, and average real variability across study visits conducted 6 to 28 months after randomization. Participants who reported taking <80% of their antihypertensive medication at ≥1 study visits were categorized as nonadherent. Participants were followed up for cardiovascular events and mortality after the assessment of adherence and VVV of BP. SD independent of mean of BP was higher for nonadherent (n=2912) versus adherent (n=16 878) participants; 11.4±4.9 versus 10.5±4.5 for systolic BP; 6.8±2.8 versus 6.2±2.6 for diastolic BP (each P<0.001). SD independent of mean of BP remained higher among nonadherent than among adherent participants after multivariable adjustment (0.8 [95% confidence interval, 0.7-1.0] higher for systolic BP and 0.4 [95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.5] higher for diastolic BP]. SD and average real variability of systolic BP and diastolic BP were also higher among nonadherent than among adherent participants. Adjustment for nonadherence did not explain the association of VVV of BP with higher fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or mortality risk. In conclusion, improving medication adherence may lower VVV of BP. However, VVV of BP is associated with cardiovascular outcomes independent of medication adherence.",

        "Abstract": "Primary care providers are increasingly involved in the management of patients with mental disorders, particularly as integrated models of care emerge. The recent publication of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) represents a shift in the classification of several mental disorders commonly encountered by primary care providers. With the advent of ICD-10 and the movement toward diagnostic specificity, it is crucial that primary care providers understand the rationale behind these changes. This paper provides an overview of the changes in the classification of mental disorders in DSM-5, a description of how these changes relate to frequently used screening tools in the primary care setting, and a critique of how these changes will affect mental health practice from a primary care perspective.",

        "Abstract": "The notion that psychological states can influence physical health is hardly new, and perhaps nowhere has the mind-body connection been better studied than in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recently, large prospective epidemiologic studies and smaller basic science studies have firmly established a connection between CVD and several psychological conditions, including depression, chronic psychological stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety. In addition, numerous clinical trials have been conducted to attempt to prevent or lessen the impact of these conditions on cardiovascular health. In this article, we review studies connecting depression, stress/PTSD, and anxiety to CVD, focusing on findings from the last 5 years. For each mental health condition, we first examine the epidemiologic evidence establishing a link with CVD. We then describe studies of potential underlying mechanisms and finally discuss treatment trials and directions for future research.",

Self-report questionnaires (SRQs), by contrast, are inexpensive, easy to administer, and hence, may be useful for 'diagnosing' nonadherence. In this study, we evaluated the validity of two commonly used medication adherence SRQs among patients with uncontrolled hypertension, using electronic pillbox measurement as the gold standard.",

        "Title": "A test of the diathesis-stress model in the emergency department: who develops PTSD after an acute coronary syndrome?",
        "Abstract": "Most acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients first present to the emergency department (ED). Patients who present to overcrowded EDs develop more posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms due to the ACS than do patients who present to less crowded EDs, but no research has indicated whether some patients may be more vulnerable to the effects of ED crowding than others. In an observational cohort study, we tested whether depressed patients developed more ACS-induced PTSD symptoms under conditions of ED overcrowding than patients who had never been depressed. We conducted psychiatric interviews for current and past depression in 189 ACS patients admitted through the ED within a week of hospitalization, and screened for PTSD symptoms 1 month later using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised. The sum of ED admissions for the 12 h prior to and 12 h after each participant's admission was categorized into tertiles for analysis. In a 3 (ED crowding tertile) by 3 (never, past, current depression) analysis of covariance adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, we found significant effects for ED crowding, depression status, and their interaction (all p's < .05). Mean PTSD scores were significantly higher (p = .005) for participants who were currently depressed and were treated during times of high ED crowding [25.38, 95% CI = 16.18-34.58], or had a history of depression [10.74, 95% CI = 6.86-14.62], relative to all other participants, who scored 5.6 or less. These results suggest that depressed ACS patients may be most vulnerable to the stress-inducing effects of ED crowding.",

        "Abstract": "Perceptions that stress causes and stress-reduction controls hypertension have been associated with poorer blood pressure (BP) control in hypertension populations. The current study investigated these \"stress-model perceptions\" in stroke survivors regarding prevention of recurrent stroke and the influence of these perceptions on patients' stroke risk factor control. Stroke and transient ischemic attack survivors (N=600) participated in an in-person interview in which they were asked about their beliefs regarding control of future stroke; BP and cholesterol were measured directly after the interview. Counter to expectations, patients who endorsed a \"stress-model\" but not a \"medication-model\" of stroke prevention were in better control of their stroke risk factors (BP and cholesterol) than those who endorsed a medication-model but not a stress-model of stroke prevention (OR for poor control=.54, Wald statistic=6.07, p=.01). This result was not explained by between group differences in patients' reported medication adherence. The results have implications for theory and practice, regarding the role of stress belief models and acute cardiac events, compared to chronic hypertension.",

Finding novel methods to help patients improve their adherence to existing evidence-based cardiovascular drug therapies has enormous potential to improve health outcomes while potentially reducing health care costs. The goal of this report is to provide a review of the current understanding of adherence to cardiovascular medications from the point of view of prescribing clinicians and cardiovascular researchers. Key topics addressed include: (1) definitions of medication adherence; (2) prevalence and impact of non-adherence; (3) methods for assessing medication adherence; 4) reasons for poor adherence; and 5) approaches to improving adherence to cardiovascular medications. For each of these topics, the report seeks to identify important gaps in knowledge and opportunities for advancing the field of cardiovascular adherence research.",

        "Abstract": "The authors' objective was to gain a better understanding of minority patients' beliefs about hypertension and to use this understanding to develop a model to explain gaps in communication between patients and clinicians. Eighty-eight hypertensive black and Latino adults from 4 inner-city primary care clinics participated in focus groups to elucidate views on hypertension. Participants believed that hypertension was a serious illness in need of treatment. Participants' diverged from the medical model in their beliefs about the time-course of hypertension (believed hypertension was intermittent); causes of hypertension (believed stress, racism, pollution, and poverty were the important causes); symptoms of hypertension (believed hypertension was primarily present when symptomatic); and treatments for hypertension (preferred alternative treatments that reduced stress over prescription medications). Participants distrusted clinicians who prioritized medications that did not directly address their understanding of the causes or symptoms of hypertension. Patients' models of understanding chronic asymptomatic illnesses such as hypertension challenge the legitimacy of lifelong, pill-centered treatment. Listening to patients' beliefs about hypertension may increase trust, improve communication, and encourage better self-management of hypertension.",

        "Abstract": "Among patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), depression is highly prevalent and is associated with worse cardiovascular prognosis and lower quality of life. Treatments for depression in CVD patients produce modest, but clinically significant reductions in depressive symptoms and show promise for improving cardiovascular prognosis. While tricyclics should generally be avoided, antidepressants from multiple other classes appear to be safe in cardiac patients. A strategy of engaging patients in choosing medications or psychotherapy and then intensifying treatment to therapeutic goal appears to be more effective at reducing depression than single mode interventions. Recommendations for screening all CVD patients for depression may be premature given increased costs associated with screening and gaps in knowledge about the risk-benefit ratio of depression treatment in mild and moderately depressed patients.",

        "Abstract": "Approximately 15% of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to their ACS event. We assessed whether ACS-induced PTSD symptoms increase risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and all-cause mortality (ACM) in an observational cohort study of 247 patients (aged 25-93 years; 45% women) hospitalized for an ACS at one of 3 academic medical centers in New York and Connecticut between November 2003 and June 2005. Within 1 week of admission, patient demographics, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score, Charlson comorbidity index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and depression status were obtained. At 1-month follow-up, ACS-induced PTSD symptoms were assessed with the Impact of Events Scale-Revised. The primary endpoint was combined MACE (hospitalization for myocardial infarction, unstable angina or urgent/emergency coronary revascularization procedures) and ACM, which were actively surveyed for 42 months after index event. Thirty-six (15%) patients had elevated intrusion symptoms, 32 (13%) elevated avoidance symptoms, and 21 (9%) elevated hyperarousal symptoms. Study physicians adjudicated 21 MACEs and 15 deaths during the follow-up period. In unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, and analyses adjusted for sex, age, clinical characteristics and depression, high intrusion symptoms were associated with the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-9.02; p = .015). Avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms were not associated with the primary endpoint. The presence of intrusion symptoms is a strong and independent predictor of elevated risk for MACE and ACM, and should be considered in the risk stratification of ACS patients.",

        "Abstract": "Although depression is clearly associated with increased mortality after acute myocardial infarction, there is a paucity of data examining the impact of depression on patients with unstable angina (UA). We analyzed the relation between depressive symptoms and all-cause mortality in patients with UA who were enrolled in a prospective multicenter study of depression and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) within 1 week of the ACS event, and patients were selected for a BDI score 0 to 4 or ≥ 10. Our sample included 209 patients with UA, with 104 (50%) having a BDI score ≥ 10. Proportional hazards analyses adjusted for variables including left ventricular ejection fraction, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score, and Charlson co-morbidity index. In multivariable analyses, a BDI score ≥ 10 was associated with increased risk of 42-month all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 3.46, p = 0.008) compared to a BDI score 0 to 4. In conclusion, our results confirm and extend previous evidence linking depression to worse outcomes in UA and suggest that interventions that address depression may be worth examining across the spectrum of risk in ACS.",

        "Abstract": "Persistent elevation of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) has been associated with an increased risk of recurrent cardiac events after acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Conflicting evidence is available regarding whether aspirin can reduce CRP after ACS. We investigated whether the dosage and adherence to aspirin was associated with the CRP level 3 months after ACS. Adherence to aspirin was monitored for 3 months in a cohort of 105 patients enrolled within 1 week of an ACS using an electronic chip stored in the pill bottle cap. The CRP level was measured at baseline and 3 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to test whether poor adherence to aspirin and a lower aspirin dosage were associated with increased CRP levels, controlling for age, ACS type, disease co-morbidity, baseline CRP level, use of clopidogrel and statins, depressive symptoms, smoking, and adherence to other medications. Aspirin adherence was inversely correlated with the CRP level at 3 months (Spearman's r = -0.36, p < 0.001). In the adjusted model, every 10% decrease in aspirin adherence was associated with a 1.7 increased risk (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.4) of a CRP level of ≥ 3.0 mg/L at 3 months. Low-dose aspirin was associated with a 7.1 increased risk (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 33.3) of a CRP level of ≥ 3.0 mg/L. The Charlson co-morbidity index, depressive symptoms, and baseline CRP level were also predictive of a CRP level of ≥ 3.0 mg/L at 3 months. The association between aspirin adherence and CRP level was not attenuated by controlling for other risk-reducing behaviors. In conclusion, a strong association was found between aspirin adherence and the CRP level after an ACS.",

We assessed a) whether depression was associated with the most comprehensive empirically derived index of clinical mortality predictors: the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score for predicting 6-month mortality after discharge for ACS; and b) whether depression remained an independent predictor of all-cause mortality after adjustment for the GRACE score and left ventricular dysfunction.",
