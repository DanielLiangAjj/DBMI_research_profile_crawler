        "Abstract": "Proper neurological function in humans requires precise control of levels of the epigenetic regulator methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 protein levels are low in fetal brains, where the predominant MECP2 transcripts have an unusually long 3' untranslated region (UTR). Here, we show that miR-483-5p, an intragenic microRNA of the imprinted IGF2, regulates MeCP2 levels through a human-specific binding site in the MECP2 long 3' UTR. We demonstrate the inverse correlation of miR-483-5p and MeCP2 levels in developing human brains and fibroblasts from Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome patients. Importantly, expression of miR-483-5p rescues abnormal dendritic spine phenotype of neurons overexpressing human MeCP2. In addition, miR-483-5p modulates the levels of proteins of the MeCP2-interacting corepressor complexes, including HDAC4 and TBL1X. These data provide insight into the role of miR-483-5p in regulating the levels of MeCP2 and interacting proteins during human fetal development.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors control eukaryotic cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism through their specific gene regulatory networks. However, differently from transcription factors, our understanding of the processes regulated by miRNAs is currently limited. Here, we introduce gene network analysis as a new means for gaining insight into miRNA biology. A systematic analysis of all human miRNAs based on Co-expression Meta-analysis of miRNA Targets (CoMeTa) assigns high-resolution biological functions to miRNAs and provides a comprehensive, genome-scale analysis of human miRNA regulatory networks. Moreover, gene cotargeting analyses show that miRNAs synergistically regulate cohorts of genes that participate in similar processes. We experimentally validate the CoMeTa procedure through focusing on three poorly characterized miRNAs, miR-519d/190/340, which CoMeTa predicts to be associated with the TGFβ pathway. Using lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells as a model system, we show that miR-519d and miR-190 inhibit, while miR-340 enhances TGFβ signaling and its effects on cell proliferation, morphology, and scattering. Based on these findings, we formalize and propose co-expression analysis as a general paradigm for second-generation procedures to recognize bona fide targets and infer biological roles and network communities of miRNAs.",

        "Abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are the most abundant class of small RNAs in mammals. They play an important role in regulation of gene expression by inducing mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition. Each miRNA targets an average of 100-200 genes by binding, preferentially, to their 3' UTRs by means of partial sequence complementarity. Most miRNAs are localized within transcriptional units, termed host genes, and show similar expression behavior with respect to their corresponding host genes. Considering the impact of miRNA in the regulation of gene expression and their involvement in a growing number of human disorders, it is vital to develop sensitive computational approaches able to identify miRNA target genes. The HOCTAR database (db) is a publicly available resource collecting ranked list of predicted target genes for 290 intragenic miRNAs annotated in human. HOCTARdb is a unique resource that integrates miRNA target prediction genes and transcriptomic data to score putative miRNA targets looking at the expression behavior of their host genes. We demonstrated, by testing 135 known validated target genes (either at the translational or transcriptional level) for different miRNAs, that the miRNA target prediction lists present in HOCTARdb are highly reliable. Moreover, HOCTARdb associates biological roles to each miRNA-controlled transcriptional network by means of Gene Ontology analysis. This information is easily accessible through a user-friendly query page. The HOCTARdb is available at http://hoctar.tigem.it/. We believe that a detailed relationship between miRNAs and their target genes and a constant update of the information contained in HOCTARdb will provide an extremely valuable resource to assist the researcher in the discovery of miRNA target genes.",

        "Abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNAs (19-25 nucleotides in length) processed from double-stranded hairpin precursors. They negatively regulate gene expression in animals, by binding, with imperfect base pairing, to target sites in messenger RNAs (usually in 3' untranslated regions) thereby either reducing translational efficiency or determining transcript degradation. Considering that each miRNA can regulate, on average, the expression of approximately several hundred target genes, the miRNA apparatus can participate in the control of the gene expression of a large quota of mammalian transcriptomes and proteomes. As a consequence, miRNAs are expected to regulate various developmental and physiological processes, such as the development and function of many tissue and organs. Due to the strong impact of miRNAs on the biological processes, it is expected that mutations affecting miRNA function have a pathogenic role in human genetic diseases, similar to protein-coding genes. In this review, we provide an overview of the evidence available to date which support the pathogenic role of miRNAs in human genetic diseases. We will first describe the main types of mutation mechanisms affecting miRNA function that can result in human genetic disorders, namely: (1) mutations affecting miRNA sequences; (2) mutations in the recognition sites for miRNAs harboured in target mRNAs; and (3) mutations in genes that participate in the general processes of miRNA processing and function. Finally, we will also describe the results of recent studies, mostly based on animal models, indicating the phenotypic consequences of miRNA alterations on the function of several tissues and organs. These studies suggest that the spectrum of genetic diseases possibly caused by mutations in miRNAs is wide and is only starting to be unravelled.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that control gene expression by inducing RNA cleavage or translational inhibition. Most human miRNAs are intragenic and are transcribed as part of their hosting transcription units. We hypothesized that the expression profiles of miRNA host genes and of their targets are inversely correlated and devised a novel procedure, HOCTAR (host gene oppositely correlated targets), which ranks predicted miRNA target genes based on their anti-correlated expression behavior relative to their respective miRNA host genes. HOCTAR is the first tool for systematic miRNA target prediction that utilizes the same set of microarray experiments to monitor the expression of both miRNAs (through their host genes) and candidate targets. We applied the procedure to 178 human intragenic miRNAs and found that it performs better than currently available prediction softwares in pinpointing previously validated miRNA targets. The high-scoring HOCTAR predicted targets were enriched in Gene Ontology categories, which were consistent with previously published data, as in the case of miR-106b and miR-93. By means of overexpression and loss-of-function assays, we also demonstrated that HOCTAR is efficient in predicting novel miRNA targets and we identified, by microarray and qRT-PCR procedures, 34 and 28 novel targets for miR-26b and miR-98, respectively. Overall, we believe that the use of HOCTAR significantly reduces the number of candidate miRNA targets to be tested compared to the procedures based solely on target sequence recognition. Finally, our data further confirm that miRNAs have a significant impact on the mRNA levels of most of their targets.",
