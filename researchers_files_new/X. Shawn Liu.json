        "Abstract": "Genetic studies of epigenetic modifiers such as DNA methyltransferases and histone acetyltransferases have revealed a critical role for epigenetic regulation during brain development and function. Alteration of epigenetic modifications have been documented in a variety of brain disorders, including neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases. Development of epigenome editing tools enables a functional dissection of the link between altered epigenetic changes and disease outcomes. Here, we review the development of epigenome editing tools, summarize proof of concept applications focusing on brain disease-associated genes, and discuss the promising application and challenges of epigenome editing to tackle brain disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic form of intellectual disability in males, is caused by silencing of the FMR1 gene associated with hypermethylation of the CGG expansion mutation in the 5' UTR of FMR1 in FXS patients. Here, we applied recently developed DNA methylation editing tools to reverse this hypermethylation event. Targeted demethylation of the CGG expansion by dCas9-Tet1/single guide RNA (sgRNA) switched the heterochromatin status of the upstream FMR1 promoter to an active chromatin state, restoring a persistent expression of FMR1 in FXS iPSCs. Neurons derived from methylation-edited FXS iPSCs rescued the electrophysiological abnormalities and restored a wild-type phenotype upon the mutant neurons. FMR1 expression in edited neurons was maintained in vivo after engrafting into the mouse brain. Finally, demethylation of the CGG repeats in post-mitotic FXS neurons also reactivated FMR1. Our data establish that demethylation of the CGG expansion is sufficient for FMR1 reactivation, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for FXS.",

        "Abstract": "Mammalian DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic mechanism orchestrating gene expression networks in many biological processes. However, investigation of the functions of specific methylation events remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that fusion of Tet1 or Dnmt3a with a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) enables targeted DNA methylation editing. Targeting of the dCas9-Tet1 or -Dnmt3a fusion protein to methylated or unmethylated promoter sequences caused activation or silencing, respectively, of an endogenous reporter. Targeted demethylation of the BDNF promoter IV or the MyoD distal enhancer by dCas9-Tet1 induced BDNF expression in post-mitotic neurons or activated MyoD facilitating reprogramming of fibroblasts into myoblasts, respectively. Targeted de novo methylation of a CTCF loop anchor site by dCas9-Dnmt3a blocked CTCF binding and interfered with DNA looping, causing altered gene expression in the neighboring loop. Finally, we show that these tools can edit DNA methylation in mice, demonstrating their wide utility for functional studies of epigenetic regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Although gemcitabine is the standard chemotherapeutic drug for treatment of pancreatic cancer, almost all patients eventually develop resistance to this agent. Previous studies identified Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) as the mediator of gemcitabine resistance, but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we show that Plk1 phosphorylation of Orc2 and Hbo1 mediates the resistance to gemcitabine. We show that the level of Plk1 expression positively correlates with gemcitabine resistance, both in pancreatic cancer cells and xenograft tumors. Overexpression of Plk1 increases gemcitabine resistance, while inhibition of Plk1 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine treatment. To validate our findings, we show that inhibition of Plk1 sensitizes tumors to gemcitabine treatment in a mouse xenograft study. Mechanistically, we find that Plk1 phosphorylation of Orc2 maintains DNA replication on gemcitabine treatment. Furthermore, Plk1 phosphorylation of Hbo1 transcriptionally increases cFos expression and consequently elevates its target multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1), which was previously reported to confer chemotherapeutic drug resistance. Knockdown of cFos or MDR1 sensitizes gemcitabine-resistant cells to gemcitabine treatment. Finally, pancreatic cancer cells expressing Plk1-unphosphorylatable mutants of Orc2 or Hbo1 are more sensitive to gemcitabine than cells expressing wild-type Orc2 or Hbo1. In short, our study provides a mechanism for Plk1-mediated gemcitabine resistance, suggesting that Plk1 is a promising target for treatment of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate chromosome segregation during cell division maintains genomic integrity and requires the proper establishment of kinetochore-microtubule attachment in mitosis. As a key regulator of mitosis, Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is essential for this attachment process, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here we identify Sgt1, a cochaperone for Hsp90, as a novel Plk1 substrate during mitosis. We show that Sgt1 dynamically localizes at the kinetochores, which lack microtubule attachments during prometaphase. Plk1 is required for the kinetochore localization of Sgt1 and phosphorylates serine 331 of Sgt1 at the kinetochores. This phosphorylation event enhances the association of the Hsp90-Sgt1 chaperone with the MIS12 complex to stabilize this complex at the kinetochores and thus coordinates the recruitment of the NDC80 complex to form efficient microtubule-binding sites. Disruption of Sgt1 phosphorylation reduces the MIS12 and NDC80 complexes at the kinetochores, impairs stable microtubule attachment, and eventually results in chromosome misalignment to delay the anaphase onset. Our results demonstrate a mechanism for Plk1 in promoting kinetochore-microtubule attachment to ensure chromosome stability.",

        "Abstract": "With new discoveries of important roles of phosphorylation on a daily basis, phospho-specific antibodies, as the primary tool for on-membrane detection of phosphoproteins, face enormous challenges. To address an urgent need for convenient and reliable analysis of phosphorylation events, we report a novel strategy for sensitive phosphorylation analysis in the Western blotting format. The chemical reagent, which we termed pIMAGO, is based on a multifunctionalized soluble nanopolymer and is capable of selectively binding to phosphorylated residues independent of amino acid microenvironment, thus offering great promise as a universal tool in biological analyses where the site of phosphorylation is not known or its specific antibody is not available. The specificity and sensitivity of the approach was first examined using a mixture of standard proteins. The method was then applied to monitor phosphorylation changes in in vitro kinase and phosphatase assays. Finally, to demonstrate the unique ability of pIMAGO to measure endogenous phosphorylation, we used it to visualize and determine the differences in phosphorylated proteins that interact with wild-type and kinase dead mutant of Polo-like kinase 1 during mitosis, the results of which were further confirmed by a quantitative phosphoproteomics experiment.",

It is well established that Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) plays critical roles in mitosis but little is known about its functions at other stages of the cell cycle.

Within the context of Plk1 phosphorylation of Orc2, we also emphasize regulation of Orc2 in different organisms.

In this study, we show that inhibition of Plk1 impairs DNA replication and results in slow S-phase progression in cultured cancer cells. We have identified origin recognition complex 2 (Orc2), a member of the DNA replication machinery, as a Plk1 substrate and have shown that Plk1 phosphorylates Orc2 at Ser188 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Orc2-S188 phosphorylation is enhanced when DNA replication is under challenge induced by ultraviolet, hydroxyurea, gemcitabine, or aphidicolin treatment. Cells expressing the unphosphorylatable mutant (S188A) of Orc2 had defects in DNA synthesis under stress, suggesting that this phosphorylation event is critical to maintain DNA replication under stress. To dissect the mechanism pertinent to this observation, we showed that Orc2-S188 phosphorylation associates with DNA replication origin and that cells expressing Orc2-S188A mutant fail to maintain the functional pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) under DNA replication stress. Furthermore, the intra-S-phase checkpoint is activated in Orc2-S188A-expressing cells to cause delay of S-phase progress. Our study suggests a novel role of Plk1 in facilitating DNA replication under conditions of stress to maintain genomic integrity.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal brain disease, but the pathogenesis of AD is still not understood. Aberrant cell-cycle re-entry of neuronal cells is emerging as a potential pathological mechanism in AD. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an established regulator of many cell cycle-related events. Interestingly, Plk1 is present in susceptible hippocampal and cortical neurons of AD patients but not age-matched controls. However, whether Plk1 is involved in the pathogenesis of AD remains elusive. In this study, we showed that Plk1 activity is elevated in AD patient brain as indicated by the increased phosphorylation signal of p150Glued, a Plk1-specific substrate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Plk1 is elevated during the cell-cycle re-entry of neuronal cells in an in vitro cell-culture model. Significantly, inhibition of Plk1 kinase activity or depletion of Plk1 by RNAi reduces β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced neuronal cell death. These results validate Plk1 as a possible target for AD therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Loss of the tumor suppressor Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is thought to mediate the majority of prostate cancers, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that Pten-depleted cells suffer from mitotic stress and that nuclear function of Pten, but not its phosphatase activity, is required to reverse this stress phenotype. Further, depletion of Pten results in elevated expression of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator of the cell cycle. We show that overexpression of Plk1 correlates with genetic inactivation of Pten during prostate neoplasia formation. Significantly, we find that elevated Plk1 is critical for Pten-depleted cells to adapt to mitotic stress for survival and that reintroduction of wild-type Pten into Pten-null prostate cancer cells reduces the survival dependence on Plk1. We further show that Plk1 confers the tumorigenic competence of Pten-deleted prostate cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model. These findings identify a role of Plk1 in facilitating loss of Pten-induced prostate cancer formation, which suggests that Plk1 might be a promising target for prostate cancer patients with inactivating Pten mutations.",

In this short review, we briefly summarized the well-established functions modulated by Plk1 during mitosis. Beyond mitosis, we focused mainly on the unexpected processes in which Plk1 emerges as a critical player, including microtubule dynamics, DNA replication, chromosome dynamics, p53 regulation, and recovery from the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint. Our discussion is mainly based on the critical substrates targeted by Plk1 during these cellular events and the functional significance associated with each phosphorylation event.",

        "Title": "Polo-like kinase 1 phosphorylation of p150Glued facilitates nuclear envelope breakdown during prophase.",
        "Abstract": "Nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) is an essential step during the G2/M transition in higher eukaryotic cells. Increasing evidence supports the notion that both microtubules and microtubule-associated motor proteins are critical regulators of NEBD. Although it has been described that p150(Glued), the major component of the dynein/dynactin complex, localizes in the nuclear envelope during prophase, the exact role of p150(Glued) and its regulation during NEBD are largely elusive. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), the best characterized Ser/Thr kinase, is involved in mitotic entry in several systems; however, the targets of Plk1 during NEBD are unknown. Herein, we show that in mammalian cells both Plk1 and p150(Glued) regulate NEBD and that Plk1 interacts with and phosphoryates p150(Glued) during NEBD at prophase. Using various approaches, we showed that Plk1 phosphorylates p150(Glued) at Ser-179 and that the pS179 epitope is generated at the nuclear envelope of prophase cells. Significantly, Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of p150(Glued) at Ser-179 positively regulates its accumulation at the nuclear envelope during prophase. Finally, we found that cells expressing the Plk1-unphosphorylatable mutant (p150(Glued)-S179A) arrest at G2, as indicated by reduced NEBD, increased levels of cyclin B and phospho-H3, but a decreased level of Cdc2 kinase activity. Taking these data together, we conclude that Plk1 phosphorylation of p150(Glued) might be one major pathway of NEBD regulation.",

Herein, we have identified polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and casein kinase 2 (CK2) as two kinases of CLIP-170 and mapped S195 and S1318 as their respective phosphorylation sites. We showed that a CK2 unphosphorylatable mutant lost its ability to bind to dynactin and to localize to kinetochores during prometaphase, indicating that the CK2 phosphorylation of CLIP-170 is involved in its dynactin-mediated kinetochore localization. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Plk1 phosphorylation of CLIP-170 at S195 enhances its association with CK2. Finally, we detected defects in the formation of kinetochore fibres in cells expressing the CLIP-S195A and -S1318A, but not the CLIP-S195E and -S1318D, confirming that Plk1- and CK2-associated phosphorylations of CLIP-170 are involved in the timely formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments in mitosis.",

Although it has been reported that CLIP-170 is a phosphoprotein, neither have individual phosphorylation sites been identified nor have the associated kinases been extensively studied. Herein, we identify Cdc2 as a kinase that phosphorylates CLIP-170. We show that Cdc2 interacts with CLIP-170 mediating its phosphorylation on Thr(287) in vivo. Significantly, expression of CLIP-170 with a threonine 287 to alanine substitution (T287A) results in its mislocalization, accumulation of Plk1 and cyclin B, and block of the G2/M transition. Finally, we found that depletion of CLIP-170 leads to centrosome reduplication and that Cdc2 phosphorylation of CLIP-170 is required for the process. These results demonstrate that Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of CLIP-170 is essential for the normal function of this protein during cell cycle progression.",

        "Abstract": "Xenopus laevis oocytes are popular cells in experimental biology. Fully grown oocytes are large (approximately 1.3-mm diameter) with an enormous nucleus (approximately 300-microm diameter). Oocytes are generally isolated by either manual dissection (manual defolliculation) or enzymatic (mainly with collagenase preparations) digestion of the extracellular connective tissues. In this chapter, we describe both procedures, which are routinely used in our laboratory. However, manual defolliculation does not actually remove the innermost layer of follicle cells, which are anchored to the vitelline membrane. To remove these follicle cells, further mechanical or enzymatic treatment is required. On the other hand, many have experienced nonspecific effects with collagenase-treated oocytes, including spontaneous oocyte maturation and reduced oocyte health. We discuss possible explanations and solutions to these problems. Finally, we also describe procedures we employ routinely to isolate oocyte nuclei and enucleated oocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Two forms of the classical progesterone receptors (PR), XPR-1 and XPR-2, have been cloned in Xenopus laevis. Their relative roles in mediating progesterone action in the ovaries are not clear. Using antibodies generated against the cloned XPR-2, we demonstrated here that the somatic follicle cells expressed an 80-kDa PR protein, termed XPR-1. Treatment of follicle cells with progesterone resulted in disappearance of this protein, consistent with proteosome-mediated XPR-1 protein degradation. A smaller (approximately 70 kDa) PR protein, termed XPR-2, was expressed in the oocytes, but not in follicle cells. XPR-2 underwent progesterone-induced phosphorylation but not protein degradation. Treating isolated ovarian fragments with progesterone caused oocyte maturation and the release of the mature oocytes from the ovarian tissues (\"ovulation\"). Inhibition of transcription, with actinomycin D, did not interfere with progesterone-induced oocyte maturation but blocked \"ovulation\" so that mature oocytes were trapped in the follicles. These results suggest that the dual functions of progesterone, transcription-dependent follicle rupture and transcription-independent oocyte maturation, are mediated by the two forms of PR proteins differentially expressed in the follicle cells and the oocytes, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence has indicated that vertebrate oocytes are arrested at late prophase (G2 arrest) by a G protein coupled receptor (GpCR) that activates adenylyl cyclases. However, the identity of this GpCR or its regulation in G2 oocytes is unknown. We demonstrated that ritanserin (RIT), a potent antagonist of serotonin receptors 5-HT2R and 5-HT7R, released G2 arrest in denuded frog oocytes, as well as in follicle-enclosed mouse oocytes. In contrast to RIT, several other serotonin receptor antagonists (mesulergine, methiothepine, and risperidone) had no effect on oocyte maturation. The unique ability of RIT, among serotonergic antagonists, to induce GVBD did not match the antagonist profile of any known serotonin receptors including Xenopus 5-HT7R, the only known G(s)-coupled serotonin receptor cloned so far in this species. Unexpectedly, injection of x5-HT7R mRNA in frog oocytes resulted in hormone-independent frog oocyte maturation. The addition of exogenous serotonin abolished x5-HT7R-induced oocyte maturation. Furthermore, the combination of x5-HT7R and exogenous serotonin potently inhibited progesterone-induced oocyte maturation. These results provide the first evidence that a G-protein coupled receptor related to 5-HT7R may play a pivotal role in maintaining G2 arrest in vertebrate oocytes.",
