        "Abstract": "The neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) homolog LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus has proven to be a valuable model for studying the transport mechanism of the NSS family. Crystal structures have captured LeuT in key conformations visited during the transport cycle, allowing for the construction of a nearly complete model of transport, with much of the conformational dynamics studied by computational simulations. Here, we report crystal structures of LeuT representing new intermediate conformations between the outward-facing open and occluded states. These structures, combined with binding and accessibility studies, reveal details of conformational dynamics that can follow substrate binding at the central substrate binding site (S1) of LeuT in outward-facing states, suggesting a potential competition for direction between the outward-open and outward-occluded states at this stage during substrate transport. Our structures further support an intimate interplay between the protonation state of Glu290 and binding of Na1 that may ultimately regulate the outward-open-to-occluded transition.",

        "Abstract": "The enantiomerically and diastereomerically pure tricyclic oxazolidine cis-10 was prepared in a five step synthesis starting with 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene. Me3SiCN and allylSiMe3 reacted with cis-10 in the presence of TiCl4 to form the nitrile (3S)-11 and the allyl derivative (3S)-12 with high diastereoselectivity. The hydrogenolytic removal of the chiral auxiliary failed, since the endocyclic benzyl-N-bond was cleaved simultaneously. Therefore the N-(hydroxyethyl)amide of (3S)-12 was transformed into the enamide 27, which was hydrolyzed to afford the secondary amide 28. The enamide strategy to remove the chiral auxiliary from (3S)-11 led to complete racemization due to fast deprotonation in Î±-position of the cyano moiety. Two pairs of enantiomers 30a-b/ent-30a-b with prototypical Ïƒ substituents at the N-atom were prepared. The low Ïƒ1 affinity of the tetrahydro-2-benzazepines (ent-30b, Ki = 407 nM) is attributed to the short distance between the two lipophilic aromatic moieties.",

        "Title": "Beyond non-integer Hill coefficients: A novel approach to analyzing binding data, applied to Na+-driven transporters.",
        "Abstract": "Prokaryotic and eukaryotic Na(+)-driven transporters couple the movement of one or more Na(+) ions down their electrochemical gradient to the active transport of a variety of solutes. When more than one Na(+) is involved, Na(+)-binding data are usually analyzed using the Hill equation with a non-integer exponent n. The results of this analysis are an overall Kd-like constant equal to the concentration of ligand that produces half saturation and n, a measure of cooperativity. This information is usually insufficient to provide the basis for mechanistic models. In the case of transport using two Na(+) ions, an n < 2 indicates that molecules with only one of the two sites occupied are present at low saturation. Here, we propose a new way of analyzing Na(+)-binding data for the case of two Na(+) ions that, by taking into account binding to individual sites, provides far more information than can be obtained by using the Hill equation with a non-integer coefficient: it yields pairs of possible values for the Na(+) affinities of the individual sites that can only vary within narrowly bounded ranges. To illustrate the advantages of the method, we present experimental scintillation proximity assay (SPA) data on binding of Na(+) to the Na(+)/I(-) symporter (NIS). SPA is a method widely used to study the binding of Na(+) to Na(+)-driven transporters. NIS is the key plasma membrane protein that mediates active I(-) transport in the thyroid gland, the first step in the biosynthesis of the thyroid hormones, of which iodine is an essential constituent. NIS activity is electrogenic, with a 2:1 Na(+)/I(-) transport stoichiometry. The formalism proposed here is general and can be used to analyze data on other proteins with two binding sites for the same substrate.",

        "Title": "Interaction of Î±-Lipoic Acid with the Human Na+/Multivitamin Transporter (hSMVT).",
        "Abstract": "The human Na(+)/multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) has been suggested to transport Î±-lipoic acid (LA), a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent used in therapeutic applications, e.g. in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and Alzheimer disease. However, the molecular basis of the cellular delivery of LA and in particular the stereospecificity of the transport process are not well understood. Here, we expressed recombinant hSMVT in Pichia pastoris and used affinity chromatography to purify the detergent-solubilized protein followed by reconstitution of hSMVT in lipid bilayers. Using a combined approach encompassing radiolabeled LA transport and equilibrium binding studies in conjunction with the stabilized R-(+)- and S-(-)-enantiomers and the R,S-(+/-) racemic mixture of LA or lipoamide, we identified the biologically active form of LA, R-LA, to be the physiological substrate of hSMVT. Interaction of R-LA with hSMVT is strictly dependent on Na(+). Under equilibrium conditions, hSMVT can simultaneously bind ~2 molecules of R-LA in a biphasic binding isotherm with dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.9 and 7.4 Î¼m. Transport of R-LA in the oocyte and reconstituted system is exclusively dependent on Na(+) and exhibits an affinity of ~3 Î¼m. Measuring transport with known amounts of protein in proteoliposomes containing hSMVT in outside-out orientation yielded a catalytic turnover number (kcat) of about 1 s(-1), a value that is well in agreement with other Na(+)-coupled transporters. Our data suggest that hSMVT-mediated transport is highly specific for R-LA at our tested concentration range, a finding with wide ramifications for the use of LA in therapeutic applications.",

        "Title": "Mechanism of the Association between Na+ Binding and Conformations at the Intracellular Gate in Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporters.",
        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) terminate neurotransmission by Na(+)-dependent reuptake of released neurotransmitters. Previous studies suggested that Na(+)-binding reconfigures dynamically coupled structural elements in an allosteric interaction network (AIN) responsible for function-related conformational changes, but the intramolecular pathway of this mechanism has remained uncharted. We describe a new approach for the modeling and analysis of intramolecular dynamics in the bacterial NSS homolog LeuT. From microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations and cognate experimental verifications in both LeuT and human dopamine transporter (hDAT), we apply the novel method to identify the composition and the dynamic properties of their conserved AIN. In LeuT, two different perturbations disrupting Na(+) binding and transport (i.e. replacing Na(+) with Li(+) or the Y268A mutation at the intracellular gate) affect the AIN in strikingly similar ways. In contrast, other mutations that affect the intracellular gate (i.e. R5A and D369A) do not significantly impair Na(+) cooperativity and transport. Our analysis shows these perturbations to have much lesser effects on the AIN, underscoring the sensitivity of this novel method to the mechanistic nature of the perturbation. Notably, this set of observations holds as well for hDAT, where the aligned Y335A, R60A, and D436A mutations also produce different impacts on Na(+) dependence. Thus, the detailed AIN generated from our method is shown to connect Na(+) binding with global conformational changes that are critical for the transport mechanism. That the AIN between the Na(+) binding sites and the intracellular gate in bacterial LeuT resembles that in eukaryotic hDAT highlights the conservation of allosteric pathways underlying NSS function.",

        "Abstract": "The Na(+)/multivitamin transporter (SMVT) is a member of the solute:sodium symporter family that catalyzes the Na(+)-dependent uptake of the structurally diverse water-soluble vitamins pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and biotin (vitamin H), Î±-lipoic acid-a vitamin-like substance with strong antioxidant properties-and iodide. The organic substrates of SMVT play central roles in the cellular metabolism and are, therefore, essential for normal human health and development. For example, biotin deficiency leads to growth retardation, dermatological disorders, and neurological disorders. Animal studies have shown that biotin deficiency during pregnancy is directly correlated to embryonic growth retardation, congenital malformation, and death of the embryo. This chapter focuses on the structural and functional features of the human isoform of SMVT (hSMVT); the discovery of which was greatly facilitated by the cloning and expression of hSMVT in tractable expression systems. Special emphasis will be given to mechanistic implications of the transport process of hSMVT that will inform our understanding of the molecular determinants of hSMVT-mediated transport in dynamic context to alleviate the development and optimization of hSMVT as a multipotent platform for drug delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs) terminate synaptic signal transmission by Na+-dependent reuptake of released neurotransmitters. Key conformational states have been reported for the bacterial homolog LeuT and an inhibitor-bound Drosophila dopamine transporter. However, a coherent mechanism of Na+-driven transport has not been described. Here, we present two crystal structures of MhsT, an NSS member from Bacillus halodurans, in occluded inward-facing states with bound Na+ ions and L-tryptophan, providing insight into the cytoplasmic release of Na+. The switch from outward- to inward-oriented states is centered on the partial unwinding of transmembrane helix 5, facilitated by a conserved GlyX9Pro motif that opens an intracellular pathway for water to access the Na2 site. We propose a mechanism, based on our structural and functional findings, in which solvation through the TM5 pathway facilitates Na+ release from Na2 and the transition to an inward-open state.",

        "Abstract": "The leucine transporter (LeuT) from Aquifex aeolicus is a bacterial homolog of neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs) that catalyze reuptake of neurotransmitters at the synapse. Crystal structures of wild-type and mutants of LeuT have been interpreted as conformational states in the coupled transport cycle. However, the mechanistic identities inferred from these structures have not been validated, and the ligand-dependent conformational equilibrium of LeuT has not been defined. Here, we used distance measurements between spin-label pairs to elucidate Na(+)- and leucine-dependent conformational changes on the intracellular and extracellular sides of the transporter. The results identify structural motifs that underlie the isomerization of LeuT between outward-facing, inward-facing and occluded states. The conformational changes reported here present a dynamic picture of the alternating-access mechanism of LeuT and NSSs that is different from the inferences reached from currently available structural models.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) play a critical role in signaling by reuptake of neurotransmitters. Eukaryotic NSSs are chloride-dependent, whereas prokaryotic NSS homologs like LeuT are chloride-independent but contain an acidic residue (Glu290 in LeuT) at a site where eukaryotic NSSs have a serine. The LeuT-E290S mutant displays chloride-dependent activity. We show that, in LeuT-E290S cocrystallized with bromide or chloride, the anion is coordinated by side chain hydroxyls from Tyr47, Ser290, and Thr254 and the side chain amide of Gln250. The bound anion and the nearby sodium ion in the Na1 site organize a connection between their coordinating residues and the extracellular gate of LeuT through a continuous H-bond network. The specific insights from the structures, combined with results from substrate binding studies and molecular dynamics simulations, reveal an anion-dependent occlusion mechanism for NSS and shed light on the functional role of chloride binding.",

        "Abstract": "The Kv1 family voltage-dependent K(+) channels are essential for termination of action potentials in neurons and myocytes. These channels form a stable complex with their beta subunits (KvÎ²), some of which inhibit channel activity. Cortisone potentiates Kv1 channel by binding to KvÎ² and promoting its dissociation from the channel, but its half-maximum effective concentration is âˆ¼46 Î¼M. To identify corticosteroids that are more efficient than cortisone, we examined 25 cortisone analogues and found that fluticasone propionate potentiates channel current with a half-maximum effective concentration (EC(50)) of 37 Â± 1.1 nM. Further studies showed that fluticasone propionate potentiates channel current by inducing dissociation of KvÎ², and docking of fluticasone propionate into the cortisone binding site reveals potential interactions that enhance the EC(50) value. Thus, fluticasone propionate provides a starting point for rational design of more efficient small-molecule compounds that increase Kv1 activity and affect the integrity of the Kv1-KvÎ² complex.",

The crystal structure of the NSS homolog LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus revealed one leucine substrate in an occluded, centrally located (S1) binding site next to two Na(+) ions. Computational studies combined with binding and flux experiments identified a second substrate (S2) site and a molecular mechanism of Na(+)-substrate symport that depends upon the allosteric interaction of substrate molecules in the two high-affinity sites. Here we show that the S2 site, which has not yet been identified by crystallographic approaches, can be blocked during preparation of detergent-solubilized LeuT, thereby obscuring its crucial role in Na(+)-coupled symport. This finding points to the need for caution in selecting experimental environments in which the properties and mechanistic features of membrane proteins can be delineated.",

        "Abstract": "Helicobacter pylori's unique ability to colonize and survive in the acidic environment of the stomach is critically dependent on uptake of urea through the urea channel, HpUreI. Hence, HpUreI may represent a promising target for the development of specific drugs against this human pathogen. To obtain insight into the structure-function relationship of this channel, we developed conditions for the high-yield expression and purification of stable recombinant HpUreI. Detergent-solubilized HpUreI forms a homotrimer, as determined by chemical cross-linking. Urea dissociation kinetics of purified HpUreI were determined by means of the scintillation proximity assay, whereas urea efflux was measured in HpUreI-containing proteoliposomes using stopped-flow spectrometry to determine the kinetics and selectivity of the urea channel. The kinetic analyses revealed that urea conduction in HpUreI is pH-sensitive and saturable with a half-saturation concentration (or K(0.5)) of ~163 mM. The extent of binding of urea by HpUreI was increased at lower pH; however, the apparent affinity of urea binding (~150 mM) was not significantly pH-dependent. The solute selectivity analysis indicated that HpUreI is highly selective for urea and hydroxyurea. Removing either amino group of urea molecules diminishes their permeability through HpUreI. Similar to urea conduction, diffusion of water through HpUreI is pH-dependent with low water permeability at neutral pH.",

        "Title": "Conserved tyrosine in the first transmembrane segment of solute:sodium symporters is involved in Na+-coupled substrate co-transport.",
        "Abstract": "Solute:sodium symporters (SSSs) transport vital molecules across the plasma membrane of all living organisms. vSGLT, the Na(+)/galactose transporter of Vibrio parahemeolyticus, is the only SSS for which high resolution structural information is available, revealing a LeuT-like fold and a Na(+)-binding site analogous to the Na2 site of LeuT. Whereas the core transmembrane segments (TMs) of SSSs share high structural similarity with other transporters of LeuT-like fold, TM1 does not correspond to any TM in those structural homologs and was only resolved for the backbone atoms in the initial vSGLT structure (Protein Data Bank code 3DH4). To assess the role of TM1 in Na(+)-coupled substrate symport by the SSSs, here we have studied the role of a conserved residue in TM1 by computational modeling in conjunction with radiotracer transport and binding studies. Based on our sequence alignment and much topological data for homologous PutP, the Na(+)/proline transporter, we have simulated a series of vSGLT models with shifted TM1 residue assignments. We show that in two converged vSGLT models that retained the original TM1 backbone conformation, a conserved residue, Tyr-19, is associated with the Na(+) binding interaction network. In silico and in vitro mutagenesis of homologous Tyr-14 in PutP revealed the involvement of this conserved residue in Na(+)-dependent substrate binding and transport. Thus, our combined computational and experimental data provide the first clues about the importance of a conserved residue in TM1, a unique TM in the proteins with LeuT-like fold, in the Na(+)-coupled symport mechanism of SSSs.",

        "Title": "Surprising substrate versatility in SLC5A6: Na+-coupled I- transport by the human Na+/multivitamin transporter (hSMVT).",
        "Abstract": "Iodide (I(-)) is an essential constituent of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine, which are required for the development of the central nervous system in the fetus and newborn. I(-) uptake in the thyroid is mediated by the Na(+)/I(-) symporter (NIS). NIS has gained particular medical interest due to its sensitivity to the environmental pollutant perchlorate (ClO(4)(-)) and its implication in radioiodide cancer treatment. Recently, others have shown that I(-) absorption in the intestine is mediated by NIS (Nicola, J. P., Basquin, C., Portulano, C., Reyna-Neyra, A., Paroder, M., and Carrasco, N. (2009) Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 296, C654-662). However, their data suggest the participation of other systems in the homeostasis of I(-), in particular because in vivo uptake studies revealed a ClO(4)(-)-insensitive transport component. Here, we describe Na(+)-coupled I(-) uptake by the human Na(+)/multivitamin transporter (hSMVT), a related protein isolated from the placenta, where it was suggested to supply the fetus with the water-soluble vitamins biotin and pantothenic acid, and Î±-lipoic acid. hSMVT-mediated Na(+)/I(-) symport is inhibited by the other three organic hSMVT substrates but not by NIS substrates; notably, hSMVT is insensitive to ClO(4)(-). Because hSMVT is found in the intestine and in many other tissues, we propose that hSMVT may play an important role in the homeostasis of I(-) in the body.",

        "Abstract": "Crystallographic, computational and functional analyses of LeuT have revealed details of the molecular architecture of Na(+)-coupled transporters and the mechanistic nature of ion/substrate coupling, but the conformational changes that support a functional transport cycle have yet to be described fully. We have used site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis to capture the dynamics of LeuT in the region of the extracellular vestibule associated with the binding of Na(+) and leucine. The results outline the Na(+)-dependent formation of a dynamic outward-facing intermediate that exposes the primary substrate binding site and the conformational changes that occlude this binding site upon subsequent binding of the leucine substrate. Furthermore, the binding of the transport inhibitors tryptophan, clomipramine and octyl-glucoside is shown to induce structural changes that distinguish the resulting inhibited conformation from the Na(+)/leucine-bound state.",

        "Title": "Structure-function studies of the SLC17 transporter sialin identify crucial residues and substrate-induced conformational changes.",
        "Abstract": "Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disorder are human diseases caused by loss of function of sialin, a lysosomal transporter that mediates H(+)-coupled symport of acidic sugars N-acetylneuraminic acid and glucuronic acid out of lysosomes. Along with the closely related vesicular glutamate transporters, sialin belongs to the SLC17 transporter family. Despite their critical role in health and disease, these proteins remain poorly understood both structurally and mechanistically. Here, we use substituted cysteine accessibility screening and radiotracer flux assays to evaluate experimentally a computationally generated three-dimensional structure model of sialin. According to this model, sialin consists of 12 transmembrane helices (TMs) with an overall architecture similar to that of the distantly related glycerol 3-phosphate transporter GlpT. We show that TM4 in sialin lines a large aqueous cavity that forms a part of the substrate permeation pathway and demonstrate substrate-induced alterations in accessibility of substituted cysteine residues in TM4. In addition, we demonstrate that one mutant, F179C, has a dramatically different effect on the apparent affinity and transport rate for N-acetylneuraminic acid and glucuronic acid, suggesting that it may be directly involved in substrate recognition and/or translocation. These findings offer a basis for further defining the transport mechanism of sialin and other SLC17 family members.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter-sodium symporters (NSS), targets for psychostimulants and therapeutic drugs, have a critical role in neurotransmission. Whereas eukaryotic NSS show chloride-dependent transport, bacterial NSS feature Cl(-)-independent substrate transport. Recently we showed that mutation of an acidic residue near one of the sodium ion-binding sites in LeuT of Aquifex aeolicus or Tyt1 of Fusobacterium nucleatum renders substrate binding and/or transport Cl(-) dependent. We reasoned that the negative charge--provided either by Cl(-) or by the transporter itself--is required for substrate translocation. Here we show that Tyt1 reconstituted in proteoliposomes is strictly dependent on the Na(+) gradient and is stimulated by an inside negative membrane potential and by an inversely oriented proton gradient. Notably, Na(+)/substrate symport elicited H(+) efflux, indicative of Na(+)/substrate symport-coupled H(+) antiport. Mutations that render the transport phenotype Cl(-) dependent essentially abolish the pH dependence. We propose unifying features of charge balance by all NSS members with similar mechanistic features but different molecular solutions.",

Free diffusion of urea across cell membranes is slow owing to its high polarity, and specialized urea transporters have evolved to achieve rapid and selective urea permeation. Here we present the 2.3 A structure of a functional urea transporter from the bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris. The transporter is a homotrimer, and each subunit contains a continuous membrane-spanning pore formed by the two homologous halves of the protein. The pore contains a constricted selectivity filter that can accommodate several dehydrated urea molecules in single file. Backbone and side-chain oxygen atoms provide continuous coordination of urea as it progresses through the filter, and well-placed alpha-helix dipoles provide further compensation for dehydration energy. These results establish that the urea transporter operates by a channel-like mechanism and reveal the physical and chemical basis of urea selectivity.",

        "Abstract": "The first crystal structure of the neurotransmitter/sodium symporter homolog LeuT revealed an occluded binding pocket containing leucine and 2 Na(+); later structures showed tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in an extracellular vestibule approximately 11 A above the bound leucine and 2 Na(+). We recently found this region to be a second binding (S2) site and that binding of substrate to this site triggers Na(+)-coupled substrate symport. Here, we show a profound inhibitory effect of n-octyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (OG), the detergent used for LeuT crystallization, on substrate binding to the S2 site. In parallel, we determined at 2.8 A the structure of LeuT-E290S, a mutant that, like LeuT-WT, binds 2 substrate molecules. This structure was similar to that of WT and clearly revealed an OG molecule in the S2 site. We also observed electron density at the S2 site in LeuT-WT crystals, and this also was accounted for by an OG molecule in that site. Computational analyses, based on the available crystal structures of LeuT, indicated the nature of structural arrangements in the extracellular region of LeuT that differentiate the actions of substrates from inhibitors bound in the S2 site. We conclude that the current LeuT crystal structures, all of which have been solved in OG, represent functionally blocked forms of the transporter, whereas a substrate bound in the S2 site will promote a different state that is essential for Na(+)-coupled symport.",

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs), targets for antidepressants and psychostimulants, terminate neurotransmission by sodium-driven reuptake. The crystal structure of LeuT(Aa), a prokaryotic NSS homolog, revealed an occluded state in which one leucine and two Na(+) ions are bound, but provided limited clues to the molecular mechanism of transport. Using steered molecular dynamics simulations, we explored the substrate translocation pathway of LeuT. We identified a second substrate binding site located in the extracellular vestibule comprised of residues shown recently to participate in binding tricyclic antidepressants. Binding and flux experiments showed that the two binding sites can be occupied simultaneously. The substrate in the secondary site allosterically triggers intracellular release of Na(+) and substrate from the primary site, thereby functioning as a \"symport effector.\" Because tricyclic antidepressants bind differently to this secondary site, they do not promote substrate release from the primary site and thus act as symport uncouplers and inhibit transport.",

        "Title": "Mechanism of chloride interaction with neurotransmitter:sodium symporters.",
        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS) have a critical role in regulating neurotransmission and are targets for psychostimulants, anti-depressants and other drugs. Whereas the non-homologous glutamate transporters mediate chloride conductance, in the eukaryotic NSS chloride is transported together with the neurotransmitter. In contrast, transport by the bacterial NSS family members LeuT, Tyt1 and TnaT is chloride independent. The crystal structure of LeuT reveals an occluded binding pocket containing leucine and two sodium ions, and is highly relevant for the neurotransmitter transporters. However, the precise role of chloride in neurotransmitter transport and the location of its binding site remain elusive. Here we show that introduction of a negatively charged amino acid at or near one of the two putative sodium-binding sites of the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) transporter GAT-1 from rat brain (also called SLC6A1) renders both net flux and exchange of GABA largely chloride independent. In contrast to wild-type GAT-1, a marked stimulation of the rate of net flux, but not of exchange, was observed when the internal pH was lowered. Equivalent mutations introduced in the mouse GABA transporter GAT4 (SLC6A11) and the human dopamine transporter DAT (SLC6A3) also result in chloride-independent transport, whereas the reciprocal mutations in LeuT and Tyt1 render substrate binding and/or uptake by these bacterial NSS chloride dependent. Our data indicate that the negative charge, provided either by chloride or by the transporter itself, is required during binding and translocation of the neurotransmitter, probably to counterbalance the charge of the co-transported sodium ions.",

        "Abstract": "Transport proteins constitute approximately 10% of most proteomes and play vital roles in the translocation of solutes across membranes of all organisms. Their (dys)function is implicated in many disorders, making them frequent targets for pharmacotherapy. The identification of substrates for members of this large protein family, still replete with many orphans of unknown function, has proven difficult, in part because high-throughput screening is greatly complicated by endogenous transporters present in many expression systems. In addition, direct structural studies require that transporters be extracted from the membrane with detergent, thereby precluding transport measurements because of the lack of a vectorial environment and necessitating reconstitution into proteoliposomes for activity measurements. Here, we describe a direct scintillation proximity-based radioligand-binding assay for determining transport protein function in crude cell extracts and in purified form. This rapid and universally applicable assay with advantages over cell-based platforms will greatly facilitate the identification of substrates for many orphan transporters and allows monitoring the function of transport proteins in a nonmembranous environment.",

        "Abstract": "The gene of a novel prokaryotic member (Tyt1) of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family has been cloned from Fusobacterium nucleatum. In contrast to eukaryotic and some prokaryotic NSSs, which contain 12 transmembrane domains (TMs), Tyt1 contains only 11 TMs, a characteristic shared by approximately 70% of prokaryotic NSS homologues. Nonetheless upon heterologous expression in an engineered Escherichia coli host, Tyt1 catalyzes robust Na+-dependent, highly selective l-tyrosine transport. Genetic engineering of Tyt1 variants devoid of cysteines or with individually retained endogenous cysteines at positions 18 or 238, at the cytoplasmic ends of TM1 and TM6, respectively, preserved normal transport activity. Whereas cysteine-less Tyt1 was resistant to the inhibitory effect of sulfhydryl-alkylating reagents, N-ethylmaleimide inhibited transport by Tyt1 variants containing either one or both of the endogenous cysteines, and this inhibition was altered by the substrates sodium and tyrosine, consistent with substrate-induced dynamics in the transport pathway. Our findings support a binding model of Tyt1 function in which an ordered sequence of substrate-induced structural changes reflects distinct conformational states of the transporter. This work identifies Tyt1 as the first functional bacterial NSS member putatively consisting of only 11 TMs and shows that Tyt1 is a suitable model for the study of NSS dynamics with relevance to structure/function relationships of human NSSs, including the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid transporters.",

Structural insights from these and other bacterial transporters will help to rationalize the mechanisms for the increasingly complex functions that have been described for mammalian transporters, in addition to their modes of regulation.

        "Abstract": "The functional characteristics of the forward and reverse transport modes of the human Na(+)/glucose transporter (hSGLT1) were investigated using plasma membrane vesicles of E. coli expressing the recombinant transporter. Correctly and inverse-oriented vesicles were employed to measure the initial rates of methyl-alpha-D-glucose uptake, under zero-trans conditions, as a function of Na(+), sugar, and phlorizin concentrations and membrane potential. This approach enabled the analysis of the two faces of hSGLT1 in parallel, revealing the reversibility of Na(+)/sugar cotransport. While the key characteristics of secondary active sugar transport were maintained in both modes, namely, Na(+) and voltage dependence, the kinetic properties of the two sides indicated a functional asymmetry of the transporter. That is, the apparent affinity for sugar and driver cation Na(+) exhibited a difference of more than 1 order of magnitude between the two modes. Furthermore, the selectivity pattern of ligands and the interaction of the transporter with the competitive inhibitor phlorizin were different. Whereas the high-affinity substrates, D-glucose and D-galactose, inhibited uptake of radioactive sugar tracer at their physiological concentrations (10 mM) in the forward reaction, they were poor inhibitors even at high concentrations in the reverse transport mode. Taken together, these results confirm the successful employment of E. coli to express and characterize a human membrane protein (hSGLT1), elucidating the functional asymmetry of this cotransporter.",

        "Abstract": "Large-scale purification of recombinant human membrane proteins represents a rate-limiting step toward the understanding of their role in health and disease. There are only four mammalian membrane proteins of known structure, and these were isolated from natural sources (see http://www.mpibp-frankfurt.mpg.de/michel/public/memprotstruct.html). In addition, genetic diseases of membrane proteins are frequently caused by trafficking defects, and it is enigmatic whether these mutants are functional. Here, we report the employment of Escherichia coli for the functional expression, purification, and reconstitution of a human membrane protein, the human Na+/glucose cotransporter (hSGLT1). The use of an E. coli mutant defective in the outer membrane protease OmpT, incubation temperatures below 20 degrees C, and transcriptional regulation from the lac promoter/operator are crucial to reduce proteolytic degradation. Purification of a recombinant hSGLT1 through affinity chromatography yields about 1 mg of purified recombinant hSGLT1 per 3 liters of cultured bacterial cells. Kinetic analysis of hSGLT1 in proteoliposomes reveals that a purified recombinant transporter, which is missorted in eukaryotic cells, retains full catalytic activity. These results indicate the power of bacteria to manufacture and isolate human membrane proteins implicated in genetic diseases.",

        "Title": "Sites important for Na+ and substrate binding in the Na+/proline transporter of Escherichia coli, a member of the Na+/solute symporter family.",
        "Abstract": "To elucidate the functional importance of transmembrane domain II in the Na(+)/proline transporter (PutP) of Escherichia coli we analyzed the effect of replacing Ser-54 through Gly-58. Substitution of Asp-55 or Met-56 dramatically reduces the apparent affinity for Na(+) and Li(+) in a cation-dependent manner. Conversely, Cys in place of Gly-58 significantly reduces only the apparent proline affinity while substitution of Ser-57 results in a dramatic reduction of the apparent proline and cation affinities. Interestingly, upon increasing the proline concentration the apparent Na(+) affinity of Ser-57 replacement mutants converges toward the wild-type value, indicating a close cooperativity between cation and substrate site(s). This notion is supported by the fact that Na(+)-stimulated site-specific fluorescence labeling of a single Cys at position 57 is completely reversed by the addition of proline. Similar results are obtained upon labeling of a Cys at position 54 or 58. Taken together, these results indicate that Asp-55 and Met-56 are located at or close to the ion-binding site while Ser-54, Ser-57, and Gly-58 may be close to the proline translocation pathway. In addition, the data prod at an involvement of the latter residues in ligand-induced conformational dynamics that are crucial for cation-coupled transport.",
