        "Abstract": "Autophagy is central to the benefits of longevity signaling programs and to hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) response to nutrient stress. With age, a subset of HSCs increases autophagy flux and preserves regenerative capacity, but the signals triggering autophagy and maintaining the functionality of autophagy-activated old HSCs (oHSCs) remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is an adaptive cytoprotective response to chronic inflammation in the aging murine bone marrow (BM) niche. We find that inflammation impairs glucose uptake and suppresses glycolysis in oHSCs through Socs3-mediated inhibition of AKT/FoxO-dependent signaling, with inflammation-mediated autophagy engagement preserving functional quiescence by enabling metabolic adaptation to glycolytic impairment. Moreover, we show that transient autophagy induction via a short-term fasting/refeeding paradigm normalizes glycolytic flux and significantly boosts oHSC regenerative potential. Our results identify inflammation-driven glucose hypometabolism as a key driver of HSC dysfunction with age and establish autophagy as a targetable node to reset oHSC regenerative capacity.",

        "Abstract": "Definitive haematopoiesis is the process by which haematopoietic stem cells, located in the bone marrow, generate all haematopoietic cell lineages in healthy adults. Although highly regulated to maintain a stable output of blood cells in health, the haematopoietic system is capable of extensive remodelling in response to external challenges, prioritizing the production of certain cell types at the expense of others. In this Review, we consider how acute insults, such as infections and cytotoxic drug-induced myeloablation, cause molecular, cellular and metabolic changes in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells at multiple levels of the haematopoietic hierarchy to drive accelerated production of the mature myeloid cells needed to resolve the initiating insult. Moreover, we discuss how dysregulation or subversion of these emergency myelopoiesis mechanisms contributes to the progression of chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Neonates are highly susceptible to inflammation and infection. Here, we investigate how late fetal liver (FL) mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) respond to inflammation, testing the hypothesis that deficits in the engagement of emergency myelopoiesis (EM) pathways limit neutrophil output and contribute to perinatal neutropenia. We show that fetal HSPCs have limited production of myeloid cells at steady state and fail to activate a classical adult-like EM transcriptional program. Moreover, we find that fetal HSPCs can respond to EM-inducing inflammatory stimuli in vitro but are restricted by maternal anti-inflammatory factors, primarily interleukin-10 (IL-10), from activating EM pathways in utero. Accordingly, we demonstrate that the loss of maternal IL-10 restores EM activation in fetal HSPCs but at the cost of fetal demise. These results reveal the evolutionary trade-off inherent in maternal anti-inflammatory responses that maintain pregnancy but render the fetus unresponsive to EM activation signals and susceptible to infection.",

We particularly focus on the role of cell cycle regulation, inflammatory response pathways, epigenetic changes, and metabolic regulation.

        "Abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and downstream lineage-biased multipotent progenitors (MPP) tailor blood production and control myelopoiesis on demand. Recent lineage tracing analyses revealed MPPs to be major functional contributors to steady-state hematopoiesis. However, we still lack a precise resolution of myeloid differentiation trajectories and cellular heterogeneity in the MPP compartment. Here, we found that myeloid-biased MPP3 are functionally and molecularly heterogeneous, with a distinct subset of myeloid-primed secretory cells with high endoplasmic reticulum (ER) volume and FcγR expression. We show that FcγR+/ERhigh MPP3 are a transitional population serving as a reservoir for rapid production of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP), which directly amplify myelopoiesis through inflammation-triggered secretion of cytokines in the local bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Our results identify a novel regulatory function for a secretory MPP3 subset that controls myeloid differentiation through lineage-priming and cytokine production and acts as a self-reinforcing amplification compartment in inflammatory stress and disease conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammation exerts multiple effects on the early hematopoietic compartment. Best studied is the role of proinflammatory cytokines in activating adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to dynamically replenish myeloid lineage cells in a process known as emergency myelopoiesis. However, it is increasingly appreciated that the same proinflammatory signaling pathways are used in diverse hematopoietic scenarios. This review focuses on inflammatory signaling in the emergence of the definitive hematopoietic compartment during embryonic life, and tonic inflammatory signals derived from commensal microbiota in shaping the adult hematopoietic compartment in the absence of pathogenic insults. Insights into the unique and shared aspects of inflammatory signaling that regulate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell function across the lifespan and health span of an individual will enable better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to hematopoietic dysregulation and malignancies.",

        "Abstract": "While young blood can restore many aged tissues, its effects on the aged blood system itself and old hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have not been determined. Here, we used transplantation, parabiosis, plasma transfer, exercise, calorie restriction, and aging mutant mice to understand the effects of age-regulated systemic factors on HSCs and their bone marrow (BM) niche. We found that neither exposure to young blood, nor long-term residence in young niches after parabiont separation, nor direct heterochronic transplantation had any observable rejuvenating effects on old HSCs. Likewise, exercise and calorie restriction did not improve old HSC function, nor old BM niches. Conversely, young HSCs were not affected by systemic pro-aging conditions, and HSC function was not impacted by mutations influencing organismal aging in established long-lived or progeroid genetic models. Therefore, the blood system that carries factors with either rejuvenating or pro-aging properties for many other tissues is itself refractory to those factors.",

        "Abstract": "Haematopoiesis is governed by haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that produce all lineages of blood and immune cells. The maintenance of blood homeostasis requires a dynamic response of HSCs to stress, and dysregulation of these adaptive-response mechanisms underlies the development of myeloid leukaemia. Leukaemogenesis often occurs in a stepwise manner, with genetic and epigenetic changes accumulating in pre-leukaemic HSCs prior to the emergence of leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) and the development of acute myeloid leukaemia. Clinical data have revealed the existence of age-related clonal haematopoiesis, or the asymptomatic clonal expansion of mutated blood cells in the elderly, and this phenomenon is connected to susceptibility to leukaemic transformation. Here we describe how selection for specific mutations that increase HSC competitive fitness, in conjunction with additional endogenous and environmental changes, drives leukaemic transformation. We review the ways in which LSCs take advantage of normal HSC properties to promote survival and expansion, thus underlying disease recurrence and resistance to conventional therapies, and we detail our current understanding of leukaemic 'stemness' regulation. Overall, we link the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating HSC behaviour with the functional dysregulation of these mechanisms in myeloid leukaemia and discuss opportunities for targeting LSC-specific mechanisms for the prevention or cure of malignant diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The hematopoietic system is highly organized to maintain its functional integrity and to meet lifelong organismal demands. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) must balance self-renewal with differentiation and the regeneration of the blood system. It is a complex balancing act between these competing HSC functions. Although highly quiescent at steady state, HSCs become activated in response to inflammatory cytokines and regenerative challenges. This activation phase leads to many intrinsic stresses such as replicative, metabolic, and oxidative stress, which can cause functional decline, impaired self-renewal, and exhaustion of HSCs. To cope with these insults, HSCs use both built-in and emergency-triggered stress-response mechanisms to maintain homeostasis and to defend against disease development. In this review, we discuss how the hematopoietic system operates in steady state and stress conditions, what strategies are used to maintain functional integrity, and how deregulation in the balance between self-renewal and regeneration can drive malignant transformation.",

Here, we show that an inducible pathway of myeloid regeneration involving the remodeling of the multipotent progenitor (MPP) compartment downstream of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is commonly hijacked in myeloid malignancies. We establish that differential regulation of Notch and Wnt signaling transiently triggers myeloid regeneration from HSCs in response to stress, and that constitutive low Notch and high Wnt activity in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) maintains this pathway activated in malignancies. We also identify compensatory crosstalk mechanisms between Notch and Wnt signaling that prevent damaging HSC function, MPP production, and blood output in conditions of high Notch and low Wnt activity. Finally, we demonstrate that restoring Notch and Wnt deregulated activity in LSCs attenuates disease progression. Our results uncover a mechanism that controls myeloid regeneration and early lineage decisions in HSCs and could be targeted in LSCs to normalize leukemic myeloid cell production.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammation coordinates tissue regeneration via damaged cell removal and stem cell activation. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) survive inflammatory stress that kills other blood cells, but the mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly understood. Here, we find that tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) acts differently on HSCs and progenitors, thus facilitating hematopoietic clearance and promoting regeneration. We show that while inducing myeloid progenitor apoptosis, TNF-α promotes HSC survival and myeloid differentiation by activating a strong and specific p65-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent gene program that primarily prevents necroptosis rather than apoptosis, induces immunomodulatory functions, and poises HSCs for myeloid cell production. These TNF-α-driven mechanisms are critical for HSC response to inflammatory stress but are also hijacked in aged and malignant HSCs. Our results reveal several TNF-α-mediated pro-survival mechanisms unique to HSCs, highlight an important role for necroptosis in HSC killing, and establish TNF-α as a major pro-survival and pro-regeneration factor for HSCs.",

We discuss how inflammatory and growth signals from the aged bone marrow (BM) microenvironment contribute to cell-intrinsic HSC aging phenotypes and favor leukemia development.

        "Abstract": "Although many aspects of blood production are well understood, the spatial organization of myeloid differentiation in the bone marrow remains unknown. Here we use imaging to track granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) behaviour in mice during emergency and leukaemic myelopoiesis. In the steady state, we find individual GMPs scattered throughout the bone marrow. During regeneration, we observe expanding GMP patches forming defined GMP clusters, which, in turn, locally differentiate into granulocytes. The timed release of important bone marrow niche signals (SCF, IL-1β, G-CSF, TGFβ and CXCL4) and activation of an inducible Irf8 and β-catenin progenitor self-renewal network control the transient formation of regenerating GMP clusters. In leukaemia, we show that GMP clusters are constantly produced owing to persistent activation of the self-renewal network and a lack of termination cytokines that normally restore haematopoietic stem-cell quiescence. Our results uncover a previously unrecognized dynamic behaviour of GMPs in situ, which tunes emergency myelopoiesis and is hijacked in leukaemia.",

        "Abstract": "With age, haematopoietic stem cells lose their ability to regenerate the blood system, and promote disease development. Autophagy is associated with health and longevity, and is critical for protecting haematopoietic stem cells from metabolic stress. Here we show that loss of autophagy in haematopoietic stem cells causes accumulation of mitochondria and an activated metabolic state, which drives accelerated myeloid differentiation mainly through epigenetic deregulations, and impairs haematopoietic stem-cell self-renewal activity and regenerative potential. Strikingly, most haematopoietic stem cells in aged mice share these altered metabolic and functional features. However, approximately one-third of aged haematopoietic stem cells exhibit high autophagy levels and maintain a low metabolic state with robust long-term regeneration potential similar to healthy young haematopoietic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that autophagy actively suppresses haematopoietic stem-cell metabolism by clearing active, healthy mitochondria to maintain quiescence and stemness, and becomes increasingly necessary with age to preserve the regenerative capacity of old haematopoietic stem cells.",

        "Abstract": "Many tissues and organ systems in metazoans have the intrinsic capacity to regenerate, which is driven and maintained largely by tissue-resident somatic stem cell populations. Ageing is accompanied by a deregulation of stem cell function and a decline in regenerative capacity, often resulting in degenerative diseases. The identification of strategies to maintain stem cell function and regulation is therefore a promising avenue to allay a wide range of age-related diseases. Studies in various organisms have revealed a central role for metabolic pathways in the regulation of stem cell function. Ageing is associated with extensive metabolic changes, and interventions that influence cellular metabolism have long been recognized as robust lifespan-extending measures. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the metabolic control of stem cell function, and how stem cell metabolism relates to homeostasis and ageing.",

        "Abstract": "Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain lifelong blood production and increase blood cell numbers in response to chronic and acute injury. However, the mechanism(s) by which inflammatory insults are communicated to HSCs and their consequences for HSC activity remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin-1 (IL-1), which functions as a key pro-inflammatory 'emergency' signal, directly accelerates cell division and myeloid differentiation of HSCs through precocious activation of a PU.1-dependent gene program. Although this effect is essential for rapid myeloid recovery following acute injury to the bone marrow, chronic IL-1 exposure restricts HSC lineage output, severely erodes HSC self-renewal capacity, and primes IL-1-exposed HSCs to fail massive replicative challenges such as transplantation. Importantly, these damaging effects are transient and fully reversible on IL-1 withdrawal. Our results identify a critical regulatory circuit that tailors HSC responses to acute needs, and is likely to underlie deregulated blood homeostasis in chronic inflammation conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Despite great advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying blood production, lineage specification at the level of multipotent progenitors (MPPs) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MPP2 and MPP3 are distinct myeloid-biased MPP subsets that work together with lymphoid-primed MPP4 cells to control blood production. We find that all MPPs are produced in parallel by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but with different kinetics and at variable levels depending on hematopoietic demands. We also show that the normally rare myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic system. This shift is accompanied by a reduction in self-renewal activity in regenerating HSCs and reprogramming of MPP4 fate toward the myeloid lineage. Our results support a dynamic model of blood development in which HSCs convey lineage specification through independent production of distinct lineage-biased MPP subsets that, in turn, support lineage expansion and differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) rely on instructive cues from the bone marrow (BM) niche to maintain their quiescence and adapt blood production to the organism's needs. Alterations in the BM niche are commonly observed in blood malignancies and directly contribute to the aberrant function of disease-initiating leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Here, we review recent insights into the cellular and molecular determinants of the normal HSC niche and describe how genetic changes in stromal cells and leukemia-induced BM niche remodeling contribute to blood malignancies. Moreover, we discuss how these findings can be applied to non-cell-autonomous therapies targeting the LSC niche.",

        "Abstract": "Hematopoiesis is the hierarchical process in which all lineages of blood cells are produced by self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM). While the regulatory factors that maintain proper HSC function and lineage output under normal conditions are well understood, significantly less is known about how HSC fate is regulated in response to inflammation or disease. As many blood disorders are associated with overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, significant interest has emerged in understanding the impact of these factors on HSC function. In this review we highlight key advances demonstrating the impact of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the biology of HSCs and the BM niche, and address ongoing questions regarding their role in normal and pathogenic hematopoiesis.",

        "Abstract": "Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew for life, thereby making them one of the few blood cells that truly age. Paradoxically, although HSCs numerically expand with age, their functional activity declines over time, resulting in degraded blood production and impaired engraftment following transplantation. While many drivers of HSC ageing have been proposed, the reason why HSC function degrades with age remains unknown. Here we show that cycling old HSCs in mice have heightened levels of replication stress associated with cell cycle defects and chromosome gaps or breaks, which are due to decreased expression of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase components and altered dynamics of DNA replication forks. Nonetheless, old HSCs survive replication unless confronted with a strong replication challenge, such as transplantation. Moreover, once old HSCs re-establish quiescence, residual replication stress on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes leads to the formation of nucleolar-associated γH2AX signals, which persist owing to ineffective H2AX dephosphorylation by mislocalized PP4c phosphatase rather than ongoing DNA damage. Persistent nucleolar γH2AX also acts as a histone modification marking the transcriptional silencing of rDNA genes and decreased ribosome biogenesis in quiescent old HSCs. Our results identify replication stress as a potent driver of functional decline in old HSCs, and highlight the MCM DNA helicase as a potential molecular target for rejuvenation therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Type I interferons (IFN-1s) are antiviral cytokines that suppress blood production while paradoxically inducing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation. Here, we clarify the relationship between the proliferative and suppressive effects of IFN-1s on HSC function during acute and chronic IFN-1 exposure. We show that IFN-1-driven HSC proliferation is a transient event resulting from a brief relaxation of quiescence-enforcing mechanisms in response to acute IFN-1 exposure, which occurs exclusively in vivo. We find that this proliferative burst fails to exhaust the HSC pool, which rapidly returns to quiescence in response to chronic IFN-1 exposure. Moreover, we demonstrate that IFN-1-exposed HSCs with reestablished quiescence are largely protected from the killing effects of IFNs unless forced back into the cell cycle due to culture, transplantation, or myeloablative treatment, at which point they activate a p53-dependent proapoptotic gene program. Collectively, our results demonstrate that quiescence acts as a safeguard mechanism to ensure survival of the HSC pool during chronic IFN-1 exposure. We show that IFN-1s can poise HSCs for apoptosis but induce direct cell killing only upon active proliferation, thereby establishing a mechanism for the suppressive effects of IFN-1s on HSC function.",

        "Abstract": "Blood homeostasis is maintained by a rare population of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that self-renew and differentiate to give rise to all lineages of mature blood cells. In contrast to most other blood cells, HSCs are preserved throughout life, and the maintenance of their genomic integrity is therefore paramount to ensure normal blood production and to prevent leukemic transformation. HSCs are also one of the few blood cells that truly age and exhibit severe functional decline in old organisms, resulting in impaired blood homeostasis and increased risk for hematologic malignancies. In this review, we present the strategies used by HSCs to cope with the many genotoxic insults that they commonly encounter. We briefly describe the DNA-damaging insults that can affect HSC function and the mechanisms that are used by HSCs to prevent, survive, and repair DNA lesions. We also discuss an apparent paradox in HSC biology, in which the genome maintenance strategies used by HSCs to protect their function in fact render them vulnerable to the acquisition of damaging genetic aberrations.",

        "Abstract": "Multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) and their osteoblastic lineage cell (OBC) derivatives are part of the bone marrow (BM) niche and contribute to hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. Here, we show that myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) progressively remodels the endosteal BM niche into a self-reinforcing leukemic niche that impairs normal hematopoiesis, favors leukemic stem cell (LSC) function, and contributes to BM fibrosis. We show that leukemic myeloid cells stimulate MSCs to overproduce functionally altered OBCs, which accumulate in the BM cavity as inflammatory myelofibrotic cells. We identify roles for thrombopoietin, CCL3, and direct cell-cell interactions in driving OBC expansion, and for changes in TGF-β, Notch, and inflammatory signaling in OBC remodeling. MPN-expanded OBCs, in turn, exhibit decreased expression of many HSC retention factors and severely compromised ability to maintain normal HSCs, but effectively support LSCs. Targeting this pathological interplay could represent a novel avenue for treatment of MPN-affected patients and prevention of myelofibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Blood production is ensured by rare, self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). How HSCs accommodate the diverse cellular stresses associated with their life-long activity remains elusive. Here we identify autophagy as an essential mechanism protecting HSCs from metabolic stress. We show that mouse HSCs, in contrast to their short-lived myeloid progeny, robustly induce autophagy after ex vivo cytokine withdrawal and in vivo calorie restriction. We demonstrate that FOXO3A is critical to maintain a gene expression program that poises HSCs for rapid induction of autophagy upon starvation. Notably, we find that old HSCs retain an intact FOXO3A-driven pro-autophagy gene program, and that ongoing autophagy is needed to mitigate an energy crisis and allow their survival. Our results demonstrate that autophagy is essential for the life-long maintenance of the HSC compartment and for supporting an old, failing blood system.",

        "Abstract": "Adult hematopoiesis occurs primarily in the BM space where hematopoietic cells interact with stromal niche cells. Despite this close association, little is known about the specific roles of osteoblastic lineage cells (OBCs) in maintaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and how conditions affecting bone formation influence HSC function. Here we use a transgenic mouse model with the ColI(2.3) promoter driving a ligand-independent, constitutively active 5HT4 serotonin receptor (Rs1) to address how the massive increase in trabecular bone formation resulting from increased G(s) signaling in OBCs impacts HSC function and blood production. Rs1 mice display fibrous dysplasia, BM aplasia, progressive loss of HSC numbers, and impaired megakaryocyte/erythrocyte development with defective recovery after hematopoietic injury. These hematopoietic defects develop without compensatory extramedullary hematopoiesis, and the loss of HSCs occurs despite a paradoxical expansion of stromal niche cells with putative HSC-supportive activity (ie, endothelial, mesenchymal, and osteoblastic cells). However, Rs1-expressing OBCs show decreased expression of key HSC-supportive factors and impaired ability to maintain HSCs. Our findings indicate that long-term activation of G(s) signaling in OBCs leads to contextual changes in the BM niche that adversely affect HSC maintenance and blood homeostasis.",

Because HSCs must persist for a lifetime, the balance between their proliferation and quiescence is carefully regulated to ensure blood homeostasis while limiting cellular damage. Cell cycle regulation therefore plays a critical role in controlling HSC function during both fetal life and in the adult. The cell cycle activity of HSCs is carefully modulated by a complex interplay between cell-intrinsic mechanisms and cell-extrinsic factors produced by the microenvironment. This fine-tuned regulatory network may become altered with age, leading to aberrant HSC cell cycle regulation, degraded HSC function, and hematological malignancy.",

We refine the characterization of CML leukemic stem cells (LSCs) to the most immature long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and identify some important molecular deregulations underlying their aberrant behavior. We find that CML multipotent progenitors (MPPs) exhibit an aberrant B-lymphoid potential but are redirected toward the myeloid lineage by the action of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. We show that BCR/ABL activity controls Il-6 expression thereby establishing a paracrine feedback loop that sustains CML development. These results describe how proinflammatory tumor environment affects leukemic progenitor cell fate and contributes to CML pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Hematopoiesis, the process by which all mature blood cells are generated from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), is a finely tuned balancing act in which HSCs must constantly decide between different cell fates: to proliferate, to self-renew or differentiate, to stay quiescent in the bone marrow niche or migrate to the periphery, to live or die. These fates are regulated by a complex interplay between cell-extrinsic cues and cell-intrinsic regulatory pathways whose function is to maintain a homeostatic balance between HSC self-renewal and life-long replenishment of lost blood cells. Improper regulation of these competing cellular programs can transform HSCs and progenitor cells into disease-initiating leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Strikingly, many of the mechanisms required for maintenance of normal HSC fate decisions are equally critical for the aberrant functions of LSCs. Because of the inherent complexities of these molecular mechanisms, a systematic approach to understanding the regulatory networks underlying HSC self-renewal is critical for uncovering the similarities and differences between HSCs and LSCs. In this review, we focus on recent developments in elucidating the regulatory networks governing normal HSC self-renewal programs and their implications for leukemic transformation. We describe the current technical and methodological limitations in isolating and characterizing HSCs and LSCs, and the emerging approaches that may afford a better understanding of the regulation of normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. Finally, we discuss how such basic mechanistic information may be of use for the design of novel therapies that will selectively reprogram and/or eliminate LSCs.",

        "Abstract": "Most adult stem cells, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), are maintained in a quiescent or resting state in vivo. Quiescence is widely considered to be an essential protective mechanism for stem cells that minimizes endogenous stress caused by cellular respiration and DNA replication. We demonstrate that HSC quiescence can also have detrimental effects. We found that HSCs have unique cell-intrinsic mechanisms ensuring their survival in response to ionizing irradiation (IR), which include enhanced prosurvival gene expression and strong activation of p53-mediated DNA damage response. We show that quiescent and proliferating HSCs are equally radioprotected but use different types of DNA repair mechanisms. We describe how nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated DNA repair in quiescent HSCs is associated with acquisition of genomic rearrangements, which can persist in vivo and contribute to hematopoietic abnormalities. Our results demonstrate that quiescence is a double-edged sword that renders HSCs intrinsically vulnerable to mutagenesis following DNA damage.",

        "Abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are rare, multipotent cells capable of generating all specialized cells of the blood system. Appropriate regulation of HSC quiescence is thought to be crucial to maintain their lifelong function; however, the molecular pathways controlling stem cell quiescence remain poorly characterized. Likewise, the molecular events driving leukemogenesis remain elusive. In this study, we compare the gene expression profiles of steady-state bone marrow HSC to non-self-renewing multipotent progenitors; to HSC treated with mobilizing drugs that expand the HSC pool and induce egress from the marrow; and to leukemic HSC in a mouse model of chronic myelogenous leukemia. By intersecting the resulting lists of differentially regulated genes we identify a subset of molecules that are downregulated in all three circumstances, and thus may be particularly important for the maintenance and function of normal, quiescent HSC. These results identify potential key regulators of HSC and give insights into the clinically important processes of HSC mobilization for transplantation and leukemic development from cancer stem cells.",

Here, we show that junB inactivation deregulates the cell-cycle machinery and increases the proliferation of long-term repopulating HSCs (LT-HSCs) without impairing their self-renewal or regenerative potential in vivo. We found that JunB loss destabilizes a complex network of genes and pathways that normally limit myeloid differentiation, leading to impaired responsiveness to both Notch and TGF-beta signaling due in part to transcriptional deregulation of the Hes1 gene. These results demonstrate that LT-HSC proliferation and differentiation are uncoupled from self-renewal and establish some of the mechanisms by which JunB normally limits the production of myeloid progenitors, hence preventing initiation of myeloid malignancies.",

        "Abstract": "This report presents highlights of discussions that focused on the biology of cancer stem cells as conducted at the fifth Annual Meeting of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, held in Cairns, Australia, June 17-20, 2007. The function of adult stem cells is believed to depend on their niches, that is, the microenvironment in which these stem cells reside. A similar concept applies to understanding the development of cancer, as it is becoming increasingly clear that only a small subset of cancer cell populations is capable of initiating/sustaining tumor formation. These tumorigenic cells, commonly referred to as cancer stem cells, also appear to reside in particular niches, and they bear the known, albeit dysfunctional, stem cell characteristics of self-renewal and differentiation. Dysregulation of stem cell niches is thought to contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting the complex network of signaling interactions that occur between stem cells and their neighboring cells, thus imbalancing the physiological controls on self-renewal and differentiation processes. This hypothesis was widely explored at the conference to shed new light on the mechanisms of tumor origin and progression and to unveil novel antitumor therapeutic approaches.",

        "Title": "Evidence that the Pim1 kinase gene is a direct target of HOXA9.",
        "Abstract": "The HOXA9 homeoprotein exerts dramatic effects in hematopoiesis. Enforced expression of HOXA9 enhances proliferation of primitive blood cells, expands hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and leads to myeloid leukemia. Conversely, loss of HOXA9 inhibits proliferation and impairs HSC function. The pathways by which HOXA9 acts are largely unknown, and although HOXA9 is a transcription factor, few direct target genes have been identified. Our previous study suggested that HOXA9 positively regulates Pim1, an oncogenic kinase. The hematologic phenotypes of Hoxa9- and Pim1-deficient animals are strikingly similar. Here we show that HOXA9 protein binds to the Pim1 promoter and induces Pim1 mRNA and protein in hematopoietic cells. Pim1 protein is diminished in Hoxa9(-/-) cells, and Hoxa9 and Pim1 mRNA levels track together in early hematopoietic compartments. Induction of Pim1 protein by HOXA9 increases the phosphorylation and inactivation of the proapoptotic BAD protein, a target of Pim1. Hoxa9(-/-) cells show increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, defects that are ameliorated by reintroduction of Pim1. Thus Pim1 appears to be a direct transcriptional target of HOXA9 and a mediator of its antiapoptotic and proproliferative effects in early cells. Since HOXA9 is frequently up-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia, Pim1 may be a therapeutic target in human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Leukemias can now be viewed as aberrant hematopoietic processes initiated by rare cancer stem cells, or leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that have maintained or reacquired the capacity for indefinite proliferation through accumulated mutations and/or epigenetic changes. Yet, despite their critical importance, much remains to be learned about the developmental origin of LSCs and the mechanisms responsible for their emergence in the course of the disease. Mouse models of human leukemias have provided a unique system to study the mechanisms influencing LSC generation and function, and were recently used to demonstrate that LSCs can arise from both self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and committed progenitor populations. This striking finding indicates that LSC identity is largely dictated by the nature of the oncogenic events and by how these events perturb essential processes such as self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Such approaches in the mouse are essential for the basic understanding of leukemogenesis and for the conceptual design of novel therapeutic strategies that could lead to improved treatments for human leukemias.",

Here, we used sensitive in vivo approaches to quantitatively and kinetically assess the MegE potential of hematopoietic stem cells and various Flk2(+) early progenitors and compared it with the MegE potential of downstream committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors and with their ability to give rise to mature myelomonocytic and lymphoid cells. We demonstrate that Flk2(+) early progenitors retain MegE potential in vivo both at the population and clonal levels. These results indicate that Flk2 expression by early progenitors is not at the expense of full multipotency and support the current model of hematopoietic development with segregation of myeloid and lymphoid lineages from multipotent progenitors.",

By taking a forward genetic approach, we have identified a locus encoded near the FuHC, called fester, which is polymorphic, polygenic, and inherited in distinct haplotypes. Somatic diversification occurs through extensive alternative splicing, with each individual expressing a unique repertoire of splice forms, both membrane bound and potentially secreted, all expressed in tissues intimately associated with histocompatibility. Functional studies, via both siRNA-mediated knockdown and direct blocking by monoclonal antibodies raised against fester, were able to disrupt predicted histocompatibility outcomes. The genetic and somatic diversity, coupled to the expression and functional data, suggests that fester is a receptor involved in histocompatibility.",

Using highly purified stem and progenitor cell populations, we define the proliferation index and status of the cell cycle machinery at discrete stages of hematopoietic differentiation and during cytokine-mediated HSC mobilization. We identify distinct sets of cell cycle proteins that specifically associate with differentiation, self-renewal, and maintenance of quiescence in HSC and progenitor cells. Moreover, we describe a striking inequality of function among in vivo cycling and quiescent HSC by demonstrating that their long-term engraftment potential resides predominantly in the G(0) fraction. These data provide a direct link between HSC proliferation and function and identify discrete molecular targets in regulating HSC cell fate decisions that could have implications for both the therapeutic use of HSC and the understanding of leukemic transformation.",

        "Abstract": "Blood-related cancers, or leukemias, have been shown to arise from a rare subset of cells that escape normal regulation and drive the formation and growth of the tumor. The finding that these so-called cancer stem cells, or leukemic stem cells (LSC), can be purified away from the other cells in the tumor allows their precise analysis to identify candidate molecules and regulatory pathways that play a role in progression, maintenance, and spreading of leukemias. The analyses of the other, numerically dominant, cells in the tumor, while also interesting, do not directly interrogate these key properties of malignancies. Mouse models of human myeloproliferative disorder and acute myelogenous leukemia have highlighted the remarkable conservation of disease mechanisms between both species. They can now be used to identify the LSC for each type of human leukemia and understand how they escape normal regulation and become malignant. Given the clinical importance of LSC identification, the insights gained through these approaches will quickly translate into clinical applications and lead to improved treatments for human leukemias.",

In this issue of Cancer Cell, Huntly and colleagues report a striking difference in the ability of two leukemia-associated fusion proteins, MOZ-TIF2 and BCR-ABL, to transform myeloid progenitor populations. This rigorous study supports the idea of a hierarchy among leukemia-associated protooncogenes for their ability to endow committed myeloid progenitors with the self-renewal capacity driving leukemic stem cell propagation, and sheds new light on the pathogenesis of chronic and acute myelogenous leukemias.",

        "Abstract": "The AP-1 transcription factor JunB is a transcriptional regulator of myelopoiesis. Inactivation of JunB in postnatal mice results in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) resembling early human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Here, we show that JunB regulates the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). JunB overexpression decreases the frequency of long-term HSC (LT-HSC), while JunB inactivation specifically expands the numbers of LT-HSC and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) resulting in chronic MPD. Further, we demonstrate that junB inactivation must take place in LT-HSC, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce MPD and that only junB-deficient LT-HSC are capable of transplanting the MPD to recipient mice. These results demonstrate a stem cell-specific role for JunB in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis and provide experimental evidence that leukemic stem cells (LSC) can reside at the LT-HSC stage of development in a mouse model of MPD.",

        "Abstract": "We have used the hematopoietic system as a model to investigate whether acute myeloid leukemia arises exclusively from self-renewing stem cells or also from short-lived myeloid progenitors. When transduced with a leukemogenic MLL fusion gene, prospectively isolated stem cells and myeloid progenitor populations with granulocyte/macrophage differentiation potential are efficiently immortalized in vitro and result in the rapid onset of acute myeloid leukemia with similar latencies following transplantation in vivo. Regardless of initiating cell, leukemias displayed immunophenotypes and gene expression profiles characteristic of maturation arrest at an identical late stage of myelomonocytic differentiation, putatively a monopotent monocytic progenitor stage. Our findings unequivocally establish the ability of transient repopulating progenitors to initiate myeloid leukemias in response to an MLL oncogene, and support the existence of cancer stem cells that do not necessarily overlap with multipotent stem cells of the tissue of origin.",

        "Abstract": "Leukemia can be viewed as a newly formed, abnormal hematopoietic tissue initiated by a few leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that undergo an aberrant and poorly regulated process of organogenesis analogous to that of normal hematopoietic stem cells. A hallmark of all cancers is the capacity for unlimited self-renewal, which is also a defining characteristic of normal stem cells. Given this shared attribute, it has been proposed that leukemias may be initiated by transforming events that take place in hematopoietic stem cells. Alternatively, leukemias may also arise from more committed progenitors caused by mutations and/or selective expression of genes that enhance their otherwise limited self-renewal capabilities. Identifying the LSCs for each type of leukemia is a current challenge and a critical step in understanding their respective biologies and may provide key insights into more effective treatments. Moreover, LSC identification and purification will provide a powerful diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tool in the clinic.",

We demonstrate here that a representative MLL fusion protein, MLL-GAS7, impairs the differentiation and enhances the in vitro growth of murine hematopoietic cells with multipotent features. The multilineage differentiation potential of these cells was suggested by their immuno-phenotypes and transcriptional programs and confirmed by their ability to induce three pathologically distinct leukemias in mice, including an acute biphenotypic leukemia (ABL) that recapitulates the distinctive hallmark features of many MLL-associated leukemias in humans. This experimental modeling of ABL in mice highlights its origin from multipotential progenitors that arrest at a bipotential stage specifically targeted or induced by MLL oncogenes.",

Here we show, by a knock-in strategy and a transgenic complementation approach, that Junb can substitute for absence of Jun during mouse development. Junb can rescue both liver and cardiac defects in Jun-null mice in a manner dependent on gene dosage. JunB restores the expression of genes regulated by Jun/Fos, but not those regulated by Jun/ATF, thereby rescuing Jun-dependent defects in vivo as well as in primary fibroblasts and fetal hepatoblasts in vitro. Thus, the transcriptionally less active JunB has the potential to substitute for Jun, indicating that the spatial and temporal regulation of expression of the transcription factor AP-1 may be more important than the coding sequence of its components.",
