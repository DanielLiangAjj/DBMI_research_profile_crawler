        "Abstract": "Genome organization is thought to underlie cell type specific gene expression, yet how it is regulated in progenitors to produce cellular diversity is unknown. In Drosophila, a developmentally-timed genome reorganization in neural progenitors terminates competence to produce early-born neurons. These events require downregulation of Distal antenna (Dan), part of the conserved pipsqueak DNA-binding superfamily. Here we find that Dan forms liquid-like condensates with high protein mobility, and whose size and subnuclear distribution are balanced with its DNA-binding. Further, we identify a LARKS domain, a structural motif associated with condensate-forming proteins. Deleting just 13 amino acids from LARKS abrogates Dan's ability to retain the early-born neural fate gene, hunchback, in the neuroblast nuclear interior and maintain competence in vivo. Conversely, domain-swapping with LARKS from known phase-separating proteins rescues Dan's effects on competence. Together, we provide in vivo evidence for condensate formation and the regulation of progenitor nuclear architecture underlying neuronal diversification.",

        "Abstract": "Neural progenitors produce diverse cells in a stereotyped birth order, but can specify each cell type for only a limited duration. In the Drosophila embryo, neuroblasts (neural progenitors) specify multiple, distinct neurons by sequentially expressing a series of temporal identity transcription factors with each division. Hunchback (Hb), the first of the series, specifies early-born neuronal identity. Neuroblast competence to generate early-born neurons is terminated when the hb gene relocates to the neuroblast nuclear lamina, rendering it refractory to activation in descendent neurons. Mechanisms and trans-acting factors underlying this process are poorly understood. Here we identify Corto, an enhancer of Trithorax/Polycomb (ETP) protein, as a new regulator of neuroblast competence.",

        "Abstract": "The nuclear lamina is typically associated with transcriptional silencing, and peripheral relocation of genes highly correlates with repression. However, the DNA sequences and proteins regulating gene-lamina interactions are largely unknown. Exploiting the developmentally timed hunchback gene movement to the lamina in Drosophila neuroblasts, we identified a 250 bp intronic element (IE) both necessary and sufficient for relocation. The IE can target a reporter transgene to the lamina and silence it. Endogenously, however, hunchback is already repressed prior to relocation. Instead, IE-mediated relocation confers a heritably silenced gene state refractory to activation in descendent neurons, which terminates neuroblast competence to specify early-born identity. Surprisingly, we found that the Polycomb group chromatin factors bind the IE and are required for lamina relocation, revealing a nuclear architectural role distinct from their well-known function in transcriptional repression. Together, our results uncover in vivo mechanisms underlying neuroblast competence and lamina association in heritable gene silencing.",

        "Abstract": "One of the hallmarks of the metazoan genome is that genes are non-randomly positioned within the cell nucleus; in fact, the entire genome is packaged in a highly organized manner to orchestrate proper gene expression for each cell type. This is an especially daunting task for the development of the brain, which consists of an incredibly diverse population of neural cells. How genome architecture is established, maintained, and regulated to promote diverse cell fates and functions are fascinating questions with important implications in development and disease. The explosion in various biochemical and imaging techniques to analyze chromatin is now making it possible to interrogate the genome at an unprecedented resolution. Here we will focus on current advances in understanding genome architecture and gene regulation in the context of neural development.",

        "Abstract": "The vast diversity of neurons and glia of the CNS is generated from a small, heterogeneous population of progenitors that undergo transcriptional changes during development to sequentially specify distinct cell fates. Guided by cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic cues, invertebrate and mammalian neural progenitors carefully regulate when and how many of each cell type is produced, enabling the formation of functional neural circuits. Emerging evidence indicates that neural progenitors also undergo changes in global chromatin architecture, thereby restricting when a particular cell type can be generated. Studies of temporal-identity specification and progenitor competence can provide insight into how we could use neural progenitors to more effectively generate specific cell types for brain repair.",

In Drosophila, the Hunchback transcription factor acts in neural progenitors (neuroblasts) to specify early-born neurons, in part by indirectly inducing the neuronal transcription of its target genes, including the hunchback gene. We used in vivo immuno-DNA FISH and found that the hunchback gene moves to the neuroblast nuclear periphery, a repressive subnuclear compartment, precisely when competence to specify early-born fate is lost and several hours and cell divisions after termination of its transcription. hunchback movement to the lamina correlated with downregulation of the neuroblast nuclear protein, Distal antenna (Dan). Either prolonging Dan expression or disrupting lamina interfered with hunchback repositioning and extended neuroblast competence. We propose that neuroblasts undergo a developmentally regulated subnuclear genome reorganization to permanently silence Hunchback target genes that results in loss of progenitor competence.",

        "Abstract": "A fundamental question in brain development is how precursor cells generate a diverse group of neural progeny in an ordered manner. Drosophila neuroblasts sequentially express the transcription factors Hunchback (Hb), Krüppel (Kr), Pdm1/Pdm2 (Pdm) and Castor (Cas). Hb is necessary and sufficient to specify early-born temporal identity and, thus, Hb downregulation is essential for specification of later-born progeny. Here, we show that distal antenna (dan) and distal antenna-related (danr), encoding pipsqueak motif DNA-binding domain protein family members, are detected in all neuroblasts during the Hb-to-Cas expression window. Dan and Danr are required for timely downregulation of Hb in neuroblasts and for limiting the number of early-born neurons. Dan and Danr function independently of Seven-up (Svp), an orphan nuclear receptor known to repress Hb expression in neuroblasts, because Dan, Danr and Svp do not regulate each other and dan danr svp triple mutants have increased early-born neurons compared with either dan danr or svp mutants. Interestingly, misexpression of Hb can induce Dan and Svp expression in neuroblasts, suggesting that Hb might activate a negative feedback loop to limit its own expression. We conclude that Dan/Danr and Svp act in parallel pathways to limit Hb expression and allow neuroblasts to transition from making early-born neurons to late-born neurons at the proper time.",

        "Abstract": "The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the postnatal brain continuously generates olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons. We show that calretinin+, calbindin+, and dopaminergic (TH+) periglomerular OB interneurons correspond to distinct subtypes of GABAergic cells; all were produced in the postnatal mouse brain, but they matured and were eliminated at different rates. The embryonic lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) is thought to be the site of origin of postnatal SVZ neural progenitors. Consistently, grafts of the embryonic LGE into the adult brain SVZ generated many OB interneurons, including TH+ and calbindin+ periglomerular interneurons. However, calretinin+ cells were not produced from these LGE grafts. Surprisingly, pallial and septal embryonic progenitors transplanted into the adult brain SVZ also resulted in the generation of OB interneurons, including calretinin+ cells. A subset of Dlx2+ OB interneurons was derived from cells expressing Emx1, a transcription factor largely restricted to the pallium during development. Emx1 lineage-derived cells contributed a substantial portion of GABAergic cells in the OB, including calretinin+ interneurons. This is in contrast to cortex, in which Emx1 lineage-derived cells do not differentiate into GABAergic neurons. Our results suggest that some OB interneurons are derived from progenitors outside the LGE and that precursors expressing what has classically been considered a pallial transcription factor generate GABAergic interneurons.",

        "Abstract": "The subventricular zone (SVZ) produces different subclasses of olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons throughout life. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling the production of different types of interneurons. Here we show that most proliferating adult SVZ progenitors express the transcription factor Pax6, but only a small subpopulation of migrating neuroblasts and new OB interneurons derived from these progenitors retains Pax6 expression. To elucidate the cell-autonomous role of Pax6 in OB neurogenesis, we transplanted green fluorescent protein-expressing embryonic forebrain progenitors of the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence from Pax6 mutant Small Eye (Pax6(Sey/Sey)) mice into the SVZ of adult wild-type mice. Pax6(Sey/Sey) progenitors produce neuroblasts capable of migrating into the OB but fail to generate dopaminergic periglomerular and superficial granule cells. Interestingly, superficial granule neurons also express mRNA for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. Our data show that SVZ neuroblasts are heterogeneous and that Pax6 is required in a cell-autonomous manner for the production of cells in the dopaminergic lineage.",

        "Abstract": "We used deletion mutants to study beta-catenin function in axon arborization of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in live Xenopus laevis tadpoles. A deletion mutant betacatDeltaARM consists of the N- and C-terminal domains of wild-type beta-catenin that contain, respectively, alpha-catenin and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95)/discs large (Dlg)/zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) (PDZ) binding sites but lacks the central armadillo repeat region that binds cadherins and other proteins. Expression of DeltaARM in RGCs of live tadpoles perturbed axon arborization in two distinct ways: some RGC axons did not form arbors, whereas the remaining RGC axons formed arbors with abnormally long and tangled branches. Expression of the N- and C-terminal domains of beta-catenin separately in RGCs resulted in segregation of these two phenotypes. The axons of RGCs overexpressing the N-terminal domain of beta-catenin developed no or very few branches, whereas axons of RGCs overexpressing the C-terminal domain of beta-catenin formed arbors with long, tangled branches. Additional analysis revealed that the axons of RGCs that did not form arbors after overexpression of DeltaARM or the N-terminal domain of beta-catenin were frequently mistargeted within the tectum. These results suggest that interactions of the N-terminal domain of beta-catenin with alpha-catenin and of the C-terminal domain with PDZ domain-containing proteins are required, respectively, to initiate and shape axon arbors of RGCs in vivo.",
