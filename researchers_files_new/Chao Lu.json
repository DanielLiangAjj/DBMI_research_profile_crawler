        "Abstract": "During tumor development, promoter CpG islands that are normally silenced by Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) become DNA-hypermethylated. The molecular mechanism by which de novo DNA methyltransferase(s) [DNMT(s)] catalyze CpG methylation at PRC-regulated regions remains unclear. Here, we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the DNMT3A long isoform (DNMT3A1) amino-terminal region in complex with a nucleosome carrying PRC1-mediated histone H2A lysine-119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119Ub). We identify regions within the DNMT3A1 amino terminus that bind H2AK119Ub and the nucleosome acidic patch. This bidentate interaction is required for effective DNMT3A1 engagement with H2AK119Ub-modified chromatin in cells. Further, aberrant redistribution of DNMT3A1 to Polycomb target genes recapitulates the cancer-associated DNA hypermethylation signature and inhibits their transcriptional activation during cell differentiation. This effect is rescued by disruption of the DNMT3A1-acidic patch interaction. Together, our analyses reveal a binding interface critical for mediating promoter CpG island DNA hypermethylation, a major molecular hallmark of cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents is paramount for swiftly eradicating pathogenic bacteria, mitigating the onset of drug resistance, and preserving the homeostasis of bacterial microbiota in tissues. Owing to the limited affinity between the hydrophobic lipid bilayer interior of bacterial cells and most hydrophilic, polar peptides, the construction of a distinctive class of four-armed host-defense peptides/peptidomimetics (HDPs) is proposed with enhanced specificity and membrane perturbation capability against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by incorporating imidazole groups. These groups demonstrate substantial affinity for unsaturated phospholipids, which are predominantly expressed in the cell membrane of P. aeruginosa, thereby enabling HDPs to exhibit narrow-spectrum activity against this bacterium. Computational simulations and experimental investigations have corroborated that the imidazole-rich, four-armed peptidomimetics exhibit notable selectivity toward bacteria over mammalian cells. Among them, 4H10, characterized by its abundant and densely distributed imidazole groups, exhibits impressive activity against various clinically isolated P. aeruginosa strains. Moreover, 4H10 has demonstrated potential as an antibiotic adjuvant, enhancing doxycycline accumulation and exerting effects on intracellular targets by efficiently disrupting bacterial cell membranes. Consequently, the hydrogel composed of 4H10 and doxycycline emerged as a promising topical agent, significantly diminishing the skin P. aeruginosa burden by 97.1% within 2 days while inducing minimal local and systemic toxicity.",

We identify a PIM2-USP27X regulator of MYC signaling axis whose activity is an important contributor to the tumor biology of breast cancer. PIM2 phosphorylates USP27X, and promotes its deubiquitylation activity for MYC, which promotes its protein stability and leads to increase HK2-mediated aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer. Moreover, the PIM2-USP27X-MYC axis is also validated in PIM2-knockout mice. Taken together, these findings show a PIM2-USP27X-MYC signaling axis as a new potential target for breast cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component in the tumor microenvironment and have been shown to exhibitÂ protumorigenic effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to delve into the mechanisms underlying the tumor-promoting effects of CAFs in HCC. Small RNA sequencing was conducted to screen differential expressed microRNAs in exosomes derived from CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs). The miR-92a-3p expression was then measured using reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR in CAFs, NFs, CAFs-derived exosomes (CAFs-Exo), and NF-derived exosomes (NFs-Exo). Compared to NFs or NF-Exo, CAFs and CAFs-Exo significantly promoted HCC cell proliferation, migration, and stemness. Additionally, compared to NFs or NF-Exo, miR-92a-3p level was notably higher in CAFs and CAFs-Exo, respectively. Exosomal miR-92a-3p was found to enhance HCC cell proliferation, migration, and stemness. Meanwhile, AXIN1 was targeted by miR-92a-3p. Exosomal miR-92a-3p could activate Î²-catenin/CD44 signaling in HCC cells by inhibiting AXIN1 messenger RNA. Furthermore, in vivo studies verified that exosomal miR-92a-3p notably promoted tumor growth and stemness through targeting AXIN1/Î²-catenin axis. Collectively, CAFs secreted exosomal miR-92a-3p was capable of promoting growth and stemness in HCC through activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway by suppressing AXIN1. Therefore, targeting CAFs-derived miR-92a-3p may be a potential strategy for treating HCC.",

        "Abstract": "In this Letter, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a highly sensitive distributed dynamic pressure sensor based on a dual-linear frequency modulated optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) and a coating thickness-enhanced single-mode fiber (SMF). A dual-sideband linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal is used to interrogate the sensing fiber, which allows us to obtain a dual-sideband Rayleigh backscattering signal. Due to the opposite slopes of the two LFM sidebands, the Rayleigh backscattering spectra of the two sidebands drift in opposite directions when the fiber is disturbed. By subtracting the frequency shifts of the two spectra, we can double the system's sensitivity. We further enhance the sensitivity by using an SMF with a coating thickness of 200âÎ¼m. This results in a pressure sensitivity of 3979âMHz/MPa, a measurement accuracy of 0.76âkPa, and a spatial resolution of 35âcm over a 500âm optical fiber. Our system successfully detected a dynamic pressure change at a sampling rate of 1.25âkHz, demonstrating the sensor's excellent dynamic measuring capabilities.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel ultrasonic longitudinal wave resonance method for measuring the thickness of metal walls using a laser-electromagnetic acoustic transducer (Laser-EMAT). The method is based on the surface constraint mechanism (SCM) of the material and is expected to be capable of accurately detecting local thinning of metal walls in a non-contact manner and at high temperatures. Based on finite element analysis of laser-EMAT ultrasonic resonance measurement of aluminum alloy thickness, we investigated the effects of such key factors as SCM, irradiation parameters of laser source, and the size of EMAT receiving coil on the accuracy of thickness measurement (resonance frequency position) and on the amplitude of the resonance wave. Both numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the measurement accuracy of the proposed method is not affected by SCM, irradiation laser source parameters, and EMAT receiving coil size, and that accurate detection of stepped aluminum plates with thickness thinning from 3.0Â mm to 0.5Â mm is achieved. Furthermore, we were able to perform rapid detection of aluminum thin plate thickness at 500Â Â°C temperature with an EMAT lift-off of 5.0Â mm and achieved a relative experimental error as small as 3.40Â %. The results obtained in this study showed that the proposed method performed well in non-contact measurement of metal thinning in harsh environment of high temperature.",

        "Abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a sand fly-borne infection of significant public health concern in Pakistan (endemic for CL). This study aimed to scrutinize the environmental and socio-economic risk factors for CL in district Khyber (located on Pak-Afghan border), Pakistan. Clinically confirmed 2881 CL case records for (January-December) 2017 and 2020 were obtained from district hospital. In addition, a questionnaire for CL risk factors assessment was administered to 525 households (175 in 2017 and 350 in 2020) in 40 villages throughout the district in a household survey. Higher number of CL cases were recorded in 2020 (NÂ =Â 1824 belonging to 90 villages) compared to 2017 (NÂ =Â 1057 from 42 villages). Highest number of CL patient cases were recorded in tehsil Jamrud (NÂ =Â 2248, 39.01Â %), followed by Landi Kotal (NÂ =Â 398, 6.91Â %) and Bara (NÂ =Â 235, 4.08Â %). Records showed higher number of CL cases in males (NÂ =Â 1,659, 57.58Â %) compared to females (NÂ =Â 1,222, 42.41Â %). In 2017 and 2020 the disease burden peaked in January. GIS-based spatial analyses of hospital records revealed that CL cases were abundant at 294-1,916Â m elevation, in agriculture and range lands. Univariate logistic regression model analysis of risk factors suggested that higher education, family size >15, knowledge of CL, having family member/s that suffered from CL in the past, knowledge about biting time of sand flies, use of mosquito spray, presence of Afghan refugees in the village/s and living in mud-made houses increased the risk of acquiring CL. The multivariable logistic regression model showed none of the risk factors to be statistically significant. Findings of the study are crucial towards effective and targeted control of CL in district Khyber.",

Nanozymes offer a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of skin wounds, owing to their advantages in regulating redox homeostasis to reduce oxidative damage and kill bacteria.

        "Abstract": "The development of antibiotic-loaded microneedles has been hindered for years by limited excipient options, restricted drug-loading space, poor microneedle formability, and short-term drug retention. Therefore, this study proposes a dissolving microneedle fabricated from the host-defense peptide Îµ-poly-l-lysine (EPL) as an antibacterial adjuvant system for delivering antibiotics. EPL serves not only as a major matrix material for the microneedle tips, but also as a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that facilitates the intracellular accumulation of the antibiotic doxycycline (DOX) by increasing bacterial cell membrane permeability. Furthermore, the formation of physically crosslinked networks of EPL affords microneedle tips with improved formability, good mechanical properties, and amorphous nanoparticles (approximately 7.2Â nm) of encapsulated DOX. As a result, a high total loading content of both antimicrobials up to 2319.1Â Î¼g/patch is achieved for efficient transdermal drug delivery. In a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced deep cutaneous infection model, the EPL microneedles demonstrates potent and long-term effects by synergistically enhancing antibiotic activities and prolonging drug retention in infected lesions, resulting in remarkable therapeutic efficacy with 99.91Â % (3.04 log) reduction in skin bacterial burden after a single administration. Overall, our study highlights the distinct advantages of EPL microneedles and their potential in clinical antibacterial practice when loaded with amorphous DOX nanoparticles.",

        "Abstract": "The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) signal is largely determined by the electron transfer efficiency. Therefore, in the nanomaterial-involved ECL system, the structure-related electron distribution could affect the electron transfer efficiency and further alter the ECL intensity. These features make the design of versatile ECL-based analytical techniques for probing the correlated structure possible. And it is generally accepted that the increased crystallinity of nanomaterials usually leads to a uniform electron distribution, which provides higher conductivity. Therefore, the crystallinity-improved conductivity could facilitate electron transfer, promote the electrochemical activity of support materials, and boost the efficiency of the ECL reaction. In this study, we have demonstrated that the ECL signal of the graphitic carbon nitride reporter was proportional to the crystallinity of layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which meets the supposition well. On the basis of this phenomenon, an ECL-based crystallinity analysis approach has been established using CdAl-LDHs as the model materials. The universality of this proposed technique was further validated by the rapid and accurate crystallinity determination of ZnAl-LDH samples with diverse crystallinities. This work not only contributes an alternative to the X-ray diffraction technique for the rapid screening of crystallinity in layered materials but also opens a new avenue for the design of ECL-based structure analysis techniques toward nanomaterials and even organic materials by involving electron transfer regulation correlation.",

        "Abstract": "A digital pre-distortion (DPD) scheme based on an adaptive-memory-length look-up table (AML-LUT) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated in a four-level pulse amplitude modulation (4-PAM) underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) system. By implementing adaptive memory length for each pattern in the AML-LUT-based DPD, the size of the AML-LUT can be significantly reduced without sacrificing performance compared to both the full-size LUT and the multi-symbol simplified look-up table (MSS-LUT)-based DPDs. The performance of the proposed AML-LUT-based DPD is experimentally evaluated for a 625 Mbit/s 4-PAM UOWC over 1 m transmission length. Experimental results show that compared with the full-size LUT with a memory length of 7 (LUT-7)-based DPD, the proposed AML-LUT-based DPD (i) incurs a marginal power penalty of 0.5âdB at both the 7% hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) and KP4-FEC threshold limits, while simultaneously reducing the implementation complexity (i.e., the LUT size) by 93%; (ii) achieves comparable transmission performance compared to the MSS-LUT-based DPD, while reducing the implementation complexity by 89%; and (iii) shows great potential for high-speed, low-complexity and memory-efficient intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) UOWC and short-reach optical interconnects.",

However, their high-rate capability and mechanical properties are limited because of unsatisfactory ion transfer kinetics and interfacial modulus mismatch inside devices. Here, we develop a metal-organic framework interface with superior electrical and mechanical properties for supercapacitors. The interfacial mechanism facilitates ultrafast ion transfer with an energy barrier reduction of 43% compared with that of conventional transmembrane transport. It delivers high specific capacity at a wide rate range and exhibits ultrastability beyond 30000 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, meliorative modulus mismatch benefited from ultrathin interface design that improves mechanical properties of flexible supercapacitors. It delivers a stable energy supply under various mechanical conditions like bending and twisting status and displays ultrastable mechanical properties with performance retention of 95.5% after 10â¯000 bending cycles. The research paves the way for interfacial engineering for ultrastable electrochemical devices.",

        "Abstract": "It is essential to probe the coordination number (CN) because it is a crucial factor to ensure the catalytic capability of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Currently, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely used to measure the CN. However, the scarcity of synchrotron X-ray source and complicated data analysis restrict its wide applications in determining the CN of SACs. In this contribution, we have developed a d-band center-regulated acetone cataluminescence (CTL) probe for a rapid screening of the CN of Pt-SACs. It is disclosed that the CN-triggered CTL is attributed to the fact that the increased CN could induce the downward shift of d-band center position, which assists the acetone adsorption and promotes the subsequent catalytic reaction. In addition, the universality of the proposed acetone-CTL probe is verified by determining the CN of Fe-SACs. This work has opened a new avenue for exploring an alternative to synchrotron XAS for the determination of CN of SACs and even conventional metal catalysts through d-band center-regulated CTL.",

        "Abstract": "Turbulent motion is the essential difference between the atmospheric boundary layer and the free atmosphere. Due to the lack of detection methods for vertical turbulent structures, commonly used methods usually focus on material distribution, thermal effects, or dynamic effects, and they fail to reflect the boundary layer objectively in terms of turbulence. Therefore, to date, the acquisition and characteristic analysis of the atmospheric boundary layer height under turbulent angles have not been achieved. This study proposes a method for obtaining the height of the boundary layer based on the power-law exponent of atmospheric turbulence. The proposed method is validated and analyzed with data from radiosondes obtained under sunny, cloudy, and light rain weather conditions, demonstrating its advantages. With the proposed method, the first published acquisition of boundary layer height characteristics based on turbulent motion is achieved, including a statistical analysis of the daily and monthly variation characteristics of the boundary layer height over the Shenzhen area in China. Moreover, different oscillation frequencies of the boundary layer height under different wind directions are revealed. The results of this study break the traditional bottleneck of not being able to obtain the height of the boundary layer based on turbulence, and provide a new perspective for the acquisition and research of the boundary layer height.",

        "Abstract": "The Single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq) has gained increasing popularity in recent years, allowing for chromatin accessibility to be deciphered and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to be inferred at single-cell resolution. This cutting-edge technology now enables the genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility at the cellular level and the capturing of cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that are masked by cellular heterogeneity in bulk assays. Additionally, it can also facilitate the identification of rare and new cell types based on differences in chromatin accessibility and the charting of cellular developmental trajectories within lineage-related cell clusters. Due to technical challenges and limitations, the data generated from scATAC-seq exhibit unique features, often characterized by high sparsity and noise, even within the same cell type. To address these challenges, various bioinformatic tools have been developed. Furthermore, the application of scATAC-seq in plant science is still in its infancy, with most research focusing on root tissues and model plant species. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in scATAC-seq and its application across various fields. We first conduct scATAC-seq in plant science. Next, we highlight the current challenges of scATAC-seq in plant science and major strategies for cell type annotation. Finally, we outline several future directions to exploit scATAC-seq technologies to address critical challenges in plant science, ranging from plant ENCODE(The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project construction to GRN inference, to deepen our understanding of the roles of CREs in plant biology.",

        "Abstract": "It remains a significant challenge to develop a kind of cost-effective and eco-friendly adsorbent with strong immobilization capabilities for ammonium in farmland. In this work, we employed Ca/Al layered double hydroxide-supported carbon dots (CDs@Ca/Al-LDHs) as a novel and efficient adsorbent for ammonium immobilization both in aqueous and soil environments. Such a composite could exhibit a high adsorption capacity towards ammonium in solution, which was four times higher than zeolite and three times higher than biochar under the same conditions. The mechanism investigations revealed that electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged CDs and the positively charged ammonium played a key role in the adsorption. In 30-day leaching experiments, the fabricated composite cumulatively reduced ammonium and nitrate by 6.3% and 9.7%, respectively at a dosage of 0.1% (w/w). Incubation experiments further confirmed that the developed composite could effectively inhibit ammonia volatilization and nitrification by immobilizing the ammonium within soil matrices. Our results demonstrated that CDs@Ca/Al-LDHs represented a promising candidate for cost-effective and eco-friendly immobilization of excess ammonium from over-fertilized farmland.",

        "Abstract": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a prevalent orthopedic issue, leading to the collapse and fragmentation of the femoral head in its advanced stages, which can severely impair patients' quality of life. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a clinical intervention frequently used to alleviate ONFH symptoms and reinstate hip functionality. The conventional surgical technique is invasive and comes with an extended recuperation period, posing significant challenges for patients. With the progression of medical technology, the use of the mini-incision technique in minimally invasive THA (MITHA) has become more prevalent. However, comparative studies examining the effectiveness of these two surgical procedures in treating ONFH remain scarce. Furthermore, understanding patients' psychological well-being is crucial given its profound influence on postoperative recuperation.",

        "Abstract": "Water in organic solvents is a prevalent impurity that significantly influences chemical reactions and industrial processes. Carbon dots (CDs) gained attention as promising tools for chemosensing due to their advantageous characteristics, including easy synthesis, cost-effectiveness, and excellent adjustability and stability. However, limited solubility in water and turn off fluorescence response mode hinder the practical utilization of CDs for water sensing. To tackle such dilemma, a highly water-soluble CDs with distinctive hydrogen-bond-induced emission (HBIE) was rationally designed through introducing sulfone group into the widely employed p-phenylenediamine precursor. The inclusion of sulfone group imparts the CDs with notable water solubility, as well as distinctive ratiometric fluorescent response towards water content, exhibiting high sensitivity and selectivity. Upon exposure to water, the emission color of CDs undergoes a real-time transition from blue to yellow-green, which can be readily discerned by naked eyes. The CDs have been successfully applied in detecting water in commercially available alcohol. This study presents a straightforward yet efficacious approach for rationally design of CDs with unique HBIE characteristics and ratiometric fluorescent response, offering great potential for practical chemosensing applications.",

        "Abstract": "The interplay between metabolism and chromatin signaling is implicated in cancer progression. However, whether and how metabolic reprogramming in tumors generates chromatin vulnerabilities remain unclear. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors frequently harbor aberrant activation of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway, which drives aggressive and chemo-resistant disease. Using a chromatin-focused CRISPR screen, we report that NRF2 activation sensitizes LUAD cells to genetic and chemical inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). This association is observed across cultured cells, mouse models, and patient-derived xenografts. Integrative epigenomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analysis demonstrates that HDAC inhibition causes widespread redistribution of H4ac and its reader protein, which transcriptionally downregulates metabolic enzymes. This results in reduced flux into amino acid metabolism and de novo nucleotide synthesis pathways that are preferentially required for the survival of NRF2-active cancer cells. Together, our findings suggest NRF2 activation as a potential biomarker for effective repurposing of HDAC inhibitors to treat solid tumors.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to understand the prevalence of hyperuricemia and MetS in the United States and evaluate the potential effect of gender and ethnicity on hyperuricemia and MetS. Data was obtained from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2011 and 2018. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to investigate the association between hyperuricemia and MetS. A total of 7273 participants with an average age of 47.59Â Â±Â 16.92Â years old were enrolled in our analysis. Of all the people, 1833 were diagnosed with MetS, with which 547 (29.8Â %) were found with hyperuricemia. As for gender, 261 (28.3Â %) females were with both Mets and hyperuricemia and this number came to 286 (31.4Â %) for males.For population distribution, Non-Hispanic American white, and Hispanic American making up 61.2Â % of the cohort. The logistic regression analysis showed that there was a significant association between MetS and hyperuricemia (ORÂ =Â 2.608, 95Â %CI: 2.281-2.982). And the relationship still existed between both males (ORÂ =Â 2.172, 95Â %CI: 1.829-2.579) and females (ORÂ =Â 3.464, 95Â %CI: 2.868-4.185); in addition, participant's ethnicity was also found to play an important role. And the association was found either in Hispanic Americans Non-Hispanic Americans White and black or from other races. In conclusion, our study found a significant association between hyperuricemia and MetS. The higher the uric acid level, the greater risk of people getting MetS and this risk was not influenced by people's gender and ethnicity.",

        "Abstract": "Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated histone H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) recruits canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) to maintain heterochromatin. In early development, polycomb-regulated genes are connected through long-range 3D interactions which resolve upon differentiation. Here, we report that polycomb looping is controlled by H3K27me3 spreading and regulates target gene silencing and cell fate specification. Using glioma-derived H3 Lys-27-Met (H3K27M) mutations as tools to restrict H3K27me3 deposition, we show that H3K27me3 confinement concentrates the chromatin pool of cPRC1, resulting in heightened 3D interactions mirroring chromatin architecture of pluripotency, and stringent gene repression that maintains cells in progenitor states to facilitate tumor development. Conversely, H3K27me3 spread in pluripotent stem cells, following neural differentiation or loss of the H3K36 methyltransferase NSD1, dilutes cPRC1 concentration and dissolves polycomb loops. These results identify the regulatory principles and disease implications of polycomb looping and nominate histone modification-guided distribution of reader complexes as an important mechanism for nuclear compartment organization.",

        "Title": "Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites: From Material Engineering to Flexible Applications.",
        "Abstract": "ConspectusIonic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) are one kind of artificial muscles that can realize energy conversions in response to external stimulus with merits of lightweight, scalability, quick response, and flexibility and have been treated as an important platform in artificial intelligence, such as bionic robotics, smart sensors, and micro-electromechanical systems. It is well-known that IPMC devices are mainly composed of one electrolyte layer laminated with symmetric electrode layers and realize energy conversion based on ion migration and redistribution inside the devices. However, several critical issues have greatly impeded the practical applications of IPMC devices, including metal electrode cracks, metal-polymer interface detachment, and water loss in the electrolyte. In the past decade, our group and collaborators have made attempts to address the mentioned critical issues with the purpose of accelerating practical applications of IPMC devices. First, in order to address the metal electrode cracks, we have developed various electrode materials to replace the metal electrode material, such as black phosphorus and graphdiyne. These materials display superior electrical and mechanical properties with enhanced material stability without cracking. Second, to address metal-polymer interface detachment, we have designed robust interfaces for IMPC devices with vertical array structures. The as-prepared interfaces present high ionic conductivity with excellent mechanical stability under bending states. As a result, the IPMC devices deliver high working stability exceeding a million cycles under air conditions. Third, in order to avoid water loss in the electrolyte, especially at ambient conditions, we have developed ionogel electrolytes containing highly stable ionic liquids as active ion sources. The ionogel electrolytes effectively prevent water loss in conventional water-containing electrolytes, just like Nafion electrolytes and greatly improve the working stability of IPMC devices. After addressing the key issues of IPMC devices, we finally obtained many high-performing IPMC devices and explored various intelligent applications of them. For instance, we have demonstrated the smart functions of IPMC devices as sensitive strain sensors, such as sign language recognition, handwriting detection, and human muscle monitoring. In addition, we have developed bionic flying robots with a vibration frequency as high as 30 Hz with the aid of high-performance IPMC actuators. A medical catheter based on IPMC actuators has been put forward by our group and can realize multiple degrees of freedom deformation under a low driving voltage of 2.5 V, which presents great potential for application in medical instruments. Lastly, a perspective on critical challenges and future research directions on IPMC materials and devices is highlighted for accelerating practical application.",

        "Abstract": "In our previous studies, we demonstrated that merazin hydrate (MH) had rapid antidepressant effects, but the deep mechanism needed to be further investigated. In this study, we used depressive-like model, behavioral tests, molecular biology and pharmacological interventions to reveal the underlying mechanisms of MH's rapid antidepressants. We found that a single administration of MH was able to produce rapid antidepressant effects in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) exposed mice at 1Â day later, similar to ketamine. Moreover, MH could not only significantly up-regulated the expressions of cFOS, but also obviously increased the number of Ki67 positive cells in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Furthermore, we also found that the phosphorylated expression of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was significantly reduced by CUMS in hippocampus, which was also reversed by MH. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII by using KN-93 (a CaMKII antagonist) blocked the MH's up-regulation of cFOS and Ki67 in hippocampal DG. To sum up, this study demonstrated that MH produced rapid antidepressant effects by activating CaMKII to promote neuronal activities and proliferation in hippocampus.",

        "Abstract": "Computational techniques can speed up the identification of hits and accelerate the development of candidate molecules for drug discovery. Among techniques for predicting relative binding affinities, the most consistently accurate is free energy perturbation (FEP), a class of rigorous physics-based methods. However, uncertainty remains about how accurate FEP is and can ever be. Here, we present what we believe to be the largest publicly available dataset of proteins and congeneric series of small molecules, and assess the accuracy of the leading FEP workflow. To ascertain the limit of achievable accuracy, we also survey the reproducibility of experimental relative affinity measurements. We find a wide variability in experimental accuracy and a correspondence between binding and functional assays. When careful preparation of protein and ligand structures is undertaken, FEP can achieve accuracy comparable to experimental reproducibility. Throughout, we highlight reliable protocols that can help maximize the accuracy of FEP in prospective studies.",

        "Abstract": "The selective recognition of dopamine (DA) over other neurotransmitter analogues is difficult due to the similar molecular structure and chemical reactivity. In this study, substitution-regulated chemical reactivity of the sensing substrate is utilized to explore a novel DA detection probe with satisfying selectivity. As a case study, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA, carboxy-substituted resorcinol)-based probes have been explored for selective and ratiometric DA sensing. The carboxy substitution benefits the stabilization of the carbanion intermediate and the azamonardine product, which enhances the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics and subsequently facilitates selective DA recognition over other analogues and interferents. By exploring DHBA emission as the internal reference, ratiometric fluorescence variation is realized, which contributes to sensitive DA analysis. With the combination of logic gate and fluorometric analysis, DA detection in both low and high concentrations can be readily achieved. In addition, the DA analysis in biological samples and the enzymatic transformation of DA analogues in cerebrospinal fluid samples are achieved by the proposed DHBA probe.",

Soil bacterial community structure plays an important role in vegetable residue return and is susceptible to environmental changes. Therefore, understanding the influences of different soil water holding capacities on plant residue decomposition and soil bacterial communities is important for biodegradation. During the whole incubation period, the weight loss ratio of plant residue with 100% water holding capacity was 69.60 to 75.27%, which was significantly higher than that with 60% water holding capacity in clay and sandy soil, indicating that high water holding capacity promoted the decomposition of plant residue. The degradation of lignin and cellulose was also promoted within 14 days. Furthermore, with the increase in soil water holding capacity, the contents of NH",

        "Abstract": "A novel inline Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) for simultaneous relative humidity (RH) and temperature monitoring is proposed. The sensing probe consists of a section of hollow core Bragg fiber (HCBF) spliced with a single-mode fiber pigtail. The end-face of the HCBF is coated with Chitosan and ultraviolet optical adhesive (UVOA), forming two polymer layers using a well-designed fabrication process. The surfaces of the layers and splicing point will generate multiple-beam interference and form Vernier-effect (VE) related envelopes in the reflection spectrum. A signal processing (SP) method is proposed to demodulate the VE envelopes from a complicated superimposed raw spectrum. The principle of the SP algorithm is analyzed theoretically and verified experimentally. The sensor's RH and temperature response are studied, exhibiting a high sensitivity of about 0.437 nm/%RH and 0.29 nm/ ",

        "Abstract": "We present the development and application of a multilayer microfluidic lung chip designed to accurately replicate the human respiratory bronchi, providing an innovative platform for controlled particle deposition in the lung. By employing a quantitative control method of fluid velocity through the deformation of an elastic PDMS membrane, this platform mimics the passive breathing process in humans and allows for precise simulation of the respiration cycle. We utilized time-lapse photography of fluorescent particles in a water/glycerol solution to qualitatively observe fluid morphology in the channel, while a chip-aerosol exposure device combined with microscopy imaging was employed to visualise aerosol deposition. Both experimental and numerical simulation results showed that particle concentration decreased towards the distal generations of the lung, and that changes in breathing pattern significantly affected particle deposition trends. Furthermore, we found that increasing the residence time of particles in the channel facilitated deeper particle deposition, achievable by adjusting parameters such as breath-hold time, exhalation time, respiration cycle length, and tidal volume. The proposed microfluidic lung chip device has significant potential for future research in respiratory health and inhaled drug delivery, providing an efficient, cost-effective, and ethical alternative to traditional ",

In this work, we demonstrate a covalent cross-linking strategy to engineer mechanical-robust room temperature phosphorescence materials through the B-O click reaction between chromophores, polyvinyl alcohol matrix and inorganic layered double hydroxide nanosheets. Through the covalent cross-linkage between the organic polyvinyl alcohol and inorganic layered double hydroxide, a polymeric composite with ultralong lifetime up to 1.45âs is acquired based on the inhibited non-radiative transition of chromophores. Simultaneously, decent mechanical strength of 97.9âMPa can be realized for the composite materials due to the dissipated loading stress through the covalent-bond-accommodated interfacial interaction. These cross-linked composites also exhibit flexibility, processability, scalability and phosphorescence responses towards the mechanical deformation. It is anticipated that the proposed covalent click reaction could provide a platform for the design and modulation of composites with multi-functionality and long-term durability.",

        "Abstract": "Interplay between chromatin-associated complexes and modifications critically contribute to the partitioning of epigenome into stable and functionally distinct domains. Yet there is a lack of systematic identification of chromatin crosstalk mechanisms, limiting our understanding of the dynamic transition between chromatin states during development and disease. Here we perform co-dependency mapping of genes using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated fitness screens in pan-cancer cell lines to quantify gene-gene functional relationships. We identify 145 co-dependency modules and further define the molecular context underlying the essentiality of these modules by incorporating mutational, epigenome, gene expression and drug sensitivity profiles of cell lines. These analyses assign new protein complex composition and function, and predict new functional interactions, including an unexpected co-dependency between two transcriptionally counteracting chromatin complexes - polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and MLL-MEN1 complex. We show that PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation regulates the genome-wide distribution of MLL1 and MEN1. In lymphoma cells with EZH2 gain-of-function mutations, the re-localization of MLL-MEN1 complex drives oncogenic gene expression and results in a hypersensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of MEN1. Together, our findings provide a resource for discovery of trans-regulatory interactions as mechanisms of chromatin regulation and potential targets of synthetic lethality.",

        "Abstract": "The successful preparation of supramolecular block copolymers (SBCPs) by living supramolecular assembly technology requires two kinetic systems in which both the seed (nucleus) and heterogenous monomer providers are in non-equilibrium. However, employing simple monomers to construct the SBCPs via this technology is almost impossible because the low spontaneous nucleation barrier of simple molecules prevents the formation of kinetic states. Here, with the help of confinement from layered double hydroxide (LDH), various simple monomers successfully form living supramolecular co-assemblies (LSCA). LDH overcomes a considerable energy barrier to obtain living seeds to support the growth of the inactivated second monomer. The ordered LDH topology is sequentially mapped to the seed, second monomer, and binding sites. Thus, the multidirectional binding sites are endowed with the ability to branch, making the branch length of dendritic LSCA reach its maximum value of 3.5 cm so far. The strategy of universality will guide exploration into the development of multi-function and multi-topology advanced supramolecular co-assemblies.",

        "Abstract": "The U6 promoter is an important element driving sgRNA transcription in the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Seven PqU6 promo-ter sequences were cloned from the gDNA of Panax quinquefolium, and the transcriptional activation ability of the seven promoters was studied. In this study, seven PqU6 promoter sequences with a length of about 1 300 bp were cloned from the adventitious roots of P. quinquefolium cultivated for 5 weeks. Bioinformatics tools were used to analyze the sequence characteristics of PqU6 promoters, and the fusion expression vectors of GUS gene driven by PqU6-P were constructed. Tobacco leaves were transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated method for activity detection. The seven PqU6 promoters were truncated from the 5'-end to reach 283, 287, 279, 289, 295, 289, and 283 bp, respectively. The vectors for detection of promoter activity were constructed with GUS as a reported gene and used to transform P. quinquefolium callus and tobacco leaves. The results showed that seven PqU6 promoter sequences(PqU6-1P to PqU6-7P) were cloned from the gDNA of P. quinquefolium, with the length ranged from 1 246 bp to 1 308 bp. Sequence comparison results showed that the seven PqU6 promoter sequences and the AtU6-P promoter all had USE and TATA boxes, which are essential elements affecting the transcriptional activity of the U6 promoter. The results of GUS staining and enzyme activity test showed that all the seven PqU6 promoters had transcriptional activity. The PqU6-7P with a length of 1 269 bp had the highest transcriptional activity, 1.31 times that of the positive control P-35S. When the seven PqU6 promoters were truncated from the 5'-end(PqU6-1PA to PqU6-7PA), their transcriptional activities were different in tobacco leaves and P. quinquefolium callus. The transcriptional activity of PqU6-7PA promoter(283 bp) was 1.59 times that of AtU6-P promoter(292 bp) when the recipient material was P. quinquefolium callus. The findings provide more ideal endogenous U6 promoters for CRISPR/Cas9 technology in ginseng and other medicinal plants.",

        "Abstract": "Chromatic dispersion (CD) is always an obstacle to C-band high-speed intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) transmissions, especially with a fiber reach of > 20 km. To reach beyond net-100-Gb/s IM/DD transmission over 50-km standard single mode fiber (SSMF), we for the first time present a CD-aware probabilistically shaped four-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PS-PAM-4) signal transmission scheme with a FIR-filter-based pre-electronic dispersion compensation (FIR-EDC) for C-band IM/DD transmission system. With the help of the FIR-EDC at the transmitter, 100-GBaud PS-PAM-4 signal transmission at 150-Gb/s line rate and 115.2-Gb/s net rate over 50-km SSMF is realized with only feed-forward equalization (FFE) at the receiver side. The superiority of the CD-aware PS-PAM-4 signal transmission scheme over other benchmark schemes has been successfully verified by experiments. Experimental results show that 24.5% improvement of system capacity is obtained by the FIR-EDC-based PS-PAM-4 signal transmission scheme in comparison to the FIR-EDC-based on-off keying (OOK) signal transmission scheme. Compared with the FIR-EDC-based uniform PAM-4 signal transmission scheme or the PS-PAM-4 signal transmission scheme without EDC, the capacity improvement obtained by the FIR-EDC-based PS-PAM-4 signal transmission scheme becomes more profound. The results show the potential and feasibility of such CD-aware PS-PAM-4 signal transmission scheme applied in CD-constrained IM/DD datacenter interconnects.",

        "Abstract": "Rayleigh scattering-based distributed optical fiber sensors with long sensing distance and large dynamic range are highly desired for application scenarios such as vehicle tracking, structure health monitoring, and geological survey. To enlarge the dynamic range, we propose a coherent optical time domain reflectometry (COTDR) based on double-sideband linear frequency modulation (LFM) pulse. By utilizing I/Q demodulation, both the positive and negative frequency band of the Rayleigh backscattering (RBS) signal can be properly demodulated. Consequently, the dynamic range is doubled without increasing the bandwidth of signal generator, photodetector (PD), and oscilloscope. In the experiment, the chirped pulse with 10 Î¼s pulse width and 498âMHz frequency sweeping range is launched into the sensing fiber. Single-shot strain measurement is achieved over 5âkm single-mode fiber with a spatial resolution of 2.5 m and a strain sensitivity of 7.5 pÎµ/",

        "Abstract": "Homochiral supramolecular assembly (HSA) based on achiral molecules has provided important clues to understand the origin of biological homochirality from the aspect of symmetry breaking. However, planar achiral molecules still face the challenge of forming HSA due to the lack of driving force for twisted stacking, which is a prerequisite for homochirality. Here, with the benefit of the formation of 2D intercalated layered double hydroxide (LDH, host-guest nanomaterials) in vortex motion, planar achiral guest molecules can form the chiral units with spatially asymmetrical structure in the confinement space of LDH. Once the LDH is removed, these chiral units are in a thermodynamic non-equilibrium state, which can be amplified to HSA by self-replicating. Especially, the homochiral bias can be predicted in advance by controlling the vortex direction. Therefore, this study breaks the bottleneck of complicated molecular design and provides a new technology to achieve HSA made of planar achiral molecules with definite handedness.",

In this Letter, a simple but versatile scheme of mode group (MG) filtering for MGDM IM/DD transmission is proposed. The scheme is applicable to any mode basis in the fiber, and it satisfies the needs of low complexity, low power consumption, and high system performance. By employing the proposed MG filter scheme, a total raw bit rate of a 152-Gb/s multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-free IM/DD co-channel simultaneous transmit and receive system based on two orbital angular momentum (OAM) MGs, each carrying a 38-GBaud four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) signal, is experimentally demonstrated over a 5-km few-mode fiber (FMF). The bit error ratios (BERs) of the two MGs are below the 7% hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) BER threshold at 3.8Ã10",

        "Abstract": "An important public concern worldwide is soil pollution caused by organophosphorus pesticides and their primary metabolites. To protect the public's health, screening these pollutants on-site and determining their soil bioavailability is important, but doing so is still challenging. This work improved the already-existing organophosphorus pesticide hydrolase (mpd) and transcriptional activator (pobR), and it first designed and constructed a novel biosensor (Escherichia coli BL21/pNP-LacZ) that can precisely detect methyl parathion (MP) and its primary metabolite p-nitrophenol with low background value. To create a paper strip biosensor, E. coli BL21/pNP-LacZ was fixed to filter paper using bio-gel alginate and sensitizer polymyxin B. According to the calibrations of the paper strip biosensor for soil extracts and standard curve, the color intensity of the paper strip biosensor collected by the mobile app may be used to compute the concentration of MP and p-nitrophenol. This method's detection limits were 5.41Â Âµg/kg for p-nitrophenol and 9.57Â Âµg/kg for MP. The detection of p-nitrophenol and MP in laboratory and field soil samples confirmed this procedure. Paper strip biosensor on-site allows for the semi-quantitative measurement of p-nitrophenol and MP levels in soils in a simple, inexpensive, and portable method.",

        "Abstract": "Interplay between metabolism and chromatin signaling have been implicated in cancer initiation and progression. However, whether and how metabolic reprogramming in tumors generates specific epigenetic vulnerabilities remain unclear. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors frequently harbor mutations that cause aberrant activation of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway and drive aggressive and chemo-resistant disease. We performed a chromatin-focused CRISPR screen and report that NRF2 activation sensitized LUAD cells to genetic and chemical inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDAC). This association was consistently observed across cultured cells, syngeneic mouse models and patient-derived xenografts. HDAC inhibition causes widespread increases in histone H4 acetylation (H4ac) at intergenic regions, but also drives re-targeting of H4ac reader protein BRD4 away from promoters with high H4ac levels and transcriptional downregulation of corresponding genes. Integrative epigenomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis demonstrates that these chromatin changes are associated with reduced flux into amino acid metabolism and ",

        "Abstract": "A receive-diversity-aided power-fading compensation (RDA-PFC) scheme is proposed and demonstrated to eliminate the chromatic dispersion (CD)-induced power fading for C-band double-sideband (DSB) intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. By combining the responses before and after a dispersive element using a maximal-ratio combining (MRC) algorithm, the CD-induced power fading dips within the signal bandwidth of around 50âGHz can be effectively compensated for, which results in an up to 17.6-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement for the fading subcarriers after transmission over 10 km of standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). Using the 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) format, a diversity receiver with the proposed RDA-PFC scheme can support 170.6-Gbit/s OFDM signal transmission over a 10-km SSMF and reduces the bit error rate (BER) by more than an order of magnitude compared with a conventional receiver. Moreover, 208.1-Gbit/s adaptive bit and power loading OFDM signal transmission over a 10-km SSMF is realized by the proposed RDA-PFC scheme, which improves the capacity by 15.3% compared with the case without RDA-PFC at a BER of 3.8âÃâ10",

Under the guidance of aggregology and the Jablonski energy level diagram, photosensitizer aggregates with tunable photophysical properties can consequently result in tailorable diagnosis and treatment modalities.

By sandwiching a segment of HCBF between the lead-in single-mode fiber (SMF) and the hollow core fiber (HCF), a cascaded Fabry-Perot interferometer is produced. The lengths of the HCBF and HCF are precisely optimized and controlled to generate the VE, achieving a high sensitivity of the sensor. Meanwhile, a digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm is proposed to research the mechanism of the VE envelope, thus providing an effective way to improve the sensor's dynamic range based on calibrating the order of the dip. Theoretical simulations are investigated and matched well with the experimental results. The proposed sensor exhibits a maximum gas pressure sensitivity of 150.02 nm/MPa with a low temperature cross talk of 0.00235 MPa/ ",

        "Abstract": "Measuring the release dynamics of drug molecules after their delivery to the target organelle is critical to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects. However, it remains challenging to quantitatively monitor subcellular drug release in real time. To address the knowledge gap, a novel gemini fluorescent surfactant capable of forming mitochondria-targeted and redox-responsive nanocarriers is designed. A quantitative FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) platform is fabricated using this mitochondria-anchored fluorescent nanocarrier as a FRET donor and fluorescent drugs as a FRET acceptor. The FRET platform enables real-time measurement of drug release from organelle-targeted nanocarriers. Moreover, the obtained drug release dynamics can evaluate the duration of drug release at the subcellular level, which established a new quantitative method for organelle-targeted drug release. This quantitative FRET platform can compensate for the absent assessment of the targeted release performances of nanocarriers, offering in-depth understanding of the drug release behaviors at the subcellular targets.",

However, their sensing properties are limited by a weak material interface based on physical adhesion, which usually leads to fast performance deterioration under mechanical conditions. In this work, a bio-inspired interface has been reported based on an in situ growth strategy and then utilized for piezoionic sensor assembly. The robust coupling interface provides fast kinetic of ion transfer and prevents interface slippage under external strains. The as-fabricated sensors give high sensing voltage with high sensitivity. It delivers excellent cycling stability with performance retention above 90% over thousands of bending cycles in air. Further, the sensors have been explored as an effective platform for skin perception, and many detections can be realized within our devices, such as skin touch, eye movement, cheek bulging, and finger movement.",

        "Abstract": "In order to solve the difficulty in localization and poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the angled shear vertical wave (SV wave) electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) in cracks detection of high-temperature carbon steel forgings, a finite element (FE) model of the angled SV wave EMAT detection process was established, and the influence of specimen temperature on the EMAT excitation, propagation, and reception processes was analyzed. A high-temperature resistant angled SV wave EMAT was designed to detect carbon steel from 20 Â°C to 500 Â°C, and the influence law of the angled SV wave at different temperatures was analyzed. Then a circuit-field coupled FE model of angled SV wave EMAT in the carbon steel detection process based on the Barker code pulse compression technique was established, and the effects of the Barker code element length, impedance matching method, and matching component parameters on the pulse compression effect were analyzed. In addition, the noise suppression effect and the SNR of the crack-reflected wave in the tone-burst excitation method and the Barker code pulse compression technique were compared. The results show that the amplitude of the block-corner reflected wave decreases from 556 mV to 195 mV, and the SNR decreases from 34.9 dB to 23.5 dB when the specimen temperature increases from 20 Â°C to 500 Â°C. When the temperature is 500 Â°C, the SNR of the crack-reflected wave obtained by the Barker code pulse compression technique can be improved by 9.2 dB compared to the tone-burst excitation method with 16 synchronous averages. The study can provide technical and theoretical guidance for online crack detection for high-temperature carbon steel forgings.",

        "Abstract": "Cocrystallization technology can effectively regulate crystal structure, alter packing mode, and improve physicochemical performances of energetic materials at molecule level. CL-20/HMX cocrystal explosive has high energy density than HMX, but it also exhibits high mechanical sensitivity. To decrease the sensitivity and improve the properties of CL-20/HMX energetic cocrystal, the three-component energetic cocrystal CL-20/HMX/TNAD was designed. The properties of CL-20, CL-20/HMX, and CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal models were predicted. The results show that CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal models have better mechanical properties than CL-20/HMX cocrystal model, implying that the mechanical properties can be effectively improved. The binding energy of CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal models is higher than CL-20/HMX cocrystal model, indicating that the three-component energetic cocrystal is more stable, and the cocrystal model with the ratio 3:4:1 is predicted to be the most stable phase. CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal models have higher value of trigger bond energy than pure CL-20 and CL-20/HMX cocrystal models, meaning that the three-component energetic cocrystal is more insensitive. The crystal density and detonation parameters of CL-20/HMX and CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal models are lower than CL-20, illustrating that the energy density is declined. The CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal has higher energy density than RDX and can be regarded as a potential high energy explosive.",

Depending on the stimuli, macrophages can be polarised into two subtypes of macrophages with completely different phenotypes and functions, namely M1 and M2. The aim of this study was to explore the role of M1 and M2 macrophages in skin healing in order to develop new drugs for the treatment of refractory wounds. Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated from rats and expanded in vitro using macrophage colony stimulating factor. In addition, the BMDMs were polarised into the M1 and M2 subtypes using lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), respectively. Cytokine levels in the culture supernatants were measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Epidermal wounds were made on the dorsal surface of rats, and treated with M1 or M2 cell suspensions or phosphate buffered saline. Wound healing was recorded on days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 after stamping, and the wound healing rate was measured by haematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. A total of 3 to 4Â Ãâ10",

        "Title": "Chiral Hierarchical Architecture Induced by Confinement-Assisted Living Supramolecular Polymerization of Simple Achiral Molecules.",
        "Abstract": "Chiral supramolecular assembly (CSA) based on achiral molecules has provided important clues to understand the origin of biological chirality. However, a simple achiral monomer faces the challenge of chiral stacking with the absence of a chiral resource. The difficulty is that simple achiral monomer lacks steric repulsion to provide asymmetry during hierarchical assembly, which is a prerequisite for chiral stacking with an angle. Moreover, during chiral stacking of achiral molecules or units, the right-handed and left-handed chiral supramolecular isomers (CSIs) are equally formed due to the mirror-imaged conformation, which leads to chirality silence. Here, with the benefit of two-dimensional confinement space of layered double hydroxide (LDH), simple achiral molecules can be arranged to staggered bilayer arrays by imprinting the topological structure of LDH. Once LDH is removed, these staggered arrays can form asymmetric living seeds, which can further elongate to living units with the advantage of living supramolecular polymerization (LSP) by following off-pathway. Due to the asymmetry of living units, the possible chiral stacking outcomes, CSIs, are not mirror-imaged. With the increase of the molecular number in living units, the energy difference between CSIs can be amplified by self-replication of LSP, leading to handedness preference. Thus, the detectable CSA is mainly derived from the CSI with energetically favored hierarchical structure. Thus, our strategy breaks the stereotype that the complex molecular structure and symmetry breaking mechanism are necessary for the formation of detectable CSA by achiral molecules.",

        "Abstract": "Patatin-related phospholipase A genes were involved in the response of Gossypium hirsutum to drought and salt tolerance. pPLA (patatin-related phospholipase A) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the initial step of lipid hydrolysis, which is involved in biological processes, such as drought, salt stress, and freezing injury. However, a comprehensive analysis of the pPLA gene family in cotton, especially the role of pPLA in the response to drought and salt tolerance, has not been reported so far. A total of 33 pPLA genes were identified in this study using a genome-wide search approach, and phylogenetic analysis classified these genes into three groups. These genes are unevenly distributed on the 26 chromosomes of cotton, and most of them contain a few introns. The results of the collinear analysis showed that G. hirsutum contained 1-5 copies of each pPLA gene found in G. arboreum and G. raimondii. The subcellular localization analysis of Gh_D08G061200 showed that the protein was localized in the nucleus. In addition, analysis of published upland cotton transcriptome data revealed that six GhPLA genes were expressed in various tissues and organs. Two genes (Gh_A04G142100.1 and Gh_D04G181000.1) were highly expressed in all tissues under normal conditions, showing the expression characteristics of housekeeping genes. Under different drought and salt tolerance stresses, we detected four genes with different expression levels. This study helps to clarify the role of pPLA in the response to drought and salt tolerance.",

They have received significant interest due to their excellent fluorescence efficiency in the aggregated state, remarkable processability, and solubility. AIE-active micelles can be designed through the self-assembly of amphipathic AIE luminogens (AIEgens) and the encapsulation of non-emissive amphipathic molecules in AIEgens. Currently, a wide range of AIE-active micelles have been constructed, with a significant increase in research interest in this area. A series of advanced techniques has been used to characterize AIE-active micelles, such as cryogenic-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). This review provides an overview of the synthesis, characterization, and applications of AIE-active micelles, especially their applications in cell and ",

        "Abstract": "Food packaging plays a vital role in protecting food products from environmental damage and preventing contamination from microorganisms. Conventional food packaging made of plastics produced from unrenewable fossil resources is hard to degrade and poses a negative impact on environmental sustainability. Natural biopolymers are attracting interest for reducing environmental problems to achieve a sustainable society, because of their abundance, biocompatibility, biodegradability, chemical stability, and non-toxicity. Active packaging systems composed of these biopolymers and biopolymer-based composites go beyond simply acting as a barrier to maintain food quality. This review provides a comprehensive overview of natural biopolymer materials used as matrices for food packaging. The antioxidant, water barrier, and oxygen barrier properties of these composites are compared and discussed. Furthermore, biopolymer-based composites integrated with antimicrobial agents-such as inorganic nanostructures and natural products-are reviewed, and the related mechanisms are discussed in terms of antimicrobial function. In summary, composites used for active food packaging systems can inhibit microbial growth and maintain food quality.",

        "Abstract": "Chromatin dysfunction has been implicated in a growing number of cancers especially in children and young adults. In addition to chromatin modifying and remodeling enzymes, mutations in histone genes are linked to human cancers. Since the first reports of hotspot missense mutations affecting key residues at histone H3 tail, studies have revealed how these so-called \"oncohistones\" dominantly (H3K27M and H3K36M) or locally (H3.3G34R/W) inhibit corresponding histone methyltransferases and misregulate epigenome and transcriptome to promote tumorigenesis. More recently, widespread mutations in all four core histones are identified in diverse cancer types. Furthermore, an \"oncohistone-like\" protein EZHIP has been implicated in driving childhood ependymomas through a mechanism highly reminiscent of H3K27M mutation. We will review recent progresses on understanding the biochemical, molecular and biological mechanisms underlying the canonical and novel histone mutations. Importantly, these mechanistic insights have identified therapeutic opportunities for oncohistone-driven tumors.",

However, little concern was given to the effect of single atoms on modulating the electronic structure of supports, despite the catalytic activities and large quantities of supports in the catalytic reactions. Herein, we have localized Ru single atoms onto two-dimensional layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) and studied the role of Ru single atoms in adjusting the electronic structure of the NiFe-LDH support. Spin polarization of 3d electrons for Fe and electron redistribution in NiFe-LDH were effectively modulated through the interaction between Ru single atoms and NiFe-LDH. As a result, the luminol redox reaction and reactive oxygen revolution were simultaneously promoted by Ru single-atom-modulated NiFe-LDH, manifested as boosted electrochemiluminescence (ECL). Therefore, we have provided valid information to reveal the regulation effect of single atoms on the spin state and electronic structure of the supports. It is anticipated that our strategy may arouse wide interest in manipulating single-atom-modulated supports.",

        "Abstract": "This study proposes a novel modified sign coherence factor (SCF) weighting adapted to the frequency-domain (FD) beamforming for ultrasound plane-wave imaging to achieve a high frame rate and better image quality. First, before beamforming, the sign components were extracted from the radiofrequency signals of aperture data. Second, the modified SCF was established using the FD beamformed sign components. Finally, the FD beamformed image was weighted by the modified SCF. To assess the performance of the proposed modified SCF for FD beamforming, the resolution, contrast, computation complexity and execution time of the generated images were evaluated. The results revealed that the FD-SCF could significantly improve the computational load compared with the classic delay-and-sum SCF on the premise of equal image quality improvement. Therefore, high image quality and low computational load have been successfully combined under the proposed weighting method.",

        "Abstract": "Primary cilia have emerged as the cellular \"antenna\" that can receive and transduce extracellular chemical/physical signals, thus playing an important role in regulating cellular activities. Although the electromagnetic field (EMF) is an effective treatment for bone fractures since 1978, however, the detailed mechanisms leading to such positive effects are still unclear. Primary cilia may play a central role in receiving EMF signals, translating physical signals into biochemical information, and initiating various signalingsignaling pathways to transduce signals into the nucleus. In this review, we elucidated the process of bone healing, the structure, and function of primary cilia, as well as the application and mechanism of EMF in treating fracture healing. To comprehensively understand the process of bone healing, we used bioinformatics to analyze the molecular change and associated the results with other studies. Moreover, this review summarizedsummarized some limitations in EMFs-related research and provides an outlook for ongoing studies. In conclusion, this review illustrated the primary cilia and related molecular mechanisms in the EMF-induced bone healing process, and it may shed light on future research.",

        "Abstract": "Crystallization-induced microscopic stress and its relaxation play a vital role in understanding crystallization behavior and mechanism. However, the real-time measurements for stress and its relaxation seem to be an unachievable task due to difficulties in simultaneous labeling, spatiotemporal discrimination, and continuous quantification. We designed a micron-sized fluorescent probe, whose fluorescence can respond to stress-induced environmental rigidity and whose three-dimensional (3D) flow can respond to stress relaxation. Using the as-prepared fluorescent probe, we established a versatile strategy to realize the real-time 3D imaging of stress and its relaxation in the crystallization process. The rigidity-responsive fluorescence clearly indicated the stress, while the 3D flow movement could quantify the stress relaxation. It is revealed that stress in spherulites increased dramatically as a result of the suppression of stress relaxation in polymer melts. The developed method provides a novel avenue to simultaneously detect stress and its relaxation in various semicrystalline polymers at the single-particle level. This success would achieve the microscopic ways to guide the development of advanced crystallization-dependent materials.",

However, the plasmon-enhanced AuNC luminescence strategies usually utilize silica as the separation layer, which requires further functionalization because the silica layer has no functional groups for in situ bonding of AuNCs. Therefore, it appears as a crucial need to develop an appropriate separation layer for the preparation of plasmon-enhanced AuNC luminescent nanomaterials.

        "Abstract": "A highly sensitive relative humidity (RH) sensor based on Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPI) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The sensor is fabricated by splicing a segment of hollow core Bragg fiber (HCBF) with single mode fiber (SMF) and functionalized with chitosan and ultraviolet optical adhesive (UVOA) composite at the end of HCBF to form a hygroscopic polymer film. The reflection beams from the splicing point and the two surfaces of the polymer film generate the Vernier effect in the reflection spectrum, which significantly improves the humidity sensitivity of the sensor. To demodulate the envelope based on the Vernier effect and realize multi-point sensing, a digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm is proposed to process the reflection spectrum. The performance of the DSP algorithm is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified. The proposed sensor demonstrates a high sensitivity of 1.45 nm/% RH for RH ranging from 45% RH to 90% RH. The compact size, high sensitivity and multiplexing capability make this sensor a promising candidate for RH monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed DSP can potentially be applied to other sensors based on the Vernier effect to analyze and extract valuable information from the interference spectrum.",

        "Abstract": "Licochalcone (LicA) is a flavonoid commonly derived from the licorice plant that is reported to have a variety of pharmacological activities. However, few studies have focused on its anti-allergic properties. IgE-mediated passive and systemic anaphylaxis mice models were used to assess the in vivo anti-allergic effect of LicA and its underlying mechanism, while degranulation, cytokines, and chemokines released from laboratory of allergic disease (LAD2) cells were used to assess its in vitro anti-allergic effect. We used western blot analysis to explore the downstream signaling pathway of its anti-allergic effect. We found that in the mouse model, LicA attenuated IgE-mediated paw inflammation, recovered the allergy-induced drop in body temperature, and reduced the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 in mouse serum in a dose-dependent manner. LicA inhibited the allergic reaction via inhibition of IgE-mediated LAD2 cell activation through the PLC/ERK/STAT3 pathway.",

        "Title": "Comparison of low-complexity sparse and weight-sharing nonlinear equalizers for C-band 100-Gbit/s DSB PAM-4 transmission over 60-km SSMF.",
        "Abstract": "To cope with the nonlinear distortions and the chromatic dispersion (CD) induced power fading in double-side band (DSB) intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) transmission systems, high-performance Volterra nonlinear equalizers (VNLEs) including Volterra feed-forward equalizer (VFFE) and Volterra decision-feedback equalizer (VDFE) are widely applied. However, the conventional VNLEs have high computational complexity, especially for longer memory lengths. In this paper, based on sparse and weight-sharing strategies for significant kernel reduction, we propose four low-complexity NLEs including a sparse diagonally pruned VDFE (S-DP-VDFE), a sparse diagonally pruned absolute-term DFE (S-DP-ATDFE), a weight-sharing DP-VDFE (WS-DP-VDFE), and a weight-sharing DP-ATDFE (WS-DP-ATDFE), and present a comprehensive comparison among them in terms of computational complexity and bit error ratio (BER) performance in a C-band 100-Gbit/s PAM-4 transmission system over 60-km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). The experimental results show that the proposed S-DP-VDFE and WS-DP-VDFE not only exhibit comparable performance with the conventional DP-VDFE but also reduce the complexity by 54.5% and 45.9%, respectively. While the proposed S-DP-ATDFE and WS-DP-ATDFE yield lower complexity at the expense of a slight performance degradation. Compared with the proposed S-DP-VDFE, S-DP-ATDFE, and WS-DP-VDFE, the proposed WS-DP-ATDFE with the lowest number of real-valued multiplications of 45 achieves up to 90.9%, 81.6%, and 95.8% complexity reduction, respectively, at the 7% hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) BER limit of 3.8âÃâ10",

        "Abstract": "In this work, a circular statistics vector (CSV) weighting Fourier domain (FD) beamforming for ultrasound plane-wave images was proposed to achieve better image quality with a high frame rate. Firstly, the cosine and sine components of the instantaneous phase are extracted from undelayed RF signals. Secondly, the FD beamformed cosine and sine components are used to establish the CSV. Finally, the FD beamformed amplitude image is weighted by the CSV. The resolution, contrast, and computation complexity were used to assess the performance of the proposed method. The results revealed that FD_CSV could significantly reduce the computational load compared to the conventional DAS_CSV on the equal improvement of image quality. Besides, compared to coherence factor (CF), phase coherence factor (PCF), etc., based on variance calculation, the CSV based on mean resultant vector calculation can effectively preserve the speckle due to the more tolerant to phase errors. The proposed FD_CSV weighting method has successfully conducted high image quality and low computational load.",

        "Abstract": "Carbon dots (CDs) have excellent optical properties, low toxicity and easy preparation, which have led to them being widely used in biomedicine, sensing and optical devices. However, although great progress has been made in the preparation of CDs, the detailed exploration of their photoluminescence (PL) mechanism is still under debate due to their complex structures and surface functionalities. Here, we proposed a single change in the pH of the synthesis condition, which had no effect on the CDs intrinsic core states and avoided the mutual influence of multiple PL origins. The m-phenylenediamine (m-PD) served as a carbon source, whose protonation degree determined the surface state of the resulting CDs and the accompanying fluorescence characteristics. The as-obtained CDs materials can be applied in the chemical sensor and anti-counterfeiting fields in a targeted manner. Therefore, our work not only contributes to the explanation of the CDs PL mechanism, but also obtains a series of CDs materials with controllable PL properties.",

        "Title": "High-sensitivity distributed relative salinity sensor based on frequency-scanning Ï-OTDR.",
        "Abstract": "In this paper, a high-sensitivity distributed optical fiber salinity sensor based on frequency-scanning phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (Ï-OTDR) and polyimide-coated single-mode fiber is proposed. Distributed salinity sensing over an 1100 m polyimide-coated fiber with a 1 m spatial resolution was demonstrated, and a sensitivity of 782.4âMHz/(mol/L) was achieved with the salinity changing from 0âmol/L to 1.61âmol/L. Then the measurement accuracies of frequency shift and salinity were evaluated theoretically and experimentally. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the measurement accuracy deteriorates as the pulse width decreases, resulting in a trade-off between the spatial resolution and measurement accuracy. The measurement uncertainty of salinity is 0.022âmol/L in the case of 30âcm spatial resolution. And when the spatial resolution is set to be 2 m, the measurement uncertainty of salinity decreases to 0.005âmol/L. The response time of the fiber to external salinity change has also been investigated, and it takes about 8 minutes for the fiber to reach a stable state. The proposed salinity sensor exhibits high sensitivity and long measurement range, which may be used for distributed marine environmental monitoring.",

        "Abstract": "How cancer-associated chromatin abnormalities shape tumor-immune interaction remains incompletely understood. Recent studies have linked DNA hypomethylation and de-repression of retrotransposons to anti-tumor immunity through the induction of interferon response. Here, we report that inactivation of the histone H3K36 methyltransferase NSD1, which is frequently found in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and induces DNA hypomethylation, unexpectedly results in diminished tumor immune infiltration. In syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of head and neck SCCs, NSD1-deficient tumors exhibit immune exclusion and reduced interferon response despite high retrotransposon expression. Mechanistically, NSD1 loss results in silencing of innate immunity genes, including the type III interferon receptor IFNLR1, through depletion of H3K36 di-methylation (H3K36me2) and gain of H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3). Inhibition of EZH2 restores immune infiltration and impairs the growth of Nsd1-mutant tumors. Thus, our work uncovers a druggable chromatin cross talk that regulates the viral mimicry response and enables immune evasion of DNA hypomethylated tumors.",

        "Abstract": "In C-band intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) systems, the frequency-dependent power fading induced by chromatic dispersion (CD) and square-law detection limits the transmission capacity and distance, especially for beyond 100-Gb/s transmissions over a 100-km dispersion-uncompensated link. To reach this goal, we propose a scheme of nonlinear pre-distortion, novel, to the best of our knowledge, combined pulse shaping, and post nonlinear equalization for four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4)-based IM/DD systems. At the transmitter, the nonlinear pre-distortion is used to generate unequally spaced PAM-4 symbols for pre-compensating the nonlinearities. While the novel pulse shaping, simply shaped by the linear combination of two inter-symbol interference (ISI)-free pulses, alters the frequency-domain power distribution of the PAM-4 signal and results in performance improvement. At the receiver, low-complexity post nonlinear equalization using an absolute-term based nonlinear equalizer with weight sharing (AT-NLE-WS) is performed to eliminate CD-induced power fading and residual nonlinear impairments. With the cooperation of these techniques, record 120-Gb/s PAM-4 signals are successfully transmitted over a 100-km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) with the measured bit error ratio (BER) below 3.8 Ã 10",

        "Abstract": "Cigarette smoking (CS) leads to several adverse health effects, including diseases, disabilities, and even death. Post-operative and trauma patients who smoke have an increased risk for complications, such as delayed bone or wound healing. In clinical trials, microcurrent (MC) has been shown to be a safe, non-invasive, and effective way to accelerate wound healing. Our study aimed to investigate if MC with the strength of 100 Î¼A may be beneficial in treating CS-related healing impairment, especially in regard to angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effect of human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT) on angiogenesis after 72 h of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure in the presence or absence of 100 Î¼A MC. Cell viability and proliferation were evaluated by resazurin conversion, Sulforhodamine B, and Calcein-AM/Hoechst 33342 staining; the pro-angiogenic potential of HaCaT cells was evaluated by tube formation assay and angiogenesis array assay; signaling pathway alterations were investigated using Western blot. Constant exposure for 72 h to a 100 Î¼A MC enhanced the angiogenic ability of HaCaT cells, which was mediated through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, the current data indicate that 100 Î¼A MC may support wound healing in smoking patients by enhancing angiogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Endometriosis (EM) is one of the vanquished wonted causes of chronic pelvic sting in women and is closely associated with infertility. The long-term, complex, systemic, and post-treatment recurrence of EM wreaks havoc on women's quality of life. Extensive metabolic reprogramming (aerobic glycolysis, glucose overweening intake, and high lactate production) and cancer-like changes have been found in EM, which bears striking similarities to tumorigenesis. The key glycolysis regulator PFKFB4 is overexpressed in EM. However, the mechanism of PFKFB4 in EM remains unknown. We found that PFKFB4 was upregulated and was closely related to the progression of EM. We identified focus PIM2 as a new pioneering adjoin protein of PFKFB4. Vigorous biochemical methods were used to confirm that PIM2 phosphorylated site Thr140 of PFKFB4. PIM2 also could enhance PFKFB4 protein expression through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, PIM2 expression was really corresponding prevalent with PFKFB4 in endometriosis in vivo. Importantly, phosphorylation of PFKFB4 on Thr140 by PIM2 promoted EM glycolysis and cell growth. Our study demonstrates that PIM2 mediates PFKFB4 Thr140 phosphorylation thus regulating glycolysis and EM progression. We illustrated a new mechanism that PIM2 simulated a central upstream partnership in the regulation of PFKFB4, and reveal a novel means of PIM2-PFKFB4 setting EM growth. Our research provided new theoretical support for further clarifying the reprogramming of EM glucose metabolism, and provided new clues for exploring non-contraceptive treatments for EM.",

        "Abstract": "We propose a simple two-step amplifier configuration algorithm based on signal power across different channels to improve the generalized signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) performance of dynamic Câ+âL-band links in the presence of amplifier spontaneous emission (ASE) noise, Kerr nonlinearity, and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) using erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA). In step 1, ASE noise and Kerr nonlinearity are taken into account to derive sub-optimal signal power profiles at the beginning of each span using the local optimization global optimization (LOGO) strategy. The effect of SRS is compensated through amplifier gain pre-tilt in step 2. Simulations for links with homogeneous/heterogeneous spans, static full-channel loading, and dynamic loading due to gradual channel additions for Câ+âL-band upgrades show that the proposed algorithm can achieve similar GSNR performance, but requires much less execution time, compared to other iterative methods that target for improving the GSNR across the Câ+âL band, thus making it a fast and efficient GSNR management strategy for future dynamic Câ+âL-band networks.",

        "Abstract": "This paper aims to apply the time-varying Granger causality test (TVGC) and the DY Spillover Index (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012) to measure the Granger causality and dynamic risk spillover effects of the international crude oil futures market on China's agricultural commodity futures market from the perspectives of return and volatility spillovers. Empirical evidence relating to the TVGC test suggests the existence of unidirectional Granger causality between crude oil futures and agricultural product futures. This relationship shows a strong time-varying property, in particular for sudden or extreme events such as financial crises and natural disasters. On the other hand, the volatility spillover in crude oil and agricultural product futures markets responds asymmetrically and bidirectionally according to the result of the DY Spillover index, and the periodicity of total volatility spillover correlates closely with the occurrence of global economic events, which indicates that the spillover effect between crude oil and agricultural commodity futures markets will be exacerbated in turbulent financial and economic times. Such findings are expected to help in formulating policy recommendations, portfolio design, and risk-management decisions.",

Through mapping adjacent symbols of PAM-4 signals onto the complex domain, the influence of strongest inter-symbol interference (ISI) can be alleviated during the decision process in a decision feedback equalizer (DFE), effectively combating burst-error propagation when signals are noisy. Moreover, signal-adaptive manipulations of DFE parameters in both the time and the amplitude domain are performed by using an ultra-stable timing recovery and level-adaptive decision. Performance evaluations are made on vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) modulated and multimode fiber (MMF) transmitted 100-Gbit/s optical PAM-4 signals. Based on experimental results of the short-reach optical communication, the proposed DFE outperforms the traditional DFE with a 0.5-dB system power budget gain at the 7% overhead (OH) forward error correction (FEC) bit error rate (BER) threshold.",

In this review, the major UC mechanisms in different nanostructures have been introduced, including the Ln-doped UC mechanism and the TTA UC mechanism. The design and fabrication of Ln-doped UC nanostructures and TTA UC-based UC nanostructures for theranostic applications have been reviewed and discussed. In addition, the current progress in the application of UC nanostructures for diagnosis and therapy has been summarized, including tumor-targeted bioimaging and chemotherapy, image-guided diagnosis and phototherapy, NIR-triggered controlled drug releasing and bioimaging.

        "Abstract": "Single molecule fluorescent probes have attracted considerable attention due to their ultimate sensitivity, fast response, low sample consumption, and high signal-to-noise ratio. Nanoparticles with outstanding optical properties make them perfect candidates for probes in the application of single molecule detection. In this review, we focus on various kinds of nanoparticles acting as single molecule fluorescent probes, including quantum dots, upconverting fluorescent nanoparticles, carbon dots, single-wall carbon nanotubes, fluorescent nanodiamonds, polymeric nanoparticles, nanoclusters, and metallic nanoparticles. Optical properties of various nanoparticles and their recent application in single molecule fluorescent probes are explored. How nanoparticles boost the sensitivity of detection is emphasized in combination with different sensing strategies. Future trends of nanoparticles in single molecule detection are also discussed. We hope that this review can provide practical guidance for researchers who work on nanoparticle-based single molecule fluorescent probes.",

In this study, gold nanocluster-encapsulated hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (hPEI-Au NCs) has been explored as the specific and ratiometric DA nanoprobe through hPEI-assisted DA self-polymerization reactions. The Au NCs encapsulation not only provides a fluorescent internal reference but also enhances the DA self-polymerization by weakening the proton sponge effect of the hPEI layer. Rapid and sensitive DA detection is realized through the proposed hPEI-Au NC nanoprobe with a limit of detection of 10Â nM. The favorable selectivity over other possible interferents including amino acids, sugars, and salts is due to the specific self-polymerization reaction. The DA analysis in urine samples with small relative standard deviations has been accomplished with an hPEI-Au NC nanoprobe.",

        "Abstract": "Laparoscopic duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (L-DPPHR) is technically demanding with extreme difficulty in biliary preservation. Only a few reports of L-DPPHR are available with alarming bile leakage, and none of them revealed the long-term metabolic outcomes. For the first time, our study explored the different dosage and timing of indocyanine green (ICG) for guiding L-DPPHR and described the long-term metabolic results.",

        "Abstract": "A total of 8 bHLH transcription factors were cloned from Panax quinquefolius and the response of them to methyl jasmonate(MeJA) was studied.To be specific, based on the preliminary transcriptome screening, 8 bHLH transcription factors were cloned with seedlings which had been cultured for 3 weeks.The content of ginsenosides Rg_1, Re, and Rb_1, and total saponins in the adventitious roots of P.quinquefolius was determined at different time of MeJA treatment by high performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) and spectrophotometry.Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(PCR) was used to detect the relative expression of 8 transcription factors after MeJA treatment.The correlation between the relative expression of the 8 transcription factors and the saponin content after MeJA treatment was checked by Pearson's correlation analysis.The results showed that the PCR products(Pq-bHLH21-Pq-bHLH28) of the 8 bHLH transcription factors were 762-2 013 bp in length.They were submitted to NCBI to obtain the Genbank access numbers.The proteins yielded from Pq-bHLH21-Pq-bHLH28 showed amino acid sequence identity of 24.90%, and each amino acid sequence had the bHLH(Basic Helix-loop-helix) conserved domain and belonged to the bHLH family.The 5 amino acid sequences of Pq-bHLH22 and Pq-bHLH24-Pq-bHLH27 contained the bHLH-MYC N domain, which belonged to the MYC transcription factors.Pq-bHLH21-Pq-bHLH28 responded to MeJA within 48 h of treatment.At 72 h, the expression of Pq-bHLH24 reached 106.53 folds the highest in the treatment group.Pq-bHLH25, Pq-bHLH27, and Pq-bHLH28 showed synergic expression.Pq-bHLH21 may re-gulate the biosynthetic pathway of ginsenoside Rb_1, while Pq-bHLH22, Pq-bHLH25, and Pq-bHLH28 were in significantly positive correlation with the biosynthetic pathway of ginsenoside Re.The result lays a foundation for further verifying the regulation of ginsenoside biosynthesis by bHLH transcription factors.",

        "Abstract": "A nonlinearity-aware signal transmission scheme based on a low-complexity 3rd-order diagonally pruned absolute-term nonlinear equalizer (NLE) with weight sharing (DP-AT-NLE-WS) and rate-adaptable probabilistically shaped 16-level pulse amplitude modulation (PS-PAM-16) signal is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for C-band net-300-Gbit/s/Î» short-reach optical interconnects. By replacing the multiplication operation with the absolute operation and applying weight sharing to reduce the kernel redundancy, the computational complexity of the proposed 3rd-order DP-AT-NLE-WS is reduced by >40% compared with the 3rd-order DP-Volterra NLE (DP-VNLE), DP-AT-NLE, and DP-VNLE-WS, with the achieved normalized general mutual information (NGMI) above a threshold of 0.857. Employing a commercial 32-GHz Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a single digital-to-analog converter (DAC), we demonstrate the single-lane transmission of 100-GBaud PS-PAM-16 signal using DP-AT-NLE-WS in the C band at record 370-Gbit/s line rate and 300.4-Gbit/s net rate over 1-km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF), achieving 21.2% (15.5%) capacity improvement over 100 (105)-GBaud PAM-8 transmission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first net-300-Gbit/s intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) short-reach transmission in the C band using commercially available components.",

        "Title": "Guanidinium-rich lipopeptide functionalized bacteria-absorbing sponge as an effective trap-and-kill system for the elimination of focal bacterial infection.",
        "Abstract": "Focal bacterial infections are often difficult to treat due to the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, high risk of relapse, and severe inflammation at local lesions. To address multidrug-resistant skin and soft tissue infections, a bacteria-absorbing sponge was prepared to involve a \"trap-and-kill\" mechanism. The system describes a guanidinium-rich lipopeptide functionalized lyotropic liquid-crystalline hydrogel with bicontinuous cubic networks. Amphiphilic lipopeptides can be spontaneously anchored to the lipid-water interface, exposing their bacterial targeting sequences to enhance antibacterial trapping/killing activity. Computational simulations supported our structural predictions, and the sponge was confirmed to successfully remove â¼98.8% of the bacteria in the medium. Release and degradation behavior studies indicated that the bacteria-absorbing sponge could degrade, mediate enzyme-responsive lipopeptide release, or generate â¼200 nm lipopeptide nanoparticles with environmental erosion. This implies that the sponge can effectively capture and isolate high concentrations of bacteria at the infected site and then sustainably release antimicrobial lipopeptides into deep tissues for the eradication of residual bacteria. In the animal experiment, we found that the antibacterial performance of the bacterial-absorbing sponge was significant, which demonstrated not only a long-term inhibition effect to disinfect and avoid bacterial rebound, but also a unique advantage to protect tissue from bacterial attack. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Host defense peptides/peptidomimetics (HDPs) have shown potential for the elimination of focal bacterial infections, but the application of their topical formulations suffers from time-consuming preparation processes, indistinctive toxicity reduction effects, and inefficient bacterial capture ability. To explore new avenues for the development of easily prepared, low-toxicity and high-efficiency topical antimicrobials, a guanidinium-rich lipopeptide was encapsulated in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline hydrogel (denoted as \"bacteria-absorbing sponge\") to achieve complementary superiorities. The superior characteristic of the bacteria-absorbing sponge involves a \"trap-and-kill\" mechanism, which undergoes not only a long-term inhibition effect to disinfect and avoid bacterial rebound, but also effective bacterial capture and isolating action to confine bacterial diffusion and protect tissues from bacterial attack.",

        "Abstract": "Idiopathic achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized by the absence of esophageal peristalsis and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). However, the pathogenesis of idiopathic achalasia remains unclear. To further understand the pathogenesis, we conducted lncRNA and mRNA microarray analyses. LES specimens from 5 patients and 4 controls were used for microarray. Potential target genes with significantly changed lncRNA and mRNA were predicted using cis/trans-regulatory algorithms, followed by the Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis to understand the biophysical effect. Finally, 7,133 significantly dysregulated mRNAs (3,136 increased and 3,997 decreased), along with 6,892 significantly dysregulated lncRNAs (4,900 increased and 1,992 decreased). Biophysical function analysis revealed that the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) pathway was a common pathway. The predicted lncRNA targets of NRXN1 (Down FC: 9.07), NTNG2 (UP FC: 2.75), CADM1 (Down FC: 2.26), NLGN1 (Down FC: 4.60), NEGR1 (Down FC: 2.335), CD22 (Down FC: 5.62), HLA-DQB1 (Down FC: 5.06), and HLA-DOA (Down FC: 2.31) were inputted in this pathway, which was mainly located in the synapse part of the neural system and immune system. Our study demonstrates the lncRNAs and corresponding mRNAs that may play important roles in idiopathic achalasia.",

        "Abstract": "The bandwidth limitation of optoelectronic devices is a key constraint for realizing higher capacity short-reach optical communication systems. In this work, we show that the performance of the timing recovery algorithm will significantly impact the performance of bandwidth-limited optical PAM-4 signals. To address this problem, we introduce a moving average filter (MAF) into the Gardner retiming loop to realize ultra-stable retiming without any pilot symbols. It enables a significantly reduced timing jitter, especially for bandwidth-limited conditions. Based on simulations, we show that the proposed retiming scheme will give a stable sampling phase, which is beneficial to the performance of the decision feedback equalizer. Compared to the system based on the traditional Gardner timing synchronization algorithm, the 2-dB power budget gain is realized. The proposed method improves the equalization performance of short-reach optical communication systems where complexity and processing latency are important concerns.",

        "Abstract": "Bladder cancer (BCa) is the most common cancer in the urinary system with high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel subclass of noncoding-RNA which participate in progression of BCa. Here, we identified a novel circRNA-circ3323 and aimed to investigate the role of circ3323 in progression of BCa. Public data of RNA sequencing was used to identify significant circRNA related to BCa. The role of circRNAs in progression of BCa was assessed in cytotoxicity assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry. Biotin-coupled RNA pull-down and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed to evaluate the interaction between circRNAs and miRNAs. The expression of circ3323 was higher in BCa tissues and cells than in normal samples. Experiments in vitro showed that the knockdown of circ3323 inhibited cell proliferation and impeded the metastasis of BCa cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that circ3323 acts as a sponge for miR-186-5p and promotes host gene APP's expression. Clinically, circ3323 predicts worse overall survival of BCa patients, indicating its prognostic value. Our study identified that circ3323 modulates metastasis of BCa through miR-186-5p/APP axis and may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for BCa, which provides novel insights into treatment of BCa.",

        "Abstract": "The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) had a large impact on human health and socio-economics worldwide. The lockdown implemented in China beginning from January 23, 2020 led to sharp reductions in human activities and associated emissions. The declines in primary pollution provided a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between anthropogenic emissions and air quality. This study reports on air pollutant and meteorological measurements at different heights from a tall tower in the Pearl River Delta. These measurements were used to investigate the vertical scale response of pollutants to understand reductions in human activities. Compared to that in the pre-lockdown period (from December 16, 2019), the concentrations of surface layer nitric oxide (NO",

        "Abstract": "The sensitive and selective perception of dopamine (DA, a typical neurotransmitter) is important to evaluate the biological environment. In this study, a catechin-functionalized gold nanocluster (C-Au NC) nanoprobe has been explored for the ratiometric DA sensing. The detection mechanism is based on the formation of azamonardine via selective DA-catechin chemical reaction and subsequent enhanced fluorescence emission. Using Au NC emission as the internal reference, ratiometric fluorescence variation is realized, which allows sensitive DA analysis with a limit of detection of 1.0Â nM (S/NÂ =Â 3) and linear response concentration range from 0 to 500Â nM. The characteristic chemical reaction between catechin and DA affords favorable selectivity over other amino acids, metal ions and small molecules. In addition, the practical application of the proposed nanoprobe is validated by the accurate detection of DA content in urea and cell lysate samples.",

        "Abstract": "To address the problem of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ultrasonic echo generated by laser-electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) ultrasonic method in metal materials, a method to improve the energy conversion efficiency of laser-EMAT ultrasonic testing using the surface constraint mechanism is proposed. Based on numerical simulation and experiment, the excitation mechanism of a laser surface heat source with and without a surface constraint mechanism is investigated, and the effect of the water film surface constraint on the laser-EMAT ultrasonic testing echo of different metal materials is analyzed. The effects of laser spot radius, laser power density, laser pulse duration, EMAT design parameters, and water film parameters on the ultrasonic echo amplitude and multimode ultrasonic energy distribution ratio are also investigated, and the optimal combination of laser excitation and EMAT reception parameters is provided. The results show that the laser power density and spot radius significantly affect the multimode ultrasonic amplitudes. Under the water film surface constraint, the energy distributions of shear waves (SWs) and longitudinal waves (LWs) change significantly, and the energy of the SW change rules of different metal materials are different. After using the surface constraint mechanism, the LW amplitude improves significantly, and the SNR of the LW is increased by at least 13.0Â dB, the main bang duration is reduced by at least 29.4%, and the main bang amplitude is reduced by more than 80.5%. The relevant information of the surface constraint mechanism provides an effective reference for designing the laser-EMAT testing system with LW detections and reducing the dead zone in ultrasonic testing.",

        "Abstract": "MYC as a transcriptional factor plays a crucial role in breast cancer progression. However, the mechanisms underlying MYC deubiquitination in breast cancer are not well defined. Here, we report that OTUB1 is responsible for MYC deubiquitination. OTUB1 could directly deubiquitinate MYC at K323 site, which blocks MYC protein degradation. Moreover, OTUB1 mediated MYC protein stability is also confirmed in OTUB1-knockout mice. Stabilized MYC by OTUB1 promotes its transcriptional activity and induces HK2 expression, which leads to enhance aerobic glycolysis. Therefore, OTUB1 promotes breast tumorigenesis in vivo and in vitro via blocking MYC protein degradation. Taken together, our data identify OTUB1 as a new deubiquitination enzyme for MYC protein degradation, which provides a potential target for breast cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "It has been proposed for years that physical exercise ameliorates metabolic diseases. Optimal exercise timing in humans and mammals has indicated that circadian clocks play a vital role in exercise and body metabolism. Skeletal muscle metabolism exhibits a robust circadian rhythm under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Clock genes also control the development, differentiation, and function of skeletal muscles. In this review, we aimed to clarify the relationship between exercise, skeletal muscles, and the circadian clock. Health benefits can be attained by the scheduling of exercise at the best circadian time. Exercise therapy for metabolic diseases and cardiovascular health is a key adjuvant method. This review highlights the importance of exercise timing in maintaining healthy metabolism and circadian clocks.",

        "Abstract": "We propose the asynchronous control of anisotropic diffusion (AD) algorithm, and such asynchronous anisotropic diffusion (AAD) algorithm is demonstrated experimentally to reduce noise from the sensing signals obtained from Brillouin distributed optical fiber sensors. The performance of the proposed AAD algorithm is analyzed in detail for different experimental conditions and compared with that of block-matching and 3D filtering, two-dimensional wavelet denoising, AD, and non-local means algorithms. Some key factors of the proposed algorithm, such as the impact of convolution kernel size on the performance of AD algorithms, the influence of low sampling point number (SPN) on the quality of Brillouin frequency shift and the selection of diffusion thresholds are analyzed and discussed with experimental results. The experimental results validate that the AAD algorithm can provide better root-mean-square error (RMSE) and spatial resolution (SR) than the other four algorithms, especially for higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement and higher SPNs. For lower SPNs, the performance of AAD is also not inferior to the RMSE performance of NLM and AD. The runtime of the AAD algorithm is also quite low. Moreover, the proposed algorithm offers the best SR performance as compared to other noise reduction algorithms investigated in this study. Thus, the proposed AAD algorithm can be an effective candidate to improve the measurement accuracy of Brillouin distributed optical fiber sensors.",

        "Abstract": "Temperature distribution in concrete is significant to the concrete structure's macro properties and different factors affect the heat transfer in concrete, and therefore influence the temperature distribution. This work established a three-dimensional transient heat transfer model coupled with various environmental factors, using the finite element method for calculating the results and real-measured data for testing accuracy. In addition, a sensitivity evaluation of various factors was conducted. Due to various environmental factors, the results revealed that the prediction of temperature distribution in concrete by the three-dimensional model had great accuracy with an error of less than 4%. A particular hysteresis effect of temperature response in the concrete existed. Considering heat transfer in different spatial directions, the model can predict the temperature change of each spatial point instead of the spatial surface in different depths, proving the shortcomings of a one-dimensional heat transfer model. A greater solar radiation intensity caused a more significant temperature difference on the concrete surface: the surface temperature difference in July was twice as significant as that in December. Wind speed had a cooling effect on the concrete surface, and stronger wind speed accompanied with a stronger cooling effect made the surface temperature closer to the ambient temperature. Material properties had different effects on the temperature distribution of the surface part and internal part: the specific heat capacity determined the speed of the outer layer temperature change while the thermal conductivity determined the speed of the inner layer temperature change.",

        "Abstract": "To increase the transmission capacity, ultra-wideband wavelength-division multiplexing (UWB WDM) has been exploited to enlarge the spectral range. However, inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) results in power transition from high-frequency channels to low-frequency channels in wideband scenarios, which degrades the Q-factor of signals. Hence, we modify the optimization method of power control by applying the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to search for the optimal power slopes and offsets of three bands to construct an optimum distribution of launch powers over channels. High transmission capacity can be reached by carrying 384 channels (96+96+192) in the C+L+S band with the consideration of dynamic Raman gain and channel-dependent parameters. We show that compared to using brute-force searching (BFS), a comparable and even higher transmission capacity can be achieved by the SA algorithm. Meanwhile, the searching speed of the SA algorithm is much faster. Also, different optimizing strategies can be selected to balance the trade-off between capacity and spectral flatness. This method can be used for designing arbitrary optical fiber UWB WDM systems before practical testing.",

Based on the simulation, a fiber, with a thicker ring core and a relatively low refractive index contrast at the ring-core boundaries, is found of higher mode purity and lower macro-bending-caused mode coupling.

        "Abstract": "Gadopentetate meglumine (Gd-DTPA) is a commonly used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhancer in the clinic for improving the clarity of MRI. Reports have shown that severe anaphylactoid reactions can occur after intravenous injections, whereas the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. In this study, the effects of Gd-DTPA in causing allergic like reactions and mast cells (MCs) activation were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Gd-DTPA induced a severe hand paw swelling and body temperature decrease in murine topical cutaneous allergy model, and murine systemic allergy model. Meanwhile, serum IgE was not significantly changed. Histamine, tryptase, and cytokines release in mice serum and LAD2 cells supernatant were increased significantly both in mice serum and LAD2 supernatant after treated with Gd-DTPA. Subsequently, the changes in mRNA levels after Gd-DTPA activated MCs were analyzed by RNAseq and found to be related to inflammation signaling pathways. The study provides a demonstration for the adverse reaction mechanism of Gd-DTPA and its safe use in clinic.",

        "Abstract": "Generally, the high efficiency of solution-processable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) comes at the expense of using expensive organic matters as a hole-transport material (HTM). Although intense efforts have tried to use commercially available and low-cost macrocyclic molecules as HTM candidates, they still face two enormous challenges: poor solubility and inherent instability. Here, solvothermal treatment for old and insoluble HTMs (phthalocyanine (Pc) and its derivatives) has been proposed, which is unusual due to the occurrence of solubilization for insoluble precursors induced by the carbonization of the dissolved part. Since the macrocyclic structure still exists, the as-prepared new-type carbon dots not only retain the capacity of hole transfer but serve as an effective passivation additive. Synergy makes the all-air-processed carbon-based PSCs (CH",

        "Title": "Automatic Sparse Connectivity Learning for Neural Networks.",
        "Abstract": "Since sparse neural networks usually contain many zero weights, these unnecessary network connections can potentially be eliminated without degrading network performance. Therefore, well-designed sparse neural networks have the potential to significantly reduce the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and computational resources. In this work, we propose a new automatic pruning method-sparse connectivity learning (SCL). Specifically, a weight is reparameterized as an elementwise multiplication of a trainable weight variable and a binary mask. Thus, network connectivity is fully described by the binary mask, which is modulated by a unit step function. We theoretically prove the fundamental principle of using a straight-through estimator (STE) for network pruning. This principle is that the proxy gradients of STE should be positive, ensuring that mask variables converge at their minima. After finding Leaky ReLU, Softplus, and identity STEs can satisfy this principle, we propose to adopt identity STE in SCL for discrete mask relaxation. We find that mask gradients of different features are very unbalanced; hence, we propose to normalize mask gradients of each feature to optimize mask variable training. In order to automatically train sparse masks, we include the total number of network connections as a regularization term in our objective function. As SCL does not require pruning criteria or hyperparameters defined by designers for network layers, the network is explored in a larger hypothesis space to achieve optimized sparse connectivity for the best performance. SCL overcomes the limitations of existing automatic pruning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that SCL can automatically learn and select important network connections for various baseline network structures. Deep learning models trained by SCL outperform the state-of-the-art human-designed and automatic pruning methods in sparsity, accuracy, and FLOPs reduction.",

First, the relevant theories of positive psychology are introduced and expounded, and the importance of the education of college students' outlook on life is analyzed. Second, the current situations of college students' outlook on life and the education of their outlook on life are investigated through a questionnaire survey, and the problems presented in the questionnaire are analyzed. Then, the correlation between positive psychology and the education of college students' outlook on life is explored, and their mutual connection is analyzed. The results are as follows: 77.4% of the college students have periodical aims and work hard for them; 80.8% of the students think that the realization of life goals rely on hard work, accounting for the largest proportion; when they encounter setbacks, more than 80% of the students choose to work hard to overcome them; 69.2% students think that their outlook on life comes from self-learning and exploration. According to college students' outlook on life in China and other countries, there are many problems in the education of college students' outlook on life, and the teaching quality of the education of college students' outlook on life is backward. The combination of positive psychology and college students' education of college students' outlook on life under the theory of educational psychology provides new ideas and ways for college students' education of college students' outlook on life. The conclusion of this study promotes the innovation of the education of college students' outlook on life.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease associated with pain and disability. OA patients are at a high risk for venous thrombosis (VTE). Here, we developed an interpretable machine learning (ML)-based model to predict VTE risk in patients with OA. To establish a prediction model, we used six ML algorithms, of which 35 variables were employed. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to screen the most related clinical variables associated with VTE. SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to interpret the ML mode and determine the importance of the selected features. Overall, 3169 patients with OA (average age: 66.52 Â± 7.28 years) were recruited from Xi'an Honghui Hospital. Of these, 352 and 2817 patients were diagnosed with and without VTE, respectively. The XGBoost algorithm showed the best performance. According to the RFE algorithms, 15 variables were retained for further modeling with the XGBoost algorithm. The top three predictors were Kellgren-Lawrence grade, age, and hypertension. Our study showed that the XGBoost model with 15 variables has a high potential to predict VTE risk in patients with OA.",

        "Abstract": "Adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen are crucial parameters for catalyst characterization and catalytic oxidation mechanism. Therefore, rapid discrimination of adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen is highly desired. Herein, a direct correlation between cataluminescence (CTL) kinetic curve and oxygen species was discovered. The adsorbed oxygen-catalyzed CTL only lasted for a few minutes, whereas the lattice oxygen-catalyzed CTL could exhibit hours of continuous luminescence. The long-term CTL was attributed to the slow migration of lattice oxygen in a slow and continuous catalytic oxidation reaction. In addition to the discrimination between the adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen by the CTL kinetic processes, the corresponding CTL intensity was positively proportional to their amounts. Accordingly, the developed catalytic oxidation-related CTL can be used as an indicator for rapid discrimination and determination of adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen in catalysts. Oxygen species detected by the proposed CTL method not only matched well with those obtained by conventional X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and O",

        "Abstract": "Accurately predicting driving behavior can help to avoid potential improper maneuvers of human drivers, thus guaranteeing safe driving for intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel deep belief network (DBN), called MSR-DBN, by integrating a multi-target sigmoid regression (MSR) layer with DBN to predict the front wheel angle and speed of the ego vehicle. Precisely, the MSR-DBN consists of two sub-networks: one is for the front wheel angle, and the other one is for speed. This MSR-DBN model allows ones to optimize lateral and longitudinal behavior predictions through a systematic testing method. In addition, we consider the historical states of the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles and the driver's operations as inputs to predict driving behaviors in a real-world environment. Comparison of the prediction results of MSR-DBN with a general DBN model, back propagation (BP) neural network, support vector regression (SVR), and radical basis function (RBF) neural network, demonstrates that the proposed MSR-DBN outperforms the others in terms of accuracy and robustness.",

We established a setup that can transmit an EF and maintain a stable cell culture environment. An EF was applied to HaCaT cells, and scratch-assays were performed as a model of wound healing to observe cell migration. Proliferation was evaluated by mitochondrial activity, total protein, and DNA content. Secretion of healing-associated cytokines was evaluated via cytokine arrays, and Western blot was applied to investigate signaling pathway alterations.

        "Abstract": "Intracellular pH homeostasis is essential for the survival and function of biological cells. Negatively charged molecular probes, such as pyranine (HPTS), tend to exhibit poor salt tolerance and unsatisfactory cell permeability, limiting their widespread use in intracellular assays. Herein, we explored a charge neutralization strategy using multicharged cationic nanocarriers for an efficient and stable assembly with the pH-sensitive HPTS. Through immobilization and neutralization with poly(allylamine hydrochloride)-stabilized red-emitting gold nanoclusters (PAH-AuNCs), the resulting nanoprobes (HPTS-PAH-AuNCs) offered improved salt tolerance, satisfactory cell permeability, and dual-emission properties. The fluorescence ratio exhibited a linear response over the pH range of 3.0-9.0. Moreover, the proposed HPTS-PAH-AuNCs were successfully applied to determine and visualize lysosomal pH variations in living cells, which indicated great potential for biosensing and bioimaging applications in living systems. Benefiting from the charge neutralization strategy, various types of probes can be expected to achieve broader analytical applications.",

Many achievements on this material have been made in photocatalysis, but the advantages have not yet been fully explored in electrochemical fields. The bulk structure with low conductivity impedes charge-transfer kinetics during electrochemical processes. Excessive nitrogen content leads to insufficient charge transfer, while bulk structures produce tortuous channels for mass transport. Some attempts have been made to address these issues by nanostructure engineering, such as ultrathin structure design, heterogeneous composition, defect engineering, and morphology control. These structure-engineered nanomaterials have been successfully applied in electrochemical fields, including ionic actuators, flexible supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and electrochemical sensors. Herein, a timely review on the latest advances in graphitic carbon nitride through various engineering strategies for electrochemical applications has been summarized. A perspective on critical challenges and future research directions is highlighted for graphitic carbon nitride in electrochemistry on the basis of existing research works and our experimental experience.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by the gradual loss of renal function and is a major public health concern. Risk factors for CKD include hypertension and proteinuria, both of which are associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ER stress-induced TDAG51 protein expression is increased at an early time point in mice with CKD. Based on these findings, wild-type and TDAG51 knock-out (TDKO) mice were used in an angiotensin II/deoxycorticosterone acetate/salt model of CKD. Both wild-type and TDKO mice developed hypertension, increased proteinuria and albuminuria, glomerular injury, and tubular damage. However, TDKO mice were protected from apoptosis and renal interstitial fibrosis. Human proximal tubular cells were used to demonstrate that TDAG51 expression induces apoptosis through a CHOP-dependent mechanism. Further, a mouse model of intrinsic acute kidney injury demonstrated that CHOP is required for ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Renal fibroblasts were used to demonstrate that TGF-Î² induces collagen production through an IRE1-dependent mechanism; cells treated with a TGF-Î² receptor 1 inhibitor prevented XBP1 splicing, a downstream consequence of IRE1 activation. Interestingly, TDKO mice express significantly less TGF-Î² receptor 1, thus, preventing TGF-Î²-mediated XBP1 splicing. In conclusion, TDAG51 induces apoptosis in the kidney through a CHOP-dependent mechanism, while contributing to renal interstitial fibrosis through a TGF-Î²-IRE1-XBP1 pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Thymoma is the most common primary mass in anterior mediastinum. Although associated with low malignancy, it is often accompanied by myasthenia gravis resulting in poor prognosis. Due to the dual factors of tumor immune tolerance and autoimmune reaction, it is urgent to understand the immune status of MG with thymoma. In this study, RNA sequencing data were obtained from the TCGA and GEO cohorts to identify differentially expressed messenger RNAs and infiltrated immune cells. A total of 121 samples in TCGA and 43 samples in GEO were screened out. The infiltrated immune cells were identified by CIBERSORT, in which Tfh cells and activated DC cells were abnormal in thymoma patients. The differently expressed genes were performed by package LIMMA. The functional characteristics of differently expression genes were analyzed by GO and KEGG; one GO and seven KEGG pathways were both found in both TCGA and GEO cohorts. Meanwhile, 27 common differently expressed genes were obtained and were displayed by a Venn diagram. The TRRUST was used to screen the hub genes for the common 27 different genes and 6 genes were found. Then, PPI networks were constructed. Subsequently, the relationship between SCNAs of common genes and related immune cells tested by TIMER. Kaplan-Meier plots, ROC curve and Cox's expression model for immune infiltration and hub genes were also tested. In conclusion, we found that two types of immune infiltrated cells and six hub genes can predict the occurrence of myasthenia gravis in thymoma patients.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, an all-fiber sensor based on hollow core Bragg fiber (HCBF) is proposed and successfully manufactured, which can be used for human breath monitoring. Benefiting from the identical outer diameters of HCBF and single mode fibers (SMFs), the sensor can be directly constructed by sandwiching a segment of HCBF between two SMFs. Based on optical propagation properties of HCBF, the transmission light is sensitive to specific environmental change induced by human breath. Thus, the breath signals can be explicitly recorded by measuring the intensity of the transmitted laser. The sensor presents a rapid response time of â¼0.15 s and recovery time of â¼0.65 s. In addition, the HCBF-based sensor shows good insensitivity to the variation of temperature and curvature, which enables its reliable sensing performance in the dynamic and changeful environment.",

        "Abstract": "To combat chromatic dispersion (CD) in intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) systems, three chirp-free demonstrations are experimentally performed with an iterative pre-electronic dispersion compensation (pre-EDC) algorithm at the transmitter end, for 28 GBaud non-return-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK), 56 GBaud NRZ-OOK and 28 GBaud four-level pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM-4) signals, over distances of 100 km, 50 km and 40 km of single mode fiber (SMF), respectively. The iterative pre-EDC algorithm is based on the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, which treats the unconstrained phase at the direct detection receiver as a degree of freedom. At the receiver side, only a linear fractionally-spaced (T/2) post-feed-forward equalizer (post-FFE) is employed to combat the residual inter-symbol interference (ISI). Experimental results show that the aforementioned three demonstrations can approach the forward error correction (FEC) bit error rate (BER) threshold of 3.8âÃâ10",

        "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder has become an increasingly serious disease in the world. However, convenient antidepressants have low efficacy and slow onset defects, which is dangerous for suicidal tendency patients. Nowadays, rapid antidepressant research has become the focus. Merazin hydrate (MH), a component of the natural herb Fructus Aurantii, has been shown to produce rapid antidepressant-like effects in animal models. However, the mechanism of its rapid antidepressant-like effects was still elusive like that of ketamine. The study aimed to reveal the relationship between the rapid antidepressant-like effects of MH and mTOR signaling, which is closely related to rapid antidepressants. The results showed that a single administration of MH was capable of reversing the behavioral defects at 2 h in two classic depressive models including learned helplessness (LH) and chronic mild stress (CMS). Moreover, the phosphorylated expression of mTOR, reduced by LH or CMS, was upregulated after a single administration of MH, and the expressions of BDNF and synaptic proteins in the hippocampus were also reversed 2 h later, similar to ketamine. Moreover, LH increased the expressions of eNOS, IL-10, and TNF-Î± in serum, which were all reversed by a single dose of MH at 2 h, similar to ketamine. Furthermore, we used rapamycin, an antagonist of mTOR, to confirm whether the rapid antidepressant-like effects of MH depend on mTOR or not. We found that inhibiting the activation of mTOR blocked the rapid antidepressant-like effects of MH, which also inhibited the upregulation of expressions of BDNF and PSD95. To sum up, the rapid antidepressant effect of MH depended on the activation of mTOR to regulate downstream BNDF and synaptic protein expressions.",

        "Abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) diseases are the leading causes of death and disabilities in the world. It is quite challenging to treat CNS diseases efficiently because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). It is a physical barrier with tight junction proteins and high selectivity to limit the substance transportation between the blood and neural tissues. Thus, it is important to understand BBB transport mechanisms for developing novel drug carriers to overcome the BBB. This paper introduces the structure of the BBB and its physiological transport mechanisms. Meanwhile, different strategies for crossing the BBB by using nanomaterial-based drug carriers are reviewed, including carrier-mediated, adsorptive-mediated, and receptor-mediated transcytosis. Since the viral-induced CNS diseases are associated with BBB breakdown, various neurotropic viruses and their mechanisms on BBB disruption are reviewed and discussed, which are considered as an alternative solution to overcome the BBB. Therefore, most recent studies on virus-mimicking nanocarriers for drug delivery to cross the BBB are also reviewed and discussed. On the other hand, the routes of administration of drug-loaded nanocarriers to the CNS have been reviewed. In sum, this paper reviews and discusses various strategies and routes of nano-formulated drug delivery systems across the BBB to the brain, which will contribute to the advanced diagnosis and treatment of CNS diseases.",

        "Abstract": "This study offers an efficient hardness identification approach to address the problem of poor real-time performance and accuracy in coal and rock hardness detection. To begin, Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) was performed on the current signal of the cutting motor to obtain a number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Further, the target signal was selected among the IMFs to reconstruct the current signal according to the energy density and correlation coefficient criteria. After that, the Multi-scale Permutation Entropy (MPE) of the reconstructed signal was trained by the Adaboost improved Back Propagation (BP) neural network, in order to establish the hardness recognition model. Finally, the cutting arm's swing speed and the cutting head's rotation speed were adjusted based on the coal and rock hardness. The simulation results indicated that using the energy density and correlation criterion to reconstruct the signal can successfully filter out noise interference. Compared to the BP model, the relative root-mean-square error of the Adaboost-BP model decreased by 0.0633, and the prediction results were more accurate. Additionally, the speed control strategy based on coal and rock hardness can ensure the efficient cutting of the roadheader.",

        "Abstract": "The abundant and heterogeneous distribution of toxic phenol from plastics has drawn worldwide attention. However, the common analysis methods failed to identify the accurate species of these phenolic hazards from plastics in a direct and nondestructive approach. Herein, we demonstrate the layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as a novel matrix in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) for low-molecular-weight phenols leaked from plastics. LDHs own abundant hydroxyl groups to facilitate chemoselectivity and ionization of phenols through the formation of hydrogen bonds with these phenols. More importantly, the LDH matrix could provide a distinguishable signal for the homolog and isomeride of these phenolic hazards. The developed method could realize nondestructive and in situ mapping of phenolic hazards in plastics. Our success could help to track the low-molecular-weight compounds liberated from plastics and supply spatial information for polluted plastics. We anticipated that the proposed approach could provide sufficient information to evaluate and alarm the safety of food packaging plastics.",

End-to-end conditional distribution tracking enables an adaptive decoding of optical IMDD signals, with robustness to the bias point shift of the optical intensity modulator. Experimental demonstration is conducted over a 20-Gbits/s optical pulse amplitude modulation-4 (PAM-4) modulation system. Optical PAM-4 signals are optically down-sampled by short pulses to 250 Msa/s. Then, statistical characters of signal distribution can be estimated using inline GMM processing. Due to the real-time learned distribution, intelligent decoding of received signals exhibits a perfect adaptation to the changing bias point of a Mach-Zendner intensity modulator, enhancing the communication reliability with bit error rate (BER) below 3.8â10",

        "Abstract": "The F-box and WD-repeat-containing protein 2 (FBXW2) plays a crucial role as an E3 ligase in regulating tumorigenesis. However, the functions of FBXW2 in breast cancer are still unknown. Here, we find that nuclear factor-kB (NF-ÎºB) p65 is a new substrate of FBXW2. FBXW2 directly binds to p65, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. Interestingly, p300 acetylation of p65 blocks FBXW2 induced p65 ubiquitination. FBXW2-p65 axis is a crucial regulator of SOX2-induced stemness in breast cancer. Moreover, FBXW2 inhibits breast tumor growth by regulating p65 degradation in vitro and in vivo. FBXW2 overexpression abrogates the effects of p65 on paclitaxel resistance in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, FBXW2 induced p65 degradation is also confirmed in FBXW2-knockout mice. Our results identify FBXW2 as an important E3 ligase for p65 degradation, which provide insights into the tumor suppressor functions of FBXW2 in breast cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Glucocorticoid (GC; dexamethasone, DEX) -induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (GIOFH) is a challenging orthopedic disease, and its underlying mechanism remains not clear. This study exposed murine long bone osteocyte-Y4 (MLO-Y4) cells to DEX below normoxic or hypoxic circumstances and found that cell autophagy have been reduced. At the same time, flow cytometry analysis showed increased apoptosis, which was more pronounced in hypoxic environments. Recent research also claimed that GC induces osteoporosis after osteocyte apoptosis, and subsequent microfractures lead to ischemia and hypoxia of the femoral head, resulted in GIOFH. Presently, we found that both mitophagy-related protein hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±) and BNIP3 were up-regulated in the hypoxic environment, and their expression was down-regulated when exposed to DEX. Besides, we demonstrated that overexpressing HIF-1Î± resisted DEX-induced apoptosis in a hypoxic environment. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of HIF-1Î±, through its downstream marker BNIP3, reduced the suppression of DEX on mitophagy induced by hypoxia and protected bone cells from apoptosis. Also, these findings may provide a direction of the promising application for better GIOFH treatment shortly.",

But their practical applications are restricted by low sensitivity and limited cycling stability, which result from piezoionic mechanism with insufficient sensing response. Here, we report a highly sensitive ultrastable sensor based on proton-coupled electron transfer, which is different from piezoionic mechanism. The sensor gives a high sensing signal output of 117 mV, which is 16 times higher than that of counterpart device (7 mV). It delivers excellent working stability with performance retention as high as 99.13% over 10â¯000 bending cycles in air, exceeding that of the best-known sensors reported previously. The flexible sensor displays high sensitivity in detecting real-time signals of human activities with large and subtle deformations, including wrist bending, moving speed, pulse wave and voice vibration. Smart functions, such as braille language and handwriting recognitions, are demonstrated for artificial intelligence.",

        "Abstract": "We report on the development and validation of the OPLS4 force field. OPLS4 builds upon our previous work with OPLS3e to improve model accuracy on challenging regimes of drug-like chemical space that includes molecular ions and sulfur-containing moieties. A novel parametrization strategy for charged species, which can be extended to other systems, is introduced. OPLS4 leads to improved accuracy on benchmarks that assess small-molecule solvation and protein-ligand binding.",

        "Abstract": "Epilepsy is a complex brain disorder characterized by repetitive seizure events. Epilepsy patients often suffer from various and severe physical and psychological comorbidities (e.g., anxiety, migraine, and stroke). While general comorbidity prevalences and incidences can be estimated from epidemiological data, such an approach does not take into account that actual patient-specific risks can depend on various individual factors, including medication. This motivates to develop a machine learning approach for predicting risks of future comorbidities for individual epilepsy patients. In this work, we use inpatient and outpatient administrative health claims data of around 19,500 U.S. epilepsy patients. We suggest a dedicated multimodal neural network architecture (Deep personalized LOngitudinal convolutional RIsk model-DeepLORI) to predict the time-dependent risk of six common comorbidities of epilepsy patients. We demonstrate superior performance of DeepLORI in a comparison with several existing methods. Moreover, we show that DeepLORI-based predictions can be interpreted on the level of individual patients. Using a game theoretic approach, we identify relevant features in DeepLORI models and demonstrate that model predictions are explainable in light of existing knowledge about the disease. Finally, we validate the model on independent data from around 97,000 patients, showing good generalization and stable prediction performance over time.",

        "Abstract": "We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel interference fading suppression method for phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry (Ï-OTDR) using space-division multiplexed (SDM) pulse probes in a few-mode fiber. The SDM probes consist of multiple different modes, and three spatial modes (LP01, LP11a, and LP11b) are used in this work for the proof of concept. Firstly, the Rayleigh backscattering light of different modes is experimentally characterized, and it turns out that the waveforms of the Ï-OTDR traces for distinct modes are all different and independent. Thanks to the spatial difference of the fading positions for distinct modes, multiple probes from spatially multiplexed modes can be used to suppress the interference fading in Ï-OTDR. Then, the performances of the Ï-OTDR systems using a single probe and multiple probes are evaluated and compared. Specifically, the statistical analysis shows that the fading probabilities over both the fiber length and the time scale are reduced significantly by using multiple SDM probes, which verifies the significant performance improvement on fading suppression. By introducing the concept of SDM to Ï-OTDR, the proposed novel interference fading suppression method avoids the complicated frequency or phase modulation, which has the advantages of simplicity, good effectiveness and high reliability.",

Donor phosphorescent molecules emits light when encapsulated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) through hydrogen bond interactions, and acceptor fluorescent molecules emits light when doped into PVA through cation-Ï interactions and hydrogen bond interactions. In addition, the triplet to singlet energy transfer process and mechanism are proved using the energy diagram and lifetime. The broadband emission color of the obtained composite film can be easily modulated by simply adjusting the amount and component of dyes, especially the white emission with CIE coordinates of (0.339, 0.337). This work provides a facile and versatile method for the development of multicolor and pure white-light-emitting diodes, which uses the interactions to light up luminescence properties, and can further aid in the wide development of applications for TET in various other fields.",

        "Abstract": "The living supramolecular polymerization technique provides an exciting research avenue. However, in comparison with the thermodynamic spontaneous nucleation, using simple monomers to realize living supramolecular polymerization is hardly possible from an energy principle. This is because the activation barrier of kinetically trapped simple monomer (nucleation step) is insufficiently high to control the kinetics of subsequent elongation. Here, with the benefit of the confinement from the layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanomaterial, various simple monomers, (such as benzene, naphthalene and pyrene derivatives) successfully form living supramolecular polymer (LSP) with length control and narrow dispersity. The degree of polymerization can reach ~6000. Kinetics studies reveal LDH overcomes a huge energy barrier to inhibit undesired spontaneous nucleation of monomers and disassembly of metastable states. The universality of this strategy will usher exploration into other multifunctional molecules and promote the development of functional LSP.",

        "Abstract": "Singular value decomposition (SVD) is one of the most effective algorithms in recommender systems (RSs). Due to the iterative nature of SVD algorithms, one big challenge is initialization that has a major impact on the convergence and performance of RSs. Unfortunately, existing SVD algorithms in the literature typically initialize the user and item features in a random manner; thus, data information is not fully utilized. This work addresses the challenge of developing an efficient initialization method for SVD algorithms. We propose a general neural embedding initialization framework, where a low-complexity probabilistic autoencoder neural network initializes the features of user and item. This framework supports explicit and implicit feedback data sets. The design details of our proposed framework are elaborated and discussed. Experimental results show that RSs based on our proposed initialization framework outperform the state-of-the-art methods in rating prediction. Moreover, regarding item ranking, our proposed framework shows an improvement of at least 2.20% ~5.74% than existing SVD algorithms and other matrix factorization methods in the literature.",

        "Abstract": "Methylation of cytosine in CpG dinucleotides and histone lysine and arginine residues is a chromatin modification that critically contributes to the regulation of genome integrity, replication, and accessibility. A strong correlation exists between the genome-wide distribution of DNA and histone methylation, suggesting an intimate relationship between these epigenetic marks. Indeed, accumulating literature reveals complex mechanisms underlying the molecular crosstalk between DNA and histone methylation. These in vitro and in vivo discoveries are further supported by the finding that genes encoding DNA- and histone-modifying enzymes are often mutated in overlapping human diseases. Here, we summarize recent advances in understanding how DNA and histone methylation cooperate to maintain the cellular epigenomic landscape. We will also discuss the potential implication of these insights for understanding the etiology of, and developing biomarkers and therapies for, human congenital disorders and cancers that are driven by chromatin abnormalities.",

        "Abstract": "Since its birth in 1967, the utilization of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) has made substantial progress in a variety of fields for its unique features. However, the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor-acceptor distance has not yet been determined owing to the difficulty in designing the variable lengths between chemiluminescent donors and acceptors. Herein, we synthesized three kinds of tetraphenylethene (TPE)-anchored cationic surfactants with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. For the first time, it is quantitatively demonstrated that the CRET efficiency is inversely proportional to the sixth power of distance between luminol donors and TPE acceptors. The details disclosed in this contribute have provided the solid evidence that CRET follows FÃ¶rster resonance theory. Our strategy would build a promising platform to control donor-acceptor distance, allowing to the interdisciplinary applications of CRET.",

        "Abstract": "Distributed acoustic sensors (DASs) have the capability of registering faint vibrations with high spatial resolution along the sensing fiber. Advanced algorithms are important for DAS in many applications since they can help extract and classify the unique signatures of different types of vibration events. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have powerful spectro-temporal feature learning capability, are well suited for event classification in DAS. Generally, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on the availability of large quantities of training data for learning a mapping from input to output. In this work, to fully utilize the collected information and maximize the power of CNNs, we propose a method to enlarge the useful dataset for CNNs from two aspects. First, we propose an intensity and phase stacked CNN (IP-CNN) to utilize both the intensity and phase information from a DAS with coherent detection. Second, we propose to use data augmentation to further increase the training dataset size. The influence of different data augmentation methods on the performance of the proposed CNN architecture is thoroughly investigated. The experimental results show that the proposed IP-CNN with data augmentation produces a classification accuracy of 88.2% on our DAS dataset with 1km sensing length. This indicates that the usage of both intensity and phase information together with the enlarged training dataset after data augmentation can greatly improve the classification accuracy, which is useful for DAS pattern recognition in real applications.",

        "Abstract": "Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SIONFH) has been a common disease following corticosteroid therapy. Presently, we aim to explore the functions of circular RNA (circ) PVT1 in SIONFH rats and the underlying mechanism. Glucocorticoid (GC) was used to treat SD rats and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to construct SIONFH model in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The pathological injury of the femoral head in the SIONFH rats was detected via haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The osteogenic differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of BMSCs were detected. Western blot was used to detect Smad7, Bax, Bcl2 and Smad2/3. The potential targets of circPVT1 and miR-21-5p were validated through luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA pull-down assay, respectively. We found that CircPVT1 was decreased in the femoral head of SIONFH rats and GC-treated BMSCs, while miR-21-5p was markedly up-regulated. Overexpressed circPVT1 attenuated the apoptosis and cell viability inhibition of BMSCs induced by GC, while miR-21-5p up-regulation had the opposite effects. What's more, the in vivo experiments confirmed that up-regulating circPVT1 repressed osteonecrosis in SIONFH rats through repressing apoptosis. Mechanistically, circPVT1 functioned as a ceRNA of miR-21-5p, which targeted at the 3'untranslated region of Smad7. CircPVT1 enhancing Smad7 and mitigating GC activated TGFÎ²/Smad2/3 pathway through inhibiting miR-21-5p. In conclusion, CircPVT1 exerts protective effects against SIONFH via modulating miR-21-5p-mediated Smad7/TGFÎ² pathway.",
