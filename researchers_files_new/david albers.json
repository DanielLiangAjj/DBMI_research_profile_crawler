        "Abstract": "The protocols and therapeutic guidance established for treating traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in neurointensive care focus on managing cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain tissue oxygenation based on pressure signals. The decision support process relies on assumed relationships between cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and blood flow, pressure-flow relationships (PFRs), and shares this framework of assumptions with mathematical intracranial hemodynamic models. These foundational assumptions are difficult to verify, and their violation can impact clinical decision-making and model validity.",

        "Abstract": "Refined management of mechanically ventilation is an obvious target for improving patient outcomes, but is impeded by the nature of data for study and hypothesis generation. The connections between clinical outcomes and temporal development of iatrogenic injuries current lung-protective ventilator settings remain poorly understood. Analysis of lung-ventilator system (LVS) evolution at relevant timescales is frustrated by data volume and multiple sources of heterogeneity. This work motivates, presents, and validates a computational pipeline for resolving LVS systems into the joint evolution of data-conditioned model parameters and ventilator information. Applied to individuals, the workflow yields a concise low-dimensional representation of LVS behavior expressed in phenotypic breath waveforms suitable for analysis. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through application to multi-day observational series of 35 patients. Individual patient analyses reveal multiple types of patient-oriented dynamics and breath behavior to expose the complexity of LVS evolution; less than 10% of phenotype changes related to ventilator settings changes. Dynamics are shown to including both stable and unstable phenotype transitions as well as both discrete and continuous changes unrelated to ventilator settings. At a cohort scale, 721 phenotypes constructed from individual data are condensed into a set of 16 groups that empirically organize around certain settings (positive end-expository pressure and ventilator mode) and structurally similar pressure-volume loop characterizations. Individual and cohort scale phenotypes, which may be refined by hypothesis-specific constructions, provide a common framework for ongoing temporal analysis and investigation of LVS dynamics.",

Ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) may propagate ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and is challenging to detect and systematically monitor because each patient takes approximately 25,000 breaths a day yet some types of VD are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all breaths. Therefore, we sought to develop and validate accurate machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect multiple types of VD by leveraging esophageal pressure waveform data to quantify patient effort with airway pressure, flow, and volume data generated during mechanical ventilation, building a computational pipeline to facilitate the study of VD.",

        "Abstract": "A normally functioning menstrual cycle requires significant crosstalk between hormones originating in ovarian and brain tissues. Reproductive hormone dysregulation may cause abnormal function and sometimes infertility. The inherent complexity in this endocrine system is a challenge to identifying mechanisms of cycle disruption, particularly given the large number of unknown parameters in existing mathematical models. We develop a new endocrine model to limit model complexity and use simulated distributions of unknown parameters for model analysis. By employing a comprehensive model evaluation, we identify a collection of mechanisms that differentiate normal and abnormal phenotypes. We also discover an intermediate phenotype-displaying relatively normal hormone levels and cycle dynamics-that is grouped statistically with the irregular phenotype. Results provide insight into how clinical symptoms associated with ovulatory disruption may not be detected through hormone measurements alone.",

        "Abstract": "Mechanical ventilation is an essential tool in the management of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), but it exposes patients to the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The human lung-ventilator system (LVS) involves the interaction of complex anatomy with a mechanical apparatus, which limits the ability of process-based models to provide individualized clinical support. This work proposes a hypothesis-driven strategy for LVS modeling in which robust personalization is achieved using a pre-defined parameter basis in a non-physiological model. Model inversion, here via windowed data assimilation, forges observed waveforms into interpretable parameter values that characterize the data rather than quantifying physiological processes. Accurate, model-based inference on human-ventilator data indicates model flexibility and utility over a variety of breath types, including those from dyssynchronous LVSs. Estimated parameters generate static characterizations of the data that are 50%-70% more accurate than breath-wise single-compartment model estimates. They also retain sufficient information to distinguish between the types of breath they represent. However, the fidelity and interpretability of model characterizations are tied to parameter definitions and model resolution. These additional factors must be considered in conjunction with the objectives of specific applications, such as identifying and tracking the development of human VILI.",

        "Title": "A Damaged-Informed Lung Ventilator Model for Ventilator Waveforms.",
        "Abstract": "Motivated by a desire to understand pulmonary physiology, scientists have developed physiological lung models of varying complexity. However, pathophysiology and interactions between human lungs and ventilators, e.g., ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), present challenges for modeling efforts. This is because the real-world pressure and volume signals may be too complex for simple models to capture, and while complex models tend not to be estimable with clinical data, limiting clinical utility. To address this gap, in this manuscript we developed a new damaged-informed lung ventilator (DILV) model. This approach relies on mathematizing ventilator pressure and volume waveforms, including lung physiology, mechanical ventilation, and their interaction. The model begins with nominal waveforms and adds limited, clinically relevant, hypothesis-driven features to the waveform corresponding to pulmonary pathophysiology, patient-ventilator interaction, and ventilator settings. The DILV model parameters uniquely and reliably recapitulate these features while having enough flexibility to reproduce commonly observed variability in clinical (human) and laboratory (mouse) waveform data. We evaluate the proof-in-principle capabilities of our modeling approach by estimating 399 breaths collected for differently damaged lungs for tightly controlled measurements in mice and uncontrolled human intensive care unit data in the absence and presence of ventilator dyssynchrony. The cumulative value of mean squares error for the DILV model is, on average, ≈12 times less than the single compartment lung model for all the waveforms considered. Moreover, changes in the estimated parameters correctly correlate with known measures of lung physiology, including lung compliance as a baseline evaluation. Our long-term goal is to use the DILV model for clinical monitoring and research studies by providing high fidelity estimates of lung state and sources of VILI with an end goal of improving management of VILI and acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Medical practice in the intensive care unit is based on the assumption that physiological systems such as the human glucose-insulin system are predictable. We demonstrate that delay within the glucose-insulin system can induce sustained temporal chaos, rendering the system unpredictable. Specifically, we exhibit such chaos for the ultradian glucose-insulin model. This well-validated, finite-dimensional model represents feedback delay as a three-stage filter. Using the theory of rank one maps from smooth dynamical systems, we precisely explain the nature of the resulting delay-induced uncertainty (DIU). We develop a framework one may use to diagnose DIU in a general oscillatory dynamical system. For infinite-dimensional delay systems, no analog of the theory of rank one maps exists. Nevertheless, we show that the geometric principles encoded in our DIU framework apply to such systems by exhibiting sustained temporal chaos for a linear shear flow. Our results are potentially broadly applicable because delay is ubiquitous throughout mathematical physiology.",

        "Title": "Ventilator dyssynchrony - Detection, pathophysiology, and clinical relevance: A Narrative review.",
        "Abstract": "Mortality associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome remains unacceptably high due in part to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Ventilator dyssynchrony is defined as the inappropriate timing and delivery of a mechanical breath in response to patient effort and may cause VILI. Such deleterious patient-ventilator interactions have recently been termed patient self-inflicted lung injury. This narrative review outlines the detection and frequency of several different types of ventilator dyssynchrony, delineates the different mechanisms by which ventilator dyssynchrony may propagate VILI, and reviews the potential clinical impact of ventilator dyssynchrony. Until recently, identifying ventilator dyssynchrony required the manual interpretation of ventilator pressure and flow waveforms. However, computerized interpretation of ventilator waive forms can detect ventilator dyssynchrony with an area under the receiver operating curve of >0.80. Using such algorithms, ventilator dyssynchrony occurs in 3%-34% of all breaths, depending on the patient population. Moreover, two types of ventilator dyssynchrony, double-triggered and flow-limited breaths, are associated with the more frequent delivery of large tidal volumes >10 mL/kg when compared with synchronous breaths (54% [95% confidence interval (CI), 47%-61%] and 11% [95% CI, 7%-15%]) compared with 0.9% (95% CI, 0.0%-1.9%), suggesting a role in propagating VILI. Finally, a recent study associated frequent dyssynchrony-defined as >10% of all breaths-with an increase in hospital mortality (67 vs. 23%, ",

Machine learning (ML) and patient generated data can identify patterns and insights at the individual level, where human cognition falls short, but not all ML-generated information is of equal utility for making health-related decisions. We develop and apply attributable components analysis (ACA), a method inspired by optimal transport theory, to type 2 diabetes self-monitoring data to identify patterns of association between nutrition and blood glucose control. In comparison with linear regression, we found that ACA offers a number of characteristics that make it promising for use in decision support applications. For example, ACA was able to identify non-linear relationships, was more robust to outliers, and offered broader and more expressive uncertainty estimates. In addition, our results highlight a tradeoff between model accuracy and interpretability, and we discuss implications for ML-driven decision support systems.",

        "Abstract": "One way to interject knowledge into clinically impactful forecasting is to use data assimilation, a nonlinear regression that projects data onto a mechanistic physiologic model, instead of a set of functions, such as neural networks. Such regressions have an advantage of being useful with particularly sparse, non-stationary clinical data. However, physiological models are often nonlinear and can have many parameters, leading to potential problems with parameter identifiability, or the ability to find a unique set of parameters that minimize forecasting error. The identifiability problems can be minimized or eliminated by reducing the number of parameters estimated, but reducing the number of estimated parameters also reduces the flexibility of the model and hence increases forecasting error. We propose a method, the parameter Houlihan, that combines traditional machine learning techniques with data assimilation, to select the right set of model parameters to minimize forecasting error while reducing identifiability problems. The method worked well: the data assimilation-based glucose forecasts and estimates for our cohort using the Houlihan-selected parameter sets generally also minimize forecasting errors compared to other parameter selection methods such as by-hand parameter selection. Nevertheless, the forecast with the lowest forecast error does not always accurately represent physiology, but further advancements of the algorithm provide a path for improving physiologic fidelity as well. Our hope is that this methodology represents a first step toward combining machine learning with data assimilation and provides a lower-threshold entry point for using data assimilation with clinical data by helping select the right parameters to estimate.",

        "Abstract": "Ensemble Kalman methods constitute an increasingly important tool in both state and parameter estimation problems. Their popularity stems from the derivative-free nature of the methodology which may be readily applied when computer code is available for the underlying state-space dynamics (for state estimation) or for the parameter-to-observable map (for parameter estimation). There are many applications in which it is desirable to enforce prior information in the form of equality or inequality constraints on the state or parameter. This paper establishes a general framework for doing so, describing a widely applicable methodology, a theory which justifies the methodology, and a set of numerical experiments exemplifying it.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce data assimilation as a computational method that uses machine learning to combine data with human knowledge in the form of mechanistic models in order to forecast future states, to impute missing data from the past by smoothing, and to infer measurable and unmeasurable quantities that represent clinically and scientifically important phenotypes. We demonstrate the advantages it affords in the context of type 2 diabetes by showing how data assimilation can be used to forecast future glucose values, to impute previously missing glucose values, and to infer type 2 diabetes phenotypes. At the heart of data assimilation is the mechanistic model, here an endocrine model. Such models can vary in complexity, contain testable hypotheses about important mechanics that govern the system (eg, nutrition's effect on glucose), and, as such, constrain the model space, allowing for accurate estimation using very little data.",

        "Title": "Methodological variations in lagged regression for detecting physiologic drug effects in EHR data.",
        "Abstract": "We studied how lagged linear regression can be used to detect the physiologic effects of drugs from data in the electronic health record (EHR). We systematically examined the effect of methodological variations ((i) time series construction, (ii) temporal parameterization, (iii) intra-subject normalization, (iv) differencing (lagged rates of change achieved by taking differences between consecutive measurements), (v) explanatory variables, and (vi) regression models) on performance of lagged linear methods in this context. We generated two gold standards (one knowledge-base derived, one expert-curated) for expected pairwise relationships between 7 drugs and 4 labs, and evaluated how the 64 unique combinations of methodological perturbations reproduce the gold standards. Our 28 cohorts included patients in the Columbia University Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital clinical database, and ranged from 2820 to 79,514 patients with between 8 and 209 average time points per patient. The most accurate methods achieved AUROC of 0.794 for knowledge-base derived gold standard (95%CI [0.741, 0.847]) and 0.705 for expert-curated gold standard (95% CI [0.629, 0.781]). We observed a mean AUROC of 0.633 (95%CI [0.610, 0.657], expert-curated gold standard) across all methods that re-parameterize time according to sequence and use either a joint autoregressive model with time-series differencing or an independent lag model without differencing. The complement of this set of methods achieved a mean AUROC close to 0.5, indicating the importance of these choices. We conclude that time-series analysis of EHR data will likely rely on some of the beneficial pre-processing and modeling methodologies identified, and will certainly benefit from continued careful analysis of methodological perturbations. This study found that methodological variations, such as pre-processing and representations, have a large effect on results, exposing the importance of thoroughly evaluating these components when comparing machine-learning methods.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health record phenotyping is the use of raw electronic health record data to assert characterizations about patients. Researchers have been doing it since the beginning of biomedical informatics, under different names. Phenotyping will benefit from an increasing focus on fidelity, both in the sense of increasing richness, such as measured levels, degree or severity, timing, probability, or conceptual relationships, and in the sense of reducing bias. Research agendas should shift from merely improving binary assignment to studying and improving richer representations. The field is actively researching new temporal directions and abstract representations, including deep learning. The field would benefit from research in nonlinear dynamics, in combining mechanistic models with empirical data, including data assimilation, and in topology. The health care process produces substantial bias, and studying that bias explicitly rather than treating it as merely another source of noise would facilitate addressing it.",

        "Title": "Personalized glucose forecasting for type 2 diabetes using data assimilation.",
        "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes leads to premature death and reduced quality of life for 8% of Americans. Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual's blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.",

Approximately one in four patients develop progressive neurological deterioration and silent infarction referred to as delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). DCI is a complex, multifactorial secondary brain injury pattern and its pathogenesis is not fully understood. We aimed to study the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neuronal activity at both the cortex and in scalp using electroencephalography (EEG) in poor-grade SAH patients undergoing multimodality intracranial neuromonitoring. Twenty patients were included, of whom half had DCI median 4.7 days (interquartile range (IQR): 4.0-5.6) from SAH bleed. The rate of decline in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was significant in both those with and without DCI and occurred between days 4 and 7 post-SAH. The scalp EEG alpha-delta ratio declined early in those with DCI. In the group without DCI, CBF and cortical EEG alpha-delta ratio were correlated (r = 0.53; p <  0.01) and in the group without DCI, inverse neurovascular coupling was observed at CPP <  80 mmHg. We found preliminary evidence that as patients enter the period of highest risk for the development of DCI, the absence of neurovascular coupling may act as a possible pathomechanism in the development of ischemia following SAH.",

We wish to develop reliable high-throughput methods for identifying adverse drug effects that are easy to implement and produce readily interpretable results. To move toward this goal, we used univariate and multivariate lagged regression models to investigate associations between twenty pairs of drug orders and laboratory measurements. Multivariate lagged regression models exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity than univariate lagged regression in the 20 examples, and incorporating autoregressive terms for labs and drugs produced more robust signals in cases of known associations among the 20 example pairings. Moreover, including inpatient admission terms in the model attenuated the signals for some cases of unlikely associations, demonstrating how multivariate lagged regression models' explicit handling of context-based variables can provide a simple way to probe for health-care processes that confound analyses of EHR data.",

        "Title": "Attenuation of rotenone toxicity in SY5Y cells by taurine and N-acetyl cysteine alone or in combination.",
        "Abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that supports the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it is plausible that a multi-targeted therapeutic approach may be a more effective strategy to retard or even potentially halt the progression of the disease. Taurine is an organic acid that has a role in the regulation of oxidative stress and promoting mitochondrial normal functions, and N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a well-known anti-oxidant and glutathione precursor. The main purpose of this study was to examine the cytoprotective effects of taurine alone or in combination with NAC against rotenone-induced toxicity in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Taurine treatment produced a concentration-dependent reduction in rotenone-induced cell death. From this, we tested sub-effective concentrations of taurine in combination with low, sub-effective concentrations of NAC against rotenone toxicity, and found the combined treatment afforded greater cytoprotection than either treatment alone. The combined taurine/NAC treatment also attenuated rotenone-induced reductions in aconitase activity suggesting the cytoprotection afforded by the combined treatment may be associated with anti-oxidative mechanisms. Together, our data suggest that a multi-targeted approach may yield new avenues of research exploring the utility of combining therapeutic agents with different mechanisms of actions at concentrations lower than previously tested and shown to be cytoprotective.",

The analysis is based on the EHR data comprising almost two decades of clinical observations collected at New York-Presbyterian, a large hospital in New York City with one of the oldest electronic health records in the United States. Our survival analysis approach centers around Bayesian multiresolution hazard modeling, with an objective to capture the changing hazard of CKD over time, adjusted for patient clinical covariates and kidney-related laboratory tests. Special attention is paid to statistical issues common to all EHR data, such as cohort definition, missing data and censoring, variable selection, and potential for joint survival and longitudinal modeling, all of which are discussed alone and within the EHR CKD context.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health record (EHR) data show promise for deriving new ways of modeling human disease states. Although EHR researchers often use numerical values of laboratory tests as features in disease models, a great deal of information is contained in the context within which a laboratory test is taken. For example, the same numerical value of a creatinine test has different interpretation for a chronic kidney disease patient and a patient with acute kidney injury. We study whether EHR research studies are subject to biased results and interpretations if laboratory measurements taken in different contexts are not explicitly separated. We show that the context of a laboratory test measurement can often be captured by the way the test is measured through time. We perform three tasks to study the properties of these temporal measurement patterns. In the first task, we confirm that laboratory test measurement patterns provide additional information to the stand-alone numerical value. The second task identifies three measurement pattern motifs across a set of 70 laboratory tests performed for over 14,000 patients. Of these, one motif exhibits properties that can lead to biased research results. In the third task, we demonstrate the potential for biased results on a specific example. We conduct an association study of lipase test values to acute pancreatitis. We observe a diluted signal when using only a lipase value threshold, whereas the full association is recovered when properly accounting for lipase measurements in different contexts (leveraging the lipase measurement patterns to separate the contexts). Aggregating EHR data without separating distinct laboratory test measurement patterns can intermix patients with different diseases, leading to the confounding of signals in large-scale EHR analyses. This paper presents a methodology for leveraging measurement frequency to identify and reduce laboratory test biases.",

We present a data assimilation framework for combining sparse measurements of the glucose regulatory system, available in the intensive care unit setting, with a nonlinear computational model to estimate unmeasured variables and unknown parameters. We also demonstrate a method for choosing the best variables for measurement. We anticipate that this framework will improve glucose maintenance therapies and shed light on the underlying biophysical process.",

        "Title": "Dietary hydroxypropyl methylcellulose increases excretion of saturated and trans fats by hamsters fed fast food diets.",
        "Abstract": "In animal studies, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) intake results in increased fecal fat excretion; however, the effects on dietary saturated fatty acids (SATs) and trans-fatty acids (TRANS) remain unknown. This study investigated the effect of HPMC on digestion and absorption of lipids in male Golden Syrian hamsters fed either freeze-dried ground pizza (PZ), pound cake (PC), or hamburger and fries (BF) supplemented with dietary fiber from either HPMC or microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) for 3 weeks. We observed greater excretion of SATs and TRANS by both diets supplemented with HPMC or MCC as compared to the feed. SAT, TRANS, and unsaturated fatty acids (UNSAT) contents of feces of the PZ diet supplemented with HPMC were 5-8 times higher than diets supplemented with MCC and tended to be higher in the PC- and BF-HPMC supplemented diets as well. We also observed significant increases in fecal excretion of bile acids (2.6-3-fold; P < 0.05), sterols (1.1-1.5-fold; P < 0.05), and unsaturated fatty acids (UNSAT, 1.7-4.5-fold; P < 0.05). The animal body weight gain was inversely correlated with the excretion of fecal lipid concentrations of bile acids (r = -0.56; P < 0.005), sterols (r = -0.48; P < 0.005), SAT (r = -0.69; P < 0.005), UNSAT (r = -0.67; P < 0.005), and TRANS (r = -0.62; P < 0.005). Therefore, HPMC may be facilitating fat excretion in a biased manner with preferential fecal excretion of both TRANS and SAT in hamsters fed fast food diets.",

        "Abstract": "Maize (Zea mays) is not considered a major allergenic food; however, when food induced allergenic and immunologic reactions have been implicated to maize, lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) have been identified as major allergens. LTP is an extremely stable protein that is resistant to both proteolytic attack and food processing, which permits the allergen to reach the gastrointestinal immune system in an immunogenic and allergenic conformation, allowing sensitization and induction of systemic symptoms. They are considered a complete food allergen in that they are capable of inducing specific IgE as well as eliciting severe symptoms. We have purified and characterized an endogenous ~9 kDa LTP from maize kernels. The maize LTP consists of 93 amino acid residues and has a M(r) of 9046.1 Da, determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Following accurate identification and characterization of maize LTP, a highly specific and quantitative assay using liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometric detection was developed. The present assay enables determination of LTP over a concentration range from 29 to 1030 μg/g in maize kernel samples. Assay recovery (percent relative error, % RE) was measured at 11 different concentrations ranging from 4 to 147 μg/mL and did not exceed 5.1%. The precision (percent coefficient of variation, % CV) was measured at 3 concentrations on each of 4 days and did not exceed 14.4%. The method was applied to evaluate the levels of LTP in 14 different maize lines. To our knowledge, this represents the first quantitative liquid chromatography-ultraviolet/mass spectrometry (LC-UV/MS) assay for the determination of LTP for the assessment of a food allergen.",

        "Abstract": "The molecular determinants of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling in mammalian cells and, in particular, those of the CNS are unclear. Here we report that primary cortical astrocyte cultures are highly responsive to both Shh protein and Hh Agonist 1.6, a selective, small molecule Smoothened agonist. Both agonists produced increases in mRNA expression of Shh-regulated gene targets, Gli-1 and Patched in a cyclopamine- and forskolin-sensitive manner. Using this model we show for the first time that Shh pathway activation mediates rapid increases in p38 MAPK phosphorylation, without altering phosphorylation of either extracellular-signal-regulated kinases or c-jun N-terminal kinases. Selective inhibition of p38 MAPK significantly attenuated Shh-dependent up-regulation of Gli-1, inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor and thrombomodulin mRNA, however did not affect expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 or a novel Shh target, membrane-associated guanylate kinase p55 subfamily member 6. Using RNAi and a constitutively-active mutant we show that Shh signaling to p38 MAPK and subsequent Gli-1 transcription requires G-protein receptor kinase 2. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a central role of G-protein receptor kinase 2-dependent p38 MAPK activity in regulating Shh-mediated gene transcription in astrocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Proteomic analysis can be hampered by the large concentration distribution of proteins. Immunoaffinity techniques have been applied to selectively remove high abundant proteins (HAP's) from samples prior to analysis. Although immunodepletion of HAP's has been shown to enable greater detection of low abundance proteins, the resulting fractions are often diluted 5-10-fold during the process. Various concentration techniques can be applied; however, many are incompatible with the high salt content of the fractions. To help overcome this limitation, a two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) method was developed which couples an IgY immunodepletion column in the first dimension with a large pore C18 analytical column in the second. A protein trap cartridge serves as an injection loop between the columns to facilitate on-line concentration and desalting. Feasibility of this 2D-LC system was demonstrated for mammalian proteomics. Beyond depletion of interfering proteins, this instrumentation provides four advantages which make immunodepletion technology more convenient, including: (1) on-line desalting (2) automatic buffer exchange (3) facile concentration and (4) fractionation by polarity.",

MMP-9 expression was significantly increased in both the frontal cortex (p = 0.002) and substantia nigra (p = 0.003) of PSP cases as compared to controls whereas MMP-1 levels were increased in the substantia nigra (p = 0.01) but unchanged in the frontal cortex (p = 0.41). Levels of the endogenous tissue inhibitors of MMPs, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were significantly elevated in the substantia nigra (TIMP-1: p = 0.004, TIMP-2: p = 0.01).

        "Abstract": "Minocycline has been shown previously to have beneficial effects against ischemia in rats as well as neuroprotective properties against excitotoxic damage in vitro, nigral cell loss via 6-hydroxydopamine, and to prolong the life-span of transgenic mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We investigated whether minocycline would protect against toxic effects of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a toxin that selectively destroys nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) neurons and produces a clinical state similar to Parkinson's disease (PD) in rodents and primates. We found that although minocycline inhibited microglial activation, it significantly exacerbated MPTP-induced damage to DA neurons. We present evidence suggesting that this effect may be due to inhibition of DA and 1-methyl-4-phenylpridium (MPP+) uptake into striatal vesicles.",

        "Abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). MMP-9 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are elevated in postmortem brain tissue of AD patients. MMPs and TIMPs are found in neurons, microglia, vascular endothelial cells and leukocytes. The aim of this study was to determine whether circulating levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are elevated in the plasma of AD patients. We compared AD patients to age- and gender-matched controls as well as to Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. There was constitutive expression of gelatinase A (MMP-2), and gelatinase B (MMP-9), in all the samples as shown by zymographic analysis. Levels of MMP-9 were significantly (P=0.003) elevated in the plasma of AD patients as compared to controls. Plasma levels of MMP-2, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were unchanged. There were no significant changes of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 levels in PD and ALS samples. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were significantly correlated with MMP-9 in the AD patients. ApoE genotyping of plasma samples showed that levels of MMP-2, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 and MMP-9 were not significantly different between the ApoE subgroups. These findings indicate that circulating levels of MMP-9 are increased in AD and may contribute to disease pathology.",

Using zymography, we found reduced MMP-2 levels in PD cases in the substantia nigra as compared to controls; levels of MMP-2 were not significantly changed in the cortex and the hippocampus. MMP-9 levels were unchanged in the investigated brain regions. Immunohistochemically, MMP-2 was localized primarily in astrocytes and microglia cells, whereas MMP-9 was predominantly neuronal. Levels of TIMP-1, an endogenous tissue inhibitor of MMPs, were significantly elevated in the substantia nigra, but not in the cortex and hippocampus. TIMP-2 levels were unchanged in PD. To investigate whether increased TIMP-1 levels in the substantia nigra might be due to increased MMP-1 expression, we measured MMP-1 levels using Western blots. MMP-1 levels were unchanged in PD cases compared to controls. Together, these data show alterations of MMP-2 and TIMP-1 in the substantia nigra of PD, consistent with the possibility that alterations in MMPs/TIMPs may contribute to disease pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Increased oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction have been suggested to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) yet the specific intracellular defects which cause and can result from these oxidative and bioenergetic defects remain unclear. To extend our previous PSP cybrid findings, we measured electron transport chain (ETC) activities in cell lines expressing mitochondrial genes from patients with PSP. Further, we measured changes in mitochondrial membrane potential as well as lipid peroxidation in PSP and control cybrids in response to mitochondrial toxins. We observed significant decreases in complex I+III activity in PSP cybrids as well as significant increases in markers of lipid oxidative damage as compared to control cybrids. These results coupled with previous reports from this and other laboratories strongly suggest contributory roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in PSP, possibly due to genetic abnormalities and/or damage of mitochondrial DNA.",

        "Abstract": "Recent evidence implicates oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Thus, we undertook a study of the activity and localization of two essential antioxidant systems (superoxide dismutase [SOD] enzymes and total glutathione) in the human post-mortem PSP and control brain. Marked increases in SOD1 (Cu/ZnSOD) activity and glutathione levels were measured within most PSP brain regions examined, whereas, only the subthalamic nucleus exhibited a significant increase (+68%) in SOD2 (MnSOD) activity. Two additional cases with mild pathological abnormalities were studied. The first (case A) may represent an example of an asymptomatic PSP case, while the second (case B) had mild pathological abnormalities consistent with typical PSP. In case A, only the STN had elevated levels of SOD activity, in the absence of an increase in tissue glutathione content. In case B, SOD activities and tissue glutathione content were elevated in several regions. Immunolocalization of the SOD1 and SOD2 proteins in paraffin-embedded tissue sections revealed a marked increase in the density of SOD immunopositive profiles (particularly glia) in the typical PSP brain, particularly within the white matter. Together, our data argues strongly in favor of the involvement of oxidative stress in the etiology and progression of PSP, and suggests that deficit in SOD or glutathione metabolism are not causative.",

        "Abstract": "A progressive impairment of mitochondrial function has been suggested to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to number of deleterious consequences including impaired calcium buffering, generation of free radicals, activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and secondary excitotoxicity. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the appearance of supranuclear gaze palsy and extrapyramidal symptoms [Arch. Neurol. 10 (1964) 333]. Although the etiological basis of PSP is unknown, compelling evidence from spectroscopy studies in PSP patients, biochemical studies in post-mortem PSP brain tissue and PSP cybrids has emerged that supports a contributory role of bio-energetic defects in the pathogenesis of PSP.",
