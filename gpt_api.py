Gogos", "articles": [{"title": "CHD2 Regulates Neuron-glioma Interactions in Pediatric Glioma.", "abstract": "High-grade gliomas (HGG) are deadly diseases for both adult and pediatric patients. Recently, it has been shown that neuronal activity promotes progression of multiple subgroups of HGG. However, epigenetic mechanisms that govern this process remain elusive. Here we report that the chromatin remodeler CHD2 regulates neuron-glioma interactions in diffuse midline glioma (DMG) characterized by onco-histone H3.1K27M. Depletion of CHD2 in H3.1K27M DMG cells compromises cell viability and neuron-to-glioma synaptic connections in vitro, neuron-induced proliferation of H3.1K27M DMG cells in vitro and in vivo, activity-dependent calcium transients in vivo, and extends the survival of H3.1K27M DMG-bearing mice. Mechanistically, CHD2 coordinates with the transcription factor FOSL1 to control the expression of axon-guidance and synaptic genes in H3.1K27M DMG cells. Together, our study reveals a mechanism whereby CHD2 controls the intrinsic gene program of the H3.1K27M DMG subtype, which in turn regulates the tumor growth-promoting interactions of glioma cells with neurons.", "pub_date": "2024-May-20"}, {"title": "Altered corollary discharge signaling in the auditory cortex of a mouse model of schizophrenia predisposition.", "abstract": "The ability to distinguish sensations that are self-generated from those caused by external events is disrupted in schizophrenia patients. However, the neural circuit abnormalities underlying this sensory impairment and its relationship to the risk factors for the disease is not well understood.

The impact of this deletion on early human brain development, however, has remained unclear. Here we harness organoid models of the developing human cerebral cortex, cultivated from subjects with 22q11.2DS and SCZ, as well as unaffected control samples, to identify cell-type-specific developmental abnormalities arising from this genomic lesion. Leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing in conjunction with experimental validation, we find that the loss of genes within the 22q11.2 locus leads to a delayed development of cortical neurons. This compromised development was reflected in an elevated proportion of actively proliferating neural progenitor cells, coupled with a decreased fraction of more mature neurons. Furthermore, we identify perturbed molecular imprints linked to neuronal maturation, observe the presence of sparser neurites, and note a blunted amplitude in glutamate-induced Ca2+ transients. The aberrant transcription program underlying impaired development contains molecular signatures significantly enriched in neuropsychiatric genetic liability. MicroRNA profiling and target gene investigation suggest that microRNA dysregulation may drive perturbations of genes governing the pace at which maturation unfolds. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis we define complementary effects stemming from additional genes residing within the deleted locus. Our study uncovers reproducible neurodevelopmental and molecular alterations due to 22q11.2 deletions. These findings have the potential to facilitate disease modeling and promote the pursuit of therapeutic interventions.", "pub_date": "2023-Oct-05"}, {"title": "An in vitro model of neuronal ensembles.", "abstract": "Advances in 3D neuronal cultures, such as brain spheroids and organoids, are allowing unprecedented in vitro access to some of the molecular, cellular and developmental mechanisms underlying brain diseases. However, their efficacy in recapitulating brain network properties that encode brain function remains limited, thereby precluding development of effective in vitro models of complex brain disorders like schizophrenia. Here, we develop and characterize a Modular Neuronal Network (MoNNet) approach that recapitulates specific features of neuronal ensemble dynamics, segregated local-global network activities and a hierarchical modular organization. We utilized MoNNets for quantitative in vitro modelling of schizophrenia-related network dysfunctions caused by highly penetrant mutations in SETD1A and 22q11.2 risk loci. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility for drug discovery by performing pharmacological rescue of alterations in neuronal ensembles stability and global network synchrony. MoNNets allow in vitro modelling of brain diseases for investigating the underlying neuronal network mechanisms and systematic drug discovery.", "pub_date": "2022-Jun-09"}, {"title": "Vascular-derived SPARC and SerpinE1 regulate interneuron tangential migration and accelerate functional maturation of human stem cell-derived interneurons.", "abstract": "Cortical interneurons establish inhibitory microcircuits throughout the neocortex and their dysfunction has been implicated in epilepsy and neuropsychiatric diseases. Developmentally, interneurons migrate from a distal progenitor domain in order to populate the neocortex - a process that occurs at a slower rate in humans than in mice. In this study, we sought to identify factors that regulate the rate of interneuron maturation across the two species. Using embryonic mouse development as a model system, we found that the process of initiating interneuron migration is regulated by blood vessels of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), an interneuron progenitor domain. We identified two endothelial cell-derived paracrine factors, SPARC and SerpinE1, that enhance interneuron migration in mouse MGE explants and organotypic cultures. Moreover, pre-treatment of human stem cell-derived interneurons (hSC-interneurons) with SPARC and SerpinE1 prior to transplantation into neonatal mouse cortex enhanced their migration and morphological elaboration in the host cortex. Further, SPARC and SerpinE1-treated hSC-interneurons also exhibited more mature electrophysiological characteristics compared to controls. Overall, our studies suggest a critical role for CNS vasculature in regulating interneuron developmental maturation in both mice and humans.", "pub_date": "2021-Apr-27"}, {"title": "Reset of hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry facilitates learning.", "abstract": "The ability to rapidly\u00a0adapt to novel situations is essential for survival, and this flexibility\u00a0is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders", "pub_date": "2021"}, {"title": "Aberrant Cortical Ensembles and Schizophrenia-like Sensory Phenotypes in Setd1a", "abstract": "A breakdown of synchrony within neuronal ensembles leading to destabilization of network \"attractors\" could be a defining aspect of neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, representing a common downstream convergence point for the diverse etiological pathways associated with the disease. Using a mouse genetic model, we demonstrated that altered ensembles are associated with pathological sensory cortical processing phenotypes resulting from loss of function mutations in the Setd1a gene, a recently identified rare risk genotype with very high penetrance for schizophrenia.", "pub_date": "2020-Aug-01"}, {"title": "Recapitulation and Reversal of Schizophrenia-Related Phenotypes in Setd1a-Deficient Mice.", "abstract": "SETD1A, a lysine-methyltransferase, is a key schizophrenia susceptibility gene. Mice carrying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the orthologous gene exhibit alterations in axonal branching and cortical synaptic dynamics accompanied by working memory deficits. We show that Setd1a binds both promoters and enhancers with a striking overlap between Setd1a and Mef2 on enhancers. Setd1a targets\u00a0are highly expressed in pyramidal neurons and display a complex pattern of transcriptional up- and downregulations shaped by presumed opposing functions of Setd1a on promoters and Mef2-bound enhancers. Notably, evolutionarily conserved Setd1a targets are associated with neuropsychiatric genetic risk burden. Reinstating Setd1a expression in adulthood rescues cognitive deficits. Finally, we identify LSD1 as a major counteracting demethylase for Setd1a and show that its pharmacological antagonism results in a full rescue of the behavioral and morphological deficits in Setd1a-deficient mice. Our findings advance understanding of how SETD1A mutations predispose to schizophrenia (SCZ) and point to novel therapeutic interventions.", "pub_date": "2019-Nov-06"}, {"title": "The abiding relevance of mouse models of rare mutations to psychiatric neuroscience and therapeutics.", "abstract": "Studies using powerful family-based designs aided by large scale case-control studies, have been instrumental in cracking the genetic complexity of the disease, identifying rare and highly penetrant risk mutations and providing a handle on experimentally tractable model systems. Mouse models of rare mutations, paired with analysis of homologous cognitive and sensory processing deficits and state-of-the-art neuroscience methods to manipulate and record neuronal activity have started providing unprecedented insights into pathogenic mechanisms and building the foundation of a new biological framework for understanding mental illness. A number of important principles are emerging, namely that degradation of the computational mechanisms underlying the ordered activity and plasticity of both local and long-range neuronal assemblies, the building blocks necessary for stable cognition and perception, might be the inevitable consequence and the common point of convergence of the vastly heterogeneous genetic liability, manifesting as defective internally- or stimulus-driven neuronal activation patterns and triggering the constellation of schizophrenia symptoms. Animal models of rare mutations have the unique potential to help us move from \"which\" (gene) to \"how\", \"where\" and \"when\" computational regimes of neural ensembles are affected. Linking these variables should improve our understanding of how symptoms emerge and how diagnostic boundaries are established at a circuit level. Eventually, a better understanding of pathophysiological trajectories at the level of neural circuitry in mice, aided by basic human experimental biology, should guide the development of new therapeutics targeting either altered circuitry itself or the underlying biological pathways.", "pub_date": "2020"}, {"title": "Systems Analysis of the 22q11.2 Microdeletion Syndrome Converges on a Mitochondrial Interactome Necessary for Synapse Function and Behavior.", "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders offer insight into synaptic mechanisms.

Of these, genetic animal models that are modeled after rare but highly penetrant mutations hold great promise for deciphering critical molecular, synaptic, and neurocircuitry deficits of major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Animal models should aim to focus on core aspects rather than capture the entire human disease. In this context, animal models with strong etiological validity, where behavioral and neurophysiological phenotypes and the features of the disease being modeled are in unambiguous homology, are being used to dissect both elementary and complex cognitive and perceptual processing deficits present in psychiatric disorders at the level of neurocircuitry, shedding new light on critical disease mechanisms. Recent progress in neuroscience along with large-scale initiatives that propose a consistent approach in characterizing these deficits across different laboratories will further enhance the efficacy of these studies that will ultimately lead to identifying new biological targets for drug development.", "pub_date": "2019"}, {"title": "Role of Endogenous Metabolite Alterations in Neuropsychiatric Disease.", "abstract": "The potential role in neuropsychiatric disease risk arising from alterations and derangements of endogenous small-molecule metabolites remains understudied. Alterations of endogenous metabolite concentrations can arise in multiple ways. Marked derangements of single endogenous small-molecule metabolites are found in a large group of rare genetic human diseases termed \"inborn errors of metabolism\", many of which are associated with prominent neuropsychiatric symptomology. Whether such metabolites act neuroactively to directly lead to distinct neural dysfunction has been frequently hypothesized but rarely demonstrated unequivocally. Here we discuss this disease concept in the context of our recent findings demonstrating that neural dysfunction arising from accumulation of the schizophrenia-associated metabolite l-proline is due to its structural mimicry of the neurotransmitter GABA that leads to alterations in GABA-ergic short-term synaptic plasticity. For cases in which a similar direct action upon neurotransmitter binding sites is suspected, we lay out a systematic approach that can be extended to assessing the potential disruptive action of such candidate disease metabolites. To address the potentially important and broader role in neuropsychiatric disease, we also consider whether the more subtle yet more ubiquitous variations in endogenous metabolites arising from natural allelic variation may likewise contribute to disease risk but in a more complex and nuanced manner.", "pub_date": "2018-Sep-19"}, {"title": "Altered function and maturation of primary cortical neurons from a 22q11.2 deletion mouse model of schizophrenia.", "abstract": "Given its high penetrance, clearly delineated and evolutionary conserved genomic structure, mouse models of the 22q11.2 deletion provide an ideal organism-based and cell-based model of this well-established disease mutation for schizophrenia.

However, little is known about whether and how long-range cross-frequency coupling across distant brain regions subserves working memory. Here we report that theta-slow gamma coupling between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is augmented in a genetic mouse model of cognitive dysfunction. This increased cross-frequency coupling is observed specifically when the mice successfully perform a spatial working memory task. In wild-type mice, increasing task difficulty by introducing a long delay or by optogenetically interfering with encoding, also increases theta-gamma coupling during correct trials. Finally, epochs of high hippocampal theta-prefrontal slow gamma coupling are associated with increased synchronization of neurons within the mPFC. These findings suggest that enhancement of theta-slow gamma coupling reflects a compensatory mechanism to maintain spatial working memory performance in the setting of increased difficulty.", "pub_date": "2017-Dec-19"}, {"title": "EMC10 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Protein Complex Subunit 10) Is a Bone Marrow-Derived Angiogenic Growth Factor Promoting Tissue Repair After Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Clinical trials of bone marrow cell-based therapies after acute myocardial infarction (MI) have produced mostly neutral results.

Curiosity is inversely associated with confidence, suggesting that it is triggered by states of low confidence (subjective uncertainty). The neural mechanisms of this process, however, have been little investigated. What are the mechanisms through which uncertainty about an event gives rise to curiosity about that event? Inspired by studies of sensory uncertainty, we hypothesized that visual areas provide multivariate representations of uncertainty, which are then read out by higher-order structures to generate signals of confidence and, ultimately, trigger curiosity. During fMRI, participants (17 female, 15 male) performed a new task in which they rated their confidence in identifying distorted images of animals and objects and their curiosity to see the clear image. To link sensory certainty and curiosity, we measured the activity evoked by each image in occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) and devised a new metric of \"OTC Certainty\" indicating the strength of evidence this activity conveys about the animal vs. object categories. We show that, consistent with findings using trivia questions, perceptual curiosity peaked at low confidence. Moreover, OTC Certainty negatively correlated with curiosity, establishing a link between curiosity and a multivariate representation of sensory uncertainty. Finally, univariate (average) activity in two frontal areas - vmPFC and ACC - correlated positively with confidence and negatively with curiosity, and the vmPFC mediated the relationship between OTC Certainty and curiosity. The results suggest that multiple mechanisms link curiosity with representations of confidence and uncertainty.", "pub_date": "2024-Jul-05"}, {"title": "The parieto-occipital cortex is a candidate neural substrate for the human ability to approximate Bayesian inference.", "abstract": "Adaptive decision-making often requires one to infer unobservable states based on incomplete information. Bayesian logic prescribes that individuals should do so by estimating the posterior probability by integrating the prior probability with new information, but the neural basis of this integration is incompletely understood. We record fMRI during a task in which participants infer the posterior probability of a hidden state while we independently modulate the prior probability and likelihood of evidence regarding the state; the task incentivizes participants to make accurate inferences and dissociates expected value from posterior probability. Here we show that activation in a region of left parieto-occipital cortex independently tracks the subjective posterior probability, combining its subcomponents of prior probability and evidence likelihood, and reflecting the individual participants' systematic deviations from objective probabilities. The parieto-occipital cortex is thus a candidate neural substrate for humans' ability to approximate Bayesian inference by integrating prior beliefs with new information.", "pub_date": "2024-Feb-09"}, {"title": "A Distinct Neural Code Supports Prospection of Future Probabilities During Instrumental Information-Seeking.", "abstract": "To make adaptive decisions, we must actively demand information, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms of active information gathering. An open question is how the brain estimates expected information gains (EIG) when comparing the current decision uncertainty with the uncertainty that is expected after gathering information. We examined this question using fMRI in a task in which people placed bids to obtain information in conditions that varied independently by prior decision uncertainty, information diagnosticity, and the penalty for an erroneous choice. Consistent with value of information theory, bids were sensitive to EIG and its components of prior certainty and expected posterior certainty. Expected posterior certainty was decoded above chance from multivoxel activation patterns in the posterior parietal and extrastriate cortices. This representation was independent of instrumental rewards and overlapped with distinct representations of EIG and prior certainty. Thus, posterior parietal and extrastriate cortices are candidates for mediating the prospection of posterior probabilities as a key step to estimate EIG during active information gathering.", "pub_date": "2023-Nov-27"}, {"title": "Beta traveling waves in monkey frontal and parietal areas encode recent reward history.", "abstract": "Brain function depends on neural communication, but the mechanisms of this communication are not well understood. Recent studies suggest that one form of neural communication is through traveling waves (TWs)-patterns of neural oscillations that propagate within and between brain areas. We show that TWs are robust in microarray recordings in frontal and parietal cortex and encode recent reward history. Two adult male monkeys made saccades to obtain probabilistic rewards and were sensitive to the (statistically irrelevant) reward on the previous trial. TWs in frontal and parietal areas were stronger in trials that followed a prior reward versus a lack of reward and, in the frontal lobe, correlated with the monkeys' behavioral sensitivity to the prior reward.

Little is known about how people make this selection and specifically, how they identify individual observations that best predict the value of a multi-attribute situation. Here show that, in a simple task of information demand, participants inefficiently query attributes that have high individual value but are relatively uninformative about a total payoff. This inefficiency is robust in two instrumental conditions in which gathering less informative observations leads to significantly lower rewards. Across individuals, variations in the sensitivity to informativeness is associated with personality metrics, showing\u00a0negative associations with extraversion and thrill seeking and positive associations with stress tolerance and need for cognition. Thus, people select informative queries using sub-optimal strategies that are associated with personality traits and influence consequential choices.", "pub_date": "2023-Jun-01"}, {"title": "A Reinforcement Meta-Learning framework of executive function and information demand.", "abstract": "Gathering information is crucial for maximizing fitness, but requires diverting resources from searching directly for primary rewards to actively exploring the environment. Optimal decision-making thus maximizes information while reducing effort costs, but little is known about the neuro-computational implementation of this tradeoff. We present a Reinforcement Meta-Learning (RML) computational model that solves the trade-off between the value and costs of gathering information. We implement the RML in a biologically plausible architecture that links catecholaminergic neuromodulators, the medial prefrontal cortex and topographically organized visual maps and show that it accounts for neural and behavioral findings on information demand motivated by instrumental incentives and intrinsic utility. Moreover, the utility function used by the RML, encoded by dopamine, is an approximation of variational free energy.

We replicated prior results that monkeys reliably learned the implicit order of the learnable set. Surprisingly, the monkeys behaved as though some ordering also existed in the unlearnable set, showing consistent choice preference that transferred to novel untrained pairs in this set, even under a preference-discouraging reward schedule that gave rewards more frequently to the stimulus that was selected less often.

Computational theories propose different heuristics, including competence measures (e.g., percent correct) and learning progress, that could be used as intrinsic utility functions to efficiently organize exploration. Such intrinsic utilities constitute computationally cheap but smart heuristics to prevent people from laboring in vain on unlearnable activities, while still motivating them to self-challenge on difficult learnable activities. Here, we provide empirical evidence for these ideas by means of a free-choice experimental paradigm and computational modeling. We show that while humans rely on competence information to avoid easy tasks, models that include a learning-progress component provide the best fit to task selection data.

Reward sensitivity, in turn, is unreliable across task contexts, inconsistent with the view that the cells encode economic utility.

We distinguish between information sampling, in which organisms reduce uncertainty relevant to a familiar task, and information search, in which they investigate in an open-ended fashion to discover new tasks. We review evidence that both sampling and search depend on individual preferences over cognitive states, including attitudes towards uncertainty, learning progress and types of information.

In this paper I review recent studies that address questions of attentional learning, cue validity and information seeking in humans and non-human primates. These studies suggest that learning a sampling policy involves large scale interactions between networks of attention and valuation, which implement these policies based on reward maximization, uncertainty reduction and the intrinsic utility of cognitive states.
