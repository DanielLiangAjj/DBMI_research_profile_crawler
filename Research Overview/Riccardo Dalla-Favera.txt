Researcher: Riccardo Dalla-Favera
Research Overview:
Riccardo Dalla-Favera's research primarily focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying B cell lymphomas, particularly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). His work extensively explores the role of key genetic and epigenetic factors, such as CREBBP and KMT2D, in regulating gene expression during critical phases of B cell development, including germinal center reactions and differentiation into memory B cells and plasma cells. Utilizing advanced techniques like single-cell analysis and mouse models, Dalla-Favera investigates the interplay between acetylation processes, DNA damage responses, and alternative end-joining mechanisms in lymphomagenesis. His studies shed light on immune evasion strategies employed by malignant B cells, emphasizing the importance of transcriptional networks and specific mutations associated with lymphomas. Overall, his research significantly contributes to understanding the pathogenic landscape of B cell malignancies and aids in the development of targeted therapies.
