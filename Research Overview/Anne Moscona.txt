Researcher: Anne Moscona
Research Overview:
Anne Moscona's research primarily focuses on the virology of emerging viral pathogens, with a significant emphasis on SARS-CoV-2 and its implications in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her studies delve into critical aspects such as viral fusion mechanisms, antiviral strategies, and vaccine development, addressing concerns related to biosecurity and oversight of gain-of-function research. Utilizing advanced methodologies like cryo-electron tomography and proteomics, she investigates the viral entry processes, immune responses, and the pathogenesis of respiratory viruses, including influenza and paramyxoviruses. Her work is vital in understanding zoonotic transmissions and developing therapeutic interventions, thus contributing significantly to pandemic preparedness and public health strategies against viral diseases.
