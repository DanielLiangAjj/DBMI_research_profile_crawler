Researcher: Sheng-Han Kuo
Research Overview:
Sheng-Han Kuo's research extensively explores the domains of cerebellar ataxias, essential tremor, and their implications on cognitive and emotional functioning. A significant focus is placed on understanding the natural history and clinical outcomes associated with spinocerebellar ataxias, particularly regarding their non-motor symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and impulsivity as well as their impact on patients' quality of life. Kuo's work involves assessing decision-making processes and risk-taking behaviors through neuropsychological tests, further linking emotional states to neurophysiological mechanisms within the cerebellum. The integration of genetic studies and advances in neuroimaging has enabled deeper insights into the pathophysiological pathways underpinning these neurodegenerative conditions. Additionally, the research emphasizes rehabilitative approaches, including physical therapy modalities and novel therapeutic interventions like deep brain stimulation, underscoring a commitment to improving treatment outcomes for those affected. This advocacy for multidisciplinary approaches reflects Kuo's commitment to enhancing understanding and management of cerebellar disorders within a clinical setting.
