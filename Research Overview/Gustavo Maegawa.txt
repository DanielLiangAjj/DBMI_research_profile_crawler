Researcher: Gustavo Maegawa
Research Overview:
Gustavo Maegawa's research primarily focuses on lysosomal storage diseases and their molecular underpinnings, particularly examining disorders like Niemann-Pick disease, Fabry disease, and Krabbe disease. His work explores the complexities of genotype-phenotype correlations, highlighting the impact of genetic variants, including missense mutations and copy number variations, on disease expression and progression. Through advanced methodologies such as whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and chemical proteomics, Maegawa investigates novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies, including enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy. His studies also extend to the role of autophagy and ubiquitin pathways in disease mechanisms, as well as the immunogenicity of treatments, such as the generation of anti-drug antibodies in patients receiving pegunigalsidase alfa for Fabry disease. Overall, Maegawa's contributions aim to enhance our understanding of lysosomal disorders, improving diagnostic approaches and development of effective therapeutic interventions while addressing the intersection of genetics, neurology, and disease management.
