Researcher: Siddhartha Mukherjee
Research Overview:
Siddhartha Mukherjee's research encompasses a wide range of topics primarily focused on molecular biology, oncology, and environmental health. His work delves into the intricacies of cancer mechanisms, particularly acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal cancer, exploring therapeutic approaches like CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and immunotherapy, while also investigating the tumor microenvironment and the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Furthermore, Mukherjee addresses environmental hazards posed by microplastics and heavy metals in soil and water, assessing their impact on biological systems and developing remediation strategies. His studies involve both in vitro and in vivo models, including genetically engineered mice and hematopoietic stem cells. Insights into stem cell behavior, erythropoiesis, and the microenvironment's influence on cancer progression are significant themes throughout his work. Mukherjee's research is vital to advancing cancer treatment methodologies while promoting awareness of ecological health challenges.
