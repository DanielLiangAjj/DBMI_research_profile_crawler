Researcher: Munemasa Mori
Research Overview:
Munemasa Mori's research primarily focuses on advanced topics in stem cell biology, regenerative medicine, and organ generation, particularly through the lens of blastocyst complementation and chimeric models. Utilizing pluripotent stem cells, including human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, Mori explores mechanisms for organ generation and differentiation, with a significant interest in lung and salivary gland development. His studies employ various animal models, especially mice and swine, to investigate the roles of various signaling pathways, such as FGF, Notch, and Wnt, in development and regeneration. Additionally, his work addresses the potential of bioengineered materials, including hydrogels and metal-organic frameworks, for creating environments conducive to tissue regeneration. Notably, Mori's research extends to the interplay of cellular mechanisms during lung development and immune responses, highlighting implications for diseases such as colitis and influenza. Overall, his contributions aim to bridge gaps in understanding stem cell functionality and implement strategies for human organ generation and repair, paving the way for future advancements in regenerative therapies.
