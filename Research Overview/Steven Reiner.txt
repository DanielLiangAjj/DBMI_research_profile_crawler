Researcher: Steven Reiner
Research Overview:
Steven Reiner's research primarily focuses on the intricate dynamics of CD8(+) T cells in the context of cancer immunology and therapy. His studies extensively explore critical pathways involving the PI3K signaling cascade, TCF1, and PD-1, emphasizing their roles in T cell differentiation, asymmetric cell division, and self-renewal mechanisms. A significant portion of his work investigates the balance between co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory signals, particularly in cancer environments where immune evasion is prevalent, underlining the challenges of resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Reiner also delves into the metabolic aspects of immune response, studying the implications of factors such as obesity and microbiota on mucosal immunity and autoimmunity, alongside cancer. Additionally, his utilization of cutting-edge techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9 screening allows for in-depth analysis of T cell functions and memory formation, thereby providing insights into targeted immunotherapies and strategies to enhance the efficacy of treatments like CAR-T and antibody-drug conjugates. Overall, his work significantly advances our understanding of immune responses and their manipulation in both cancer and autoimmune diseases.
