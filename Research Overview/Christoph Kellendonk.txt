Researcher: Christoph Kellendonk
Research Overview:
Christoph Kellendonk's research is primarily focused on the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive processes and behavioral flexibility during adolescence, with particular emphasis on the roles of dopamine and cholinergic systems in brain development and dysfunction. His investigations elucidate how the maturation of the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, particularly through dopaminergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, influences cognitive flexibility, motivation, and responses to reward and addictionâ€”especially in the context of disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. By utilizing mouse models and advanced techniques such as optogenetics, the research explores the complex interactions of various neuronal circuits, including thalamocortical pathways and cholinergic interneurons, in shaping behavioral responses. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how the excitation-inhibition balance is crucial for cognitive functions and the potential implications for treating neuropsychiatric conditions that emerge during adolescence. Thus, Kellendonk's work significantly enhances our knowledge of the neural mechanisms behind cognitive flexibility and behavioral adaptations, which are essential for goal-directed behaviors and overall mental health.
