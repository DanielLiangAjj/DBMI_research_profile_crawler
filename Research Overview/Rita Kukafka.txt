Research Overview:
Rita Kukafkaâ€™s research is centered on the intersection of genetic testing, particularly for BRCA1/2 mutations, and its implications for breast cancer prevention in diverse communities, notably the Orthodox Jewish population. Her work emphasizes the significance of community-based participatory research methodologies to address barriers in accessing genetic testing and risk assessment while promoting equitable health outcomes among minority women. Kukafka's studies explore the psychological and social dimensions influencing medical decision-making, including perceived risks related to breast density and chronic diseases such as diabetes, highlighting the importance of shared decision-making and health education. Additionally, she incorporates innovative approaches such as digital health technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance patient engagement, decision support, and overall healthcare communication. Her commitment to advancing translational genomic efforts and improving health literacy reflects a robust dedication to addressing healthcare disparities, ensuring informed consumer health information, and fostering a holistic approach to cancer prevention and chronic disease management in diverse populations.
