Researcher: Zachary Mannes
Research Overview:
Zachary Mannes' research primarily focuses on the intersection of cannabis use, substance-related disorders, and mental health among veterans and other populations affected by chronic pain, opioid use disorders, and various psychosocial factors. His work explores the prevalence and epidemiology of cannabis and opioid use, emphasizing the implications for mental health and substance use disorders, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Mannes utilizes big data and electronic health records to analyze treatment outcomes within the Veterans Health Administration, investigating issues such as prescription opioid use, opioid withdrawal syndrome, and comorbidities related to mental health and chronic pain. His studies also address barriers to healthcare access and the role of social determinants, such as ethnicity, in shaping substance misuse and its treatment, ultimately contributing to the understanding and improvement of veterans' health policies and interventions. Through his research, Mannes aims to inform addiction treatment strategies and enhance the quality of life for veterans facing these challenges.
