Researcher: Isabelle Schrauwen
Research Overview:
Isabelle Schrauwen's research primarily focuses on the genetic underpinnings of neurodevelopmental disorders and hearing impairments, particularly through the use of advanced genomic techniques, including optical genome mapping and exome sequencing. Her studies explore the role of copy number variants and structural variants in various syndromes such as Rett syndrome, Donnai-Barrow syndrome, and polydactyly-associated conditions. Schrauwen investigates the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with genetic mutations, often observed in diverse populations, including those from Africa and Pakistan. Employing integrative omics and targeted resequencing, her work aims to identify pathogenic variants linked to intellectual disabilities, neurological disorders, and syndromic hearing loss. Additionally, Schrauwen examines the intricate proteinâ€“protein interaction networks that underpin these conditions, emphasizing deep-intronic and aberrant splicing variants, as well as the clinical implications of her findings in understanding non-Mendelian inheritance patterns and improving diagnostic accuracy for unexplained cases in pediatric neurology. Overall, her research has significant implications for the genetic diagnosis of hearing loss and neurodevelopmental disorders, contributing to a better understanding of their complexity and variation.
