Researcher: Ning Qian
Research Overview:
Ning Qian's research is characterized by a multi-faceted exploration into cancer biology, neuroscience, and environmental impacts, with a strong emphasis on the mechanisms underlying tumor progression, treatment resistance, and therapeutic interventions. Key areas of focus include the role of various molecular pathways in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer, particularly the involvement of NFE2L1, VEGFA/NRP-1/GAPVD1 axis, and microRNAs such as miR-26a-5p and miR-10b-5p in regulating cancer stem cell dynamics and tumor microenvironment interactions. Additionally, Qian's work integrates studies on the effects of metformin as an adjunct treatment and the exploration of drug delivery systems, including mesoporous organic silica nanoparticles and polymeric micelles, for enhancing therapeutic efficacy. The influence of environmental factors, such as air pollutants on cancer progression and immune responses, alongside the investigation of immune checkpoint inhibitors, highlights the interdisciplinary nature of Qian's research. By bridging cancer biology with insights from neuroscience and ecological risk assessments, Ning Qian contributes significantly to advancing understanding in these critical areas, with implications for improving cancer treatment outcomes and understanding the interplay between environmental factors and health.
