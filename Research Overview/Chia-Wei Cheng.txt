Researcher: Chia-Wei Cheng
Research Overview:
Chia-Wei Cheng's research predominantly focuses on the mechanisms governing stem cell biology, particularly in relation to intestinal stem cells and their roles in regeneration, plasticity, and metabolism. Through advanced methodologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and proteomics, Cheng investigates the regulatory networks, metabolic pathways, and gene expression dynamics that influence stem cell potency and differentiation. The work also explores the impact of dietary factors, including ketogenic diets and fasting regimens, on stem cell function and aging, examining metabolic shifts, specifically fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production, alongside the implications for intestinal health and disease states such as colon cancer and nephrolithiasis. The integration of metabolomics and epigenomics underscores the multifaceted influences on stem cell behavior, aiming to elucidate their potential applications in regenerative medicine and disease treatment. Ultimately, Cheng's contributions advance our understanding of stem cell dynamics and their therapeutic potential through a nuanced exploration of metabolic and environmental factors.
