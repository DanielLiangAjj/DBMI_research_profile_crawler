Researcher: Michael Goldberg
Research Overview:
Michael Goldberg's research primarily encompasses advancements in immunotherapy, cancer biomarkers, and systems immunology. He employs machine learning techniques in combination with cellular immunoprofiling methods—such as RNA sequencing and flow cytometry—to explore the immune responses of various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, in cancer patients. His work aids in the development of cancer immunotherapies that utilize immune checkpoint blockade strategies and presents significant implications for personalized medicine by establishing immunotype signatures as potential biomarkers. Further, Goldberg's investigations into food allergies, particularly oral immunotherapy approaches, highlight his diverse inquiry into desensitization processes in various hypersensitivity conditions. Overall, his research aims to bridge the gap between complex biology and clinical applications, focusing on improving patient outcomes in both oncological and immunological settings.
