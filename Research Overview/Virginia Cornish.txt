Researcher: Virginia Cornish
Research Overview:
Virginia Cornish's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily centered around synthetic biology, microbial genetics, and innovative therapeutic strategies. Her work extensively investigates the functionalities of various yeast species, particularly *Saccharomyces boulardii* and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, in processes like gene therapy, cell and tissue-based therapies, and the development of low-cost diagnostic tools for invasive fungal infections. Cornish employs cutting-edge methodologies such as CRISPR gene editing, bacterial engineering, and high-throughput screening to explore applications in cellular engineering and receptor engineering, notably within CAR T cell therapy contexts. Her interest in biosensors aligns with her goal of enhancing diagnostic techniques, leveraging peptide biomarkers and D-amino acids to establish point-of-care testing frameworks. Furthermore, her studies on protein interactions and localization contribute to our understanding of molecular dynamics in the cellular environment. Collectively, her research aims to harness genetic engineering and synthetic biology to improve health outcomes through novel, cost-effective, and efficient biotechnology applications.
