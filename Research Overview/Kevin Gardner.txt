Researcher: Kevin Gardner
Research Overview:
Kevin Gardner's research focuses on the complex interplay between molecular mechanisms, protein interactions, and cancer health disparities, particularly in breast and prostate cancer. His work incorporates advanced biophysical techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and optogenetics to elucidate the signaling pathways involved in these cancers, including the roles of histidine kinases and transcription factors such as Kaiso and ARNT. Additionally, he investigates the influence of environmental factors, such as high-fat diets and their impact on metabolic syndrome, emphasizing how these factors contribute to cancer disparities among different racial groups, particularly African Americans. Gardner's exploration of the tumor microenvironment and immune composition informs the development of biomarkers and therapeutic strategies, including drug combinations and immunotherapy, aimed at enhancing patient outcomes. His research is not only foundational in understanding molecular and cellular dynamics within cancer biology but also vital for addressing the socio-economic and health disparities affecting diverse populations.
