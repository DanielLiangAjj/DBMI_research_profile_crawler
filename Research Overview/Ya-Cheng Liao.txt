Researcher: Ya-Cheng Liao
Research Overview:
Ya-Cheng Liao's research primarily focuses on the interplay between cellular organelles, particularly lysosomes and peroxisomes, in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). By investigating key components and processes including autophagy, local translation, and phase separation, Liao explores how cellular stress affects organelle function and intercommunication. The research utilizes advanced techniques like FIB-SEM and in vitro reconstitution assays to elucidate the roles of proteins such as ANXA11 and mTOR in lysosomal dynamics and calcium signaling. Furthermore, the study of RNA transport mechanisms and the impact of cholesterol transfer adds depth to understanding neurodegeneration and organelle contact sites. Overall, Liao's work contributes valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular transport and stress responses, with potential implications for developing therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.
