Researcher: Edmund Au
Research Overview:
Edmund Au's research encompasses a multifaceted exploration of RNA-binding proteins, particularly focusing on the role of Elavl2 in RNA splicing regulation and its implications for the development and functioning of neuronal subtypes, particularly cortical interneurons. His work integrates techniques of network inference and calcium imaging to investigate neural dynamics and specific actions of interneurons in the prefrontal cortex, shedding light on their spatial distribution and functional properties. The studies often utilize various mouse models, including transgenic and knockout strains, to elucidate the processes of neurogenesis, interneuron differentiation, and the effects of substances like alcohol on neural circuits. Au’s research significantly contributes to the understanding of brain development and developmental biology by examining the interactions of clustered protocadherins and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Furthermore, his investigations touch on physiological processes such as neovascularization and signal transduction within the neural context, employing genetic engineering and optogenetic methodologies. Overall, Au’s work provides valuable insights into the intricate mechanics of neuronal networks and their implications for both normal brain function and neurodevelopmental disorders.
