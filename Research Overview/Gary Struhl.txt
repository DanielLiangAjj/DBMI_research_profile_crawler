Researcher: Gary Struhl
Research Overview:
Gary Struhl's research primarily investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying developmental processes and organ size control in model organisms, particularly *C. elegans* and *Drosophila melanogaster*. His work focuses on the role of signaling pathways, such as the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, and their interactions with key proteins like ADAM proteases, Epsin, and various ligands. Notably, he explores the concept of mechano-reception, where mechanical forces influence cellular signaling and processes like ligand endocytosis and ectodomain shedding. Struhl's research also delves into the regulation of gene expression during development, highlighting the influence of hormonal signals like ecdysone and the roles of the Hippo/Warts tumor suppressor pathway in maintaining organ size and homeostasis. Through a comprehensive approach combining genetic, biochemical, and biophysical techniques, Struhl's contributions enhance our understanding of morphogenesis, cell adhesion, and mechanotransduction, illuminating fundamental principles that govern organismal development and the regulation of tissue growth.
