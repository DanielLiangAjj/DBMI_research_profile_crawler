Researcher: Janet Sparrow
Research Overview:
Janet Sparrow's research primarily focuses on retinal health and the mechanisms underlying retinal diseases, particularly those associated with lipid metabolism and the function of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Her work explores the interactions of apolipoproteins, such as APOB-containing lipoproteins and retinoids, in the pathogenesis of retinal disorders like age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease. Utilizing a range of methodologies, including fundus autofluorescence imaging and quantitative analysis, she investigates the implications of lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and gene mutations on photoreceptor function and survival. Additionally, Sparrow examines the role of various genetic factors and environmental influences, such as dietary composition and iron deficiency, in the progression of retinal degeneration. Through her research, she aims to elucidate the intricate mechanisms that contribute to visual impairment and to develop potential therapeutic strategies, including gene therapy, for inherited retinal diseases.
