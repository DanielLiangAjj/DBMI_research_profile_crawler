Researcher: Jianing Fu
Research Overview:
Jianing Fu's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily centered around immunology and transplantation, with particular emphasis on understanding immune responses and tolerance mechanisms in both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Key areas of exploration include bidirectional alloresponse, chimerism, and the profiling of immune cells such as tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) and their T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, particularly in the context of intestinal transplantation and conditions like graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The influence of the NLRP3 inflammasome and pharmacological agents like Silibinin on apoptosis, senescence, and cellular dynamics in cancer treatment has also been extensively studied. Moreover, the implications of viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, on immune responses are examined, shedding light on cross-reactive T cell responses and the nuances of viral immunity. Fuâ€™s work contributes significantly to the understanding of immunogenomics, cellular dynamics in breast cancer, and the development of therapeutic interventions, thereby advancing the field of transplantation immunology and infectious disease response.
