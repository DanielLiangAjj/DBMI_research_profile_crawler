Researcher: Christopher Makinson
Research Overview:
Christopher Makinson's research focuses on the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying absence epilepsy and other seizure disorders, utilizing zebrafish and mouse models to explore the role of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically Na(v)1.1 and Na(v)1.6, in neuronal excitability and inhibitory processes. His work incorporates advanced techniques such as optogenetics and RNA interference to manipulate neuronal activity, and investigates the impact of pharmacological agents like ethosuximide and saxitoxin on seizure dynamics. By examining the interactions between pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons, as well as the influence of thalamocortical oscillations and thalamic inhibition, Makinson aims to elucidate the neurobiological underpinnings of absence seizures, brain rhythms, and related neurodevelopmental disorders. His research not only enhances the understanding of epilepsy mechanisms but also informs potential therapeutic avenues for managing these complex conditions.
