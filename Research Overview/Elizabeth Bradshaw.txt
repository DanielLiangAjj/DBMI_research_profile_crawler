Researcher: Elizabeth Bradshaw
Research Overview:
Elizabeth Bradshaw's research primarily focuses on the complexities of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and its interrelated mechanisms involving inflammation and neuroinflammation, with specific emphasis on the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and various neurobiological markers such as amyloid beta and tau proteins. Her work also explores the genetic factors influencing these conditions, including the implications of APOE and TREM2 genes on disease progression and prognosis. Additionally, Bradshaw has integrated biomechanics into her studies, examining how physical activities such as gymnastics and dance relate to risk factors for musculoskeletal injuries and chronic pain, particularly in younger populations. By utilizing advanced methodologies like multi-photon microscopy and biomechanical testing, her research aims to establish connections between physical movements, injury prevention, and neuromuscular health, making significant contributions to both the fields of neuroscience and sports medicine. Overall, her studies are pivotal in uncovering potential therapeutic targets and preventative strategies for neurodegeneration and injury in athletic contexts.
