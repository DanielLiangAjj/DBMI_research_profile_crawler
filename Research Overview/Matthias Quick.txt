Researcher: Matthias Quick
Research Overview:
Matthias Quick's research primarily focuses on the intersections of drug resistance in malaria, neurotransmitter transport mechanisms, and the structural biology of membrane proteins. His work on Plasmodium falciparum investigates the evolutionary dynamics of drug resistance, particularly related to the PfCRT protein and its implications for malaria treatment strategies. Concurrently, he explores the roles of various neurotransmitter transporters, such as dopamine and glutamate transporters, in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinsonâ€™s, employing advanced techniques like RNA sequencing and X-ray crystallography to elucidate their structural and functional properties. Quick's multidisciplinary approach, integrating molecular dynamics simulations with experimental biophysics, provides insights into conformational changes and allosteric regulation within transporters, offering new perspectives on their substrate recognition and transport kinetics. This comprehensive body of research contributes significantly to understanding both the biological mechanisms underlying drug resistance in pathogens and the neurobiological processes in the human brain, making strides in both malaria treatment and neurodegeneration.
