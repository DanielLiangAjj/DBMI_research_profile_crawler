Researcher: Ishmail Abdus-Saboor
Research Overview:
Ishmail Abdus-Saboor's research focuses on the interplay between animal behavior and neuroscience, particularly in the context of nociception, pain mechanisms, and sensory systems. Utilizing mouse models and advanced techniques such as optogenetics, high-speed videography, and machine learning, Abdus-Saboor investigates the molecular and neural circuits that underlie pain perception, tactile responses, and the reward pathways related to pleasure and analgesia. His work also touches on chromatin dynamics and nuclear architecture, exploring how epigenetic factors influence sensory neuron behavior and developmental biology. Additionally, he addresses broader societal issues, emphasizing diversity and equity in STEMM fields, while contributing insights into the biological basis of chronic pain and its management. Through a combination of behavioral assays and genomic analysis, Abdus-Saboor aims to elucidate the mechanisms of pain and somatosensation, advancing our understanding of these critical aspects of neuroscience.
