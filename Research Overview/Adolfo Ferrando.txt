Researcher: Adolfo Ferrando
Research Overview:
Adolfo Ferrando's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focused on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and peripheral T-cell lymphomas, with a strong emphasis on understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. His work integrates studies on the NOTCH signaling pathway, chromatin dynamics, and the role of specific oncogenes and transcription factors like GATA3, VAV1, and ETS1 in T-cell differentiation and leukemia progression. Ferrando employs various preclinical models, including murine models and organ-on-chip systems, to explore combination therapies that incorporate agents such as romidepsin, nelfinavir, and gamma-secretase inhibitors. His investigations into genetic variations, enhancer elements, and tumor microenvironments have further elucidated chemotherapy resistance mechanisms and provided insights into potential targeted therapies. Notably, his contributions to the understanding of the mTOR pathway and metabolic reprogramming in leukemia cells highlight the interplay between cellular metabolism and cancer biology. Overall, Ferrando's research strives to enhance the comprehension of T-cell malignancies, aiming to refine therapeutic strategies and improve patient outcomes in hematologic cancers.
