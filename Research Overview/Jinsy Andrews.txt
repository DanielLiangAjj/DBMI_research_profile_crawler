Researcher: Jinsy Andrews
Research Overview:
Dr. Jinsy Andrews has extensively researched amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and its associated genetic, clinical, and therapeutic dimensions. Her work encompasses various aspects of ALS, including genetic predisposition, disease progression, and the development and evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions such as reldesemtiv and tirasemtiv. She emphasizes the importance of personalized clinical trials and patient-reported outcome measures, with a focus on improving health-related quality of life and managing symptoms such as muscle cramps and respiratory insufficiency. Additionally, her research addresses clinical trial design, statistical analysis, and methods for harmonizing functional rating scales, contributing to the establishment of effective protocols for randomized controlled trials. Dr. Andrews' studies also highlight the impact of external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on the progression and management of ALS, while advocating for the integration of real-world data in clinical care. Overall, her contributions advance the understanding and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly ALS, through rigorous clinical research and innovative therapeutic strategies.
