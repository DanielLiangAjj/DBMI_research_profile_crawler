Researcher: Edward Owusu-Ansah
Research Overview:
Edward Owusu-Ansah's research primarily focuses on the molecular biology and genetics of Drosophila melanogaster, particularly in relation to mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). His investigations delve into the roles of mitochondrial complexes, such as complex I and complex III, in energy metabolism and their associations with diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s and type 2 diabetes. Using advanced methodologies including single particle cryo-electron microscopy and proteomics, he studies mitochondrial structure, lipid metabolism, and the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation. His work also encompasses the understanding of interorgan stress signaling and metabolic homeostasis, emphasizing the significance of mitochondrial integrity for insulin secretion and overall cellular respiration. Through employing model organisms and integrating various biological disciplines, Owusu-Ansah aims to unravel complex biological processes underlying metabolic diseases and mitochondrial dysfunction.
