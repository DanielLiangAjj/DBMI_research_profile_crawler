Researcher: Yiping W. Han
Research Overview:
Yiping W. Han's research predominantly explores the intricate relationships between specific bacterial pathogens, particularly *Fusobacterium nucleatum*, and significant health conditions, including colorectal cancer and pregnancy complications. A notable focus is placed on the role of inflammation and the mechanisms underlying bacterial virulence, as well as their contributions to disease pathogenesis. His work employs various methodologies, including PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing, to analyze microbiome dynamics and the implications of oral bacteria on systemic health, from adverse pregnancy outcomes like stillbirth and preterm birth to the promotion of colitis-associated cancers. The research consistently highlights the multifaceted interactions between the microbiome, inflammatory responses, and the development of chronic diseases, emphasizing the potential therapeutic targets within bacterial adhesins and their signaling pathways. Overall, Han's contributions significantly enhance our understanding of microbial influences on health, potentially guiding future clinical interventions and preventative strategies in both oncology and obstetrics.
