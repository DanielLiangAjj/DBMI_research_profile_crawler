Researcher: Stuart Firestein
Research Overview:
Stuart Firestein's research primarily focuses on the interplay between olfactory perception, anosmia, and regeneration mechanisms linked to stem cells within the context of COVID-19. His investigations delve into how the viral infection impacts the olfactory system, particularly the olfactory receptor neurons and the neurogenic processes occurring in the olfactory mucosa and piriform cortex. Additional themes in his work include the exploration of nuclear architecture, animal vocalization, and the aging process, which are pivotal to understanding olfactory renewal and proliferation. Firestein also studies various animal models, including mice and rats, and employs advanced techniques like single-cell analysis and microscopy to clarify the underlying biological mechanisms. Through this diverse yet interconnected array of topics, Firestein contributes to a deeper understanding of olfactory function, its disruptions due to viral infections, and the broader implications for sensory biology and regeneration.
