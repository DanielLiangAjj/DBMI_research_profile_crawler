Researcher: Neil Harrison
Research Overview:
Neil Harrison's research encompasses a wide-ranging exploration of the intricate relationships between inflammation, mental health, and neurobiology, particularly focusing on conditions such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and its neurobiological underpinnings. His work elucidates the roles of biomarkers like C-reactive protein and cytokines in the bidirectional interactions between neuroinflammatory processes and psychological disorders, emphasizing factors such as sex differences and hormonal influences. Harrison employs advanced imaging techniques, including diffusion MRI and resting-state fMRI, to investigate the structural and functional connectivity of brain regions associated with emotional regulation, cognitive function, and behavioral performance. Moreover, his interdisciplinary approach extends to examining the implications of psychosocial factors, such as psychological safety in educational contexts and the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, positioning his research at the forefront of contemporary neuroscience and psychiatry. Ultimately, Harrison's contributions aim to enhance our understanding of how neuroimmune interactions shape mental health trajectories and the broader implications for treatment strategies in psychiatric disorders.
