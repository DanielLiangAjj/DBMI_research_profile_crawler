Researcher: Kristin Baldwin
Research Overview:
Kristin Baldwin's research primarily focuses on the complex interplay between pluripotent stem cells, neurodegeneration, and the development of advanced disease models through innovative techniques such as gene editing and blastocyst complementation. Her studies emphasize brain evolution and regeneration, exploring how induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be utilized for modeling genetic diseases such as Friedreich ataxia, and for investigating neuronal diversity and circuit formation in various animal models. A significant aspect of her work examines the role of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in the context of both neural and cardiovascular diseases, aiming to enhance our understanding of cellular mechanisms involved in synaptic transmission and trans-synaptic interactions. By integrating transcriptomics and advanced cellular reprogramming techniques, her research seeks to unravel the genetic and epigenetic factors influencing neuronal function and health, contributing to regenerative medicine and therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.
