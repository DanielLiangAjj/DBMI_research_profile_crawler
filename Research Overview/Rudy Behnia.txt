Researcher: Rudy Behnia
Research Overview:
Rudy Behnia's research primarily focuses on the intricate mechanisms of visual processing in *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruit flies), emphasizing the interrelation of color perception, motion detection, and neural circuit dynamics. His work extensively explores various aspects of vision, including color management, color space, and color opponency, as well as the nonlinear optimization of visual stimuli in relation to the physiological adaptations that occur within the visual pathways. Moreover, Behnia investigates neural structures such as the connectome, ON/OFF pathways, and photoreceptors, revealing how these components contribute to direction selectivity and overall motion vision. He employs advanced techniques like calcium imaging and two-photon microscopy to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity influenced by neuromodulators such as octopamine. Through his research, Behnia aims to elucidate the evolutionary adaptations of visual systems, underscoring the role of state dependence and temporal filters in sensory processing, with broader implications for understanding visual perception across different species.
