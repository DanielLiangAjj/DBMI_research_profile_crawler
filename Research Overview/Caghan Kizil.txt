Researcher: Caghan Kizil
Research Overview:
Caghan Kizil's research primarily focuses on the pathophysiology and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, emphasizing the interplay between various cellular mechanisms, including neuroinflammation, tau and amyloid pathology, and synaptic degeneration. Through innovative approaches involving multi-target drugs and high-throughput screening, Kizil explores therapeutic strategies and disease-modifying treatments aimed at addressing the complex nature of Alzheimer's. His work integrates advanced techniques such as single-cell and transcriptomic analyses, leveraging model organisms like zebrafish and human-derived stem cells to investigate neurogenesis, regeneration, and the underlying genetic factors contributing to disease susceptibility. By investigating neuroimmune interactions and epigenetic modifications, Kizil's research strives to illuminate the intricacies of neurodegenerative processes and pave the way for the development of effective therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, his contributions provide crucial insights into progressing drug development and understanding the mechanisms that drive Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies.
