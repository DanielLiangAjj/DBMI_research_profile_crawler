Researcher: Rushelle Byfield
Research Overview:
Rushelle Byfield's research is centered on the intersection of biomedical informatics and cardiovascular health, with a particular focus on pediatric populations. Her work examines vital issues such as blood pressure regulation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease within youths, utilizing electronic health records and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to gather data. Byfield emphasizes causal inference and the life course approach in understanding the adherence to treatment regimes, including the use of antihypertensive agents. Her studies also explore the implications of left ventricular mass and renal function, contributing valuable insights into the management of cardiovascular health from childhood through adolescence. Overall, Byfield's research aims to improve health outcomes by addressing chronic conditions and advancing our understanding of the biomarkers and treatment adherence related to blood pressure in young patients.
