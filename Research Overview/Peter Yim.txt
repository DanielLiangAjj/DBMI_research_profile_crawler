Researcher: Peter Yim
Research Overview:
Peter Yim's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focused on the intersections of gastroenterology, neurology, and cardiovascular health, particularly in the context of COVID-19. His studies delve into the mechanisms of coagulopathy and fibrinolysis, exploring biomarkers such as PAI-1 and vWF, while also investigating the impacts of sex hormones and neuronal factors on gastrointestinal motility and conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Yim's work extends to understanding smooth muscle relaxation mechanisms, particularly regarding tocolytic agents in the uterus and airway, leveraging the roles of opsins and GABA signaling pathways. Furthermore, his research includes significant insights into the complications arising from congenital heart disease, particularly post-Fontan procedure, and the role of thromboembolism in this patient population. This comprehensive investigation into physiological and pathological processes illustrates Yim's dedication to enhancing clinical outcomes through an integrated approach to neuroendocrine regulation, coagulation disorders, and smooth muscle function.
