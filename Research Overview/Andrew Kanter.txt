Researcher: Andrew Kanter
Research Overview:
Andrew Kanter's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily focused on healthcare innovation and data analysis, particularly in the context of global health challenges such as COVID-19, Ebola, and malaria. His work emphasizes the use of biological therapy, electronic health records (EHR), and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance the credibility and reproducibility of epidemiological data. Kanter is deeply invested in promoting open science practices, advocating for collaborative analytics, and developing clinical data models that harmonize information across various platforms. His research addresses the importance of community health workers and mobile health (mHealth) interventions in sub-Saharan Africa, examining the usability of health information systems and telecommunications technologies to improve healthcare delivery. Through text mining and named entity recognition, he explores the role of observational data in understanding disease outbreaks, aiming to build capacity and efficiency within health services. Overall, Andrew Kanter's work aims to leverage technology and data science to improve public health outcomes, particularly in resource-limited settings.
