Researcher: Alexis Walker
Research Overview:
Alexis Walker’s research focuses on the intersection of health care equity, genetics, and social determinants of health, particularly in relation to Alzheimer’s disease and other cognitive impairments among diverse populations. Investigating themes such as dementia, race and racism, and bioethics, Walker explores how these factors contribute to disparities in health outcomes and access to care. The use of advanced methodologies like artificial intelligence and big data analytics underpins the research, which emphasizes the importance of genomics and biomarker discovery in understanding aging and functional decline in older adults. Additionally, Walker's inquiry extends to global health issues, involving economic considerations, health policy, and the ethics surrounding personal genetic information, advocating for social justice and responsibility in health care allocation. Through a multifaceted approach that includes perspectives from anthropology, finance, and public health, Walker aims to contribute to a more equitable health care system and advance the understanding of disease mechanisms while addressing the ethical implications of emerging genomic technologies.
