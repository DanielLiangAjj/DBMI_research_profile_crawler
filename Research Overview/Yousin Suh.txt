Researcher: Yousin Suh
Research Overview:
Yousin Suh's research encompasses a comprehensive exploration of aging, neurodegeneration, and genetic factors associated with longevity and various age-related diseases. Utilizing a systems biology approach, Suh integrates molecular genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics to investigate the roles of various non-coding RNAs, including circRNA, lncRNA, miRNA, and targets within chromatin organization and gene regulation. The researcher employs innovative methodologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and advanced sequencing technologies to uncover genetic variants that contribute to aging, notably in models like *C. elegans* and human centenarians. Suh's work further extends to the intersection of aging and disease, including Alzheimer's and cancer, emphasizing the implications of genomic instability and somatic mutations. Additionally, the influence of interventions, including dietary restrictions and pharmaceutical agents like rapamycin, on healthspan and longevity remains a pivotal focus. Overall, Suh's significant contributions provide deep insights into the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of aging, offering promising avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at promoting healthy aging and mitigating age-related diseases.
