Researcher: Adam Mor
Research Overview:
Adam Mor's research focuses on the interplay between immune checkpoints, particularly the Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) pathway, and various autoimmune conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis. His studies delve into the roles of T follicular helper and peripheral helper cells, as well as the influence of immune checkpoint inhibitors like Ipilimumab and Nivolumab on T-cell activation and proliferation. Significant emphasis is placed on understanding how these mechanisms contribute to autoimmune responses and conditions, exploring the genetic and signaling pathways involved, including the roles of proteins such as SHP2, SAP, and CTLA-4 in immune tolerance and activation. Utilizing advanced techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing and phosphoproteomics, Mor aims to identify potential biomarkers for autoimmune diseases and immune-related adverse events associated with immunotherapy. Collectively, his research seeks to elucidate the complex signaling networks governing T-cell biology and their implications for both cancer treatment and the management of autoimmune disorders.
