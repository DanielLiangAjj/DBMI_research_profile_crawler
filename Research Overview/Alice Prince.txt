Researcher: Alice Prince
Research Overview:
Alice Prince's research focuses on critical aspects of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Her work explores the complex interplay between antimicrobial resistance mechanisms—including carbapenem and colistin resistance—and the host immune response. By examining immunometabolic processes, such as the roles of itaconate and succinate in inflammation and infection, she investigates how metabolic adaptations in both pathogens and host cells affect disease outcomes, including pneumonia and chronic infections, particularly in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Through the use of various animal models and advanced cellular techniques, Prince aims to unravel the mechanisms of immune evasion, pathogen adaptation, and the host-pathogen interactions that contribute to persistent infections and disease tolerance. Her research ultimately seeks to inform better therapeutic strategies and the development of vaccines to combat resistant bacterial infections.
