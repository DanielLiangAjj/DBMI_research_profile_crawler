Researcher: Michael M. Shen
Research Overview:
Michael M. Shen's research primarily focuses on the complexities of prostate cancer, particularly exploring the mechanisms of tumor heterogeneity, plasticity, stemness, and drug resistance. His studies employ advanced methodologies like single-cell transcriptomics and genomic profiling to dissect the role of transcription factors, epigenetic regulation, and various signaling pathways, including Wnt and TGF-Î², in cancer progression and the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Shen's work highlights the importance of lineage tracing and cellular reprogramming, aiming to uncover the interactions within tumor microenvironments and their impact on cancer stem cells and progenitor cells. Additionally, he examines the potential of organoids and genetically engineered mouse models to provide insights into therapeutic responses and tumor evolution. Collectively, his research contributes significantly to our understanding of prostate cancer biology and offers potential avenues for precision medicine and novel treatment strategies.
