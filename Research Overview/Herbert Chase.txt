Researcher: Herbert Chase
Research Overview:
Herbert Chase's research intersects multiple domains, prominently featuring advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning and natural language processing, and their applications in healthcare, notably within oncology and geriatrics. His work extensively examines the interplay of machine learning techniques in analyzing electronic health records (EHR), enhancing the prediction and management of adverse drug events (ADEs), drug-drug interactions (DDIs), and polypharmacy risks, especially among older populations experiencing conditions like delirium, dementia, and chronic diseases. Through retrospective and cohort studies, he investigates the factors influencing prescribing patterns, diagnostic accuracy, and healthcare quality control, addressing critical issues such as the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare practices. Additionally, his exploration of algorithms and data mining contributes to improving patient safety and treatment outcomes by leveraging health informatics. Chase's prolific contributions reflect a holistic approach to integrating artificial intelligence in enhancing clinical decision-making and optimizing patient care pathways.
