Researcher: Iva Greenwald
Research Overview:
Iva Greenwald's research culminates in an intricate understanding of cellular mechanisms governing development and cell fate specification in *Caenorhabditis elegans*, focusing particularly on the roles of signaling pathways and transcription factors. Utilizing a range of methodologies, including biosensing techniques and genetic manipulation, her work explores critical processes such as vulval development, germline dynamics, and the interplay of Notch and EGF receptor signaling in gonadogenesis and sexual dimorphism. The involvement of diverse molecular players, like DAF-18 (PTEN), ERK, and bHLH transcription factors, highlights the regulatory networks and feedback mechanisms necessary for proper cell fate determination and migration. Furthermore, her investigations into the evolutionary aspects of these signaling pathways reveal deep phylogenetic connections, paving the way for enhanced insights into developmental biology that also potentially influence broader implications in human genomics and disease. Greenwald's contributions not only enrich the foundational knowledge of *C. elegans* biology but also lay critical groundwork for understanding similar processes in higher organisms.
