Researcher: Jay Gingrich
Research Overview:
Jay Gingrich's research primarily focuses on the complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors in the context of mood disorders, particularly depression and anxiety. His work extensively investigates the effects of prenatal exposure to antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), on infant neurodevelopment, emphasizing the potential for intergenerational transmission of depressive and anxiety disorders. Utilizing various advanced neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI and structural MRI, his studies explore alterations in the brain networks involved in emotion regulation, particularly within the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, while also assessing the implications of gene expression related to serotonin receptors. Furthermore, his research incorporates longitudinal designs to establish causal links and risk factors associated with depressive disorders in different cohorts, including pregnant mothers and their offspring. Through a combination of animal models and human studies, he aims to elucidate critical developmental pathways that could inform therapeutic approaches for mood disorders and improve outcomes for at-risk populations.
