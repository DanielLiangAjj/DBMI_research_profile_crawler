Researcher: Itsik Pe'er
Research Overview:
Itsik Pe'er's research primarily focuses on the intersection of genetic variation, mental health disorders, and microbiome analysis, particularly within founder populations. With an emphasis on rare variants associated with schizophrenia, Pe'er employs advanced methodologies such as whole exome and whole genome sequencing, as well as metagenomics, including shotgun sequencing and 16S rRNA sequencing, to explore the complex relationships between genetic predispositions and microbial communities. His work examines population structures and seeks to understand the temporal dynamics, employing longitudinal and time-series studies to elucidate these correlations. Additionally, Pe'erâ€™s research leverages statistical models and algorithms to analyze genetic data and offers insights into the population genetics of unique demographic groups, particularly Jewish populations in Europe and the Middle East. Overall, Pe'er contributes significantly to our understanding of how genetic and microbial factors interact in health and disease.
