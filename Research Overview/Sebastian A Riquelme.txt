Researcher: Sebastian A Riquelme
Research Overview:
Sebastian A. Riquelme's research predominantly focuses on the pathogenesis and immunological response associated with chronic bacterial infections, particularly in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) and other respiratory diseases. His studies delve into the dynamics of biofilm formation by pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, examining mechanisms of antibiotic tolerance and immune evasion. Additionally, Riquelme investigates the immunometabolic responses of macrophages and neutrophils, exploring how factors like itaconate and succinate influence inflammation and cellular metabolism during infection. His work also encompasses the impact of effective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies, as well as the metabolic adaptations of bacteria in response to host-induced stress. Furthermore, he addresses the interplay between oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, and immune modulation in respiratory pathologies, overall contributing significant insights into the host-pathogen interactions that underpin chronic pulmonary infections.
