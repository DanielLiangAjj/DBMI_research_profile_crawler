Researcher: Lauren Richter
Research Overview:
Lauren Richter's research is focused on the intersection of health equity, electronic health records, and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on ensuring causal fairness in healthcare applications. Her work examines critical topics such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes management, and obesity, addressing their implications within diverse populations while aiming to reduce healthcare disparities. Richter also explores the role of environmental factors and emerging contaminants, particularly per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), in public health issues, including cancer prevention and risk assessment. Through community-based participatory research and studies on environmental justice, she aims to enhance public health policies and practices, integrating social determinants of health into clinical decision-making. This amalgamation of healthcare, environmental health, and ethical considerations underscores her commitment to improving outcomes and promoting health equity across various demographics.
