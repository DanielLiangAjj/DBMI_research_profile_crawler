Researcher: Krystalyn Hudson
Research Overview:
Dr. Krystalyn Hudson's research centers around the immunological dynamics and physiological responses associated with red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets, employing mouse models to investigate various associated pathologies. Her work highlights the intricate mechanisms of platelet activation, aggregation, and storage, particularly in the context of transfusion medicine and complications arising from conditions like autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia. In addition to studying the effects of transfusions and storage lesions on RBC deformability and oxidative stress, her research also encompasses the implications of dietary influences such as fish oil on lipid peroxidation and overall blood health. Dr. Hudson explores the interactions of immune responses mediated by antibodies and complements, particularly during COVID-19, shedding light on alloimmunization phenomena and the role of specific immune cells like regulatory T cells and dendritic cells in maintaining tolerance. Overall, her findings contribute to advancing our understanding of the immuno-hematological landscape, with significant implications for improving transfusion strategies and managing autoimmune conditions.
