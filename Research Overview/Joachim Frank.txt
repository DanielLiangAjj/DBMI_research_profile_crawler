Researcher: Joachim Frank
Research Overview:
Joachim Frank's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focused on ribosomes, their structure, function, and dynamics, primarily using advanced techniques like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and microfluidics. His work notably investigates the intricacies of translation processes involving various ribosomal proteins, including bS21, uS2, and eS1, as well as the understanding of leaderless transcripts and short-lived intermediates during translation initiation and elongation in organisms such as *E. coli* and yeast. Additionally, Frank's research contributes to the knowledge of calcium handling in cellular systems, addressing its implications in cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, using models derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. His application of time-resolved cryo-EM techniques facilitates insights into ribosome recycling and the interplay between the structural configurations of ribosomal complexes and their molecular dynamics. Ultimately, Frankâ€™s work harnesses machine learning methods and sophisticated imaging techniques to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying protein biosynthesis and disease-related cellular functions, reinforcing the critical link between structural biology and quantitative analysis in understanding complex biological systems.
