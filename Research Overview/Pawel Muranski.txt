Researcher: Pawel Muranski
Research Overview:
Pawel Muranski's research predominantly focuses on the interplay of viral infections, cellular immunity, and immunotherapy, particularly in the context of immunocompromised patients such as those undergoing solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants. His work is deeply rooted in understanding various viruses, including BK, JC, cytomegalovirus, and SARS-CoV-2, and their effects on cellular immunity. Through extensive studies, he explores the immunogenic responses facilitated by virus-specific T cells, highlighting the relevance of these cellular responses in combating viral infections and managing post-transplant complications. Additionally, his investigations into adoptive cellular therapy, including CAR T cell and donor lymphocyte infusion therapies, underscore advancements in cancer treatment, demonstrating how immune profiling can influence therapeutic strategies. Muranski's contributions extend to analyzing the implications of COVID-19 vaccines and the immune responses in kidney and other organ transplant recipients, aiming to inform pre-emptive therapy strategies and promote patient outcomes in viral reactivation and cancer relapses. Overall, his research bridges viral pathogenesis, immunology, and therapeutic interventions, emphasizing the vital role of immune modulation in managing complex patient populations.
