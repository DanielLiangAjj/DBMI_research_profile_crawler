Researcher: Livio Pellizzoni
Research Overview:
Livio Pellizzoni's research primarily focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons. His work investigates the complex interplay of factors related to cell proliferation, lipid homeostasis, and endoplasmic reticulum function, particularly through proteins such as the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) and phospholipid scramblases. By utilizing various experimental models, including mice and cellular systems, he explores the roles of distinct ribonucleoprotein complexes and RNA processing in SMA pathogenesis. His studies also delve into neuroprotective strategies and therapeutic approaches, including the application of antisense oligonucleotides like nusinersen and the investigation of compounds like 4-phenylbutyrate to enhance motor neuron survival and function. Pellizzoni's research contributes valuable insights into potential interventions for SMA and other neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the critical role of RNA metabolism and cellular signaling pathways in maintaining neuronal health.
