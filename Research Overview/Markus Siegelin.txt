Researcher: Markus Siegelin
Research Overview:
Markus Siegelin's research primarily focuses on uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying brain cancers, specifically glioblastoma and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). His work involves exploring various apoptotic pathways and metabolic reprogramming, highlighting key proteins like ATF5, CEBPB, CEBPD, and TXNIP, which play significant roles in cell survival, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. Utilizing advanced techniques such as single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), Siegelin's team aims to model diseases and unveil the tumor microenvironment's influence on cancer progression. Additionally, his investigations on drug repurposing and combination therapies target metabolic pathways in glioblastoma to enhance treatment efficacy and address multi-drug resistance. His comprehensive approach integrates genetic, proteomic, and metabolic analyses, contributing valuable insights toward novel therapeutic strategies in oncology, particularly for brain tumors.
