Researcher: Shirley ShiDu Yan
Research Overview:
Shirley ShiDu Yan’s research primarily focuses on elucidating the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders, particularly the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in cognitive decline and synaptic impairment. A significant portion of her work involves investigating the effects of amyloid beta peptides, with a keen interest in cyclophilin D inhibitors and their potential in modulating mitochondrial pathways. Her studies leverage diverse methodologies, including in vivo imaging, high-throughput screening, and the use of various model systems such as transgenic mice and cybrid cells, to assess neuronal plasticity, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitophagy. Additionally, her research into advanced glycation end products (AGEs) highlights the intersection of aging, neuroinflammation, and metabolic dysregulation in Alzheimer’s pathology. Overall, her findings aim to contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic deficits, and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease and potentially other related neurodegenerative conditions.
