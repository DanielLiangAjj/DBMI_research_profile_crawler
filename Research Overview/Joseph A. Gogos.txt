Researcher: Joseph A. Gogos
Research Overview:
Joseph A. Gogos's research primarily focuses on understanding the complex interactions between brain development, genetics, and neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia. His studies encompass various facets of neuronal function, including interneuron dynamics, synaptic plasticity, and the roles of specific genes such as Setd1a and MEF2 in cognitive processes. Utilizing animal models, especially transgenic mice, Gogos explores the molecular underpinnings of cognitive deficits associated with genetic variations, notably the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome linked to schizophrenia. His work integrates developmental biology and neuroscience, investigating how disruptions in neural circuits and neurotransmitter systems contribute to psychiatric diseases. By employing techniques like two-photon microscopy and calcium imaging, he examines the oscillatory patterns and connectivity within the cortex that are essential for functions such as working memory and perception. Furthermore, his research endeavors to identify potential therapeutic targets and pharmacological interventions for enhancing cognitive function in individuals affected by schizophrenia and related disorders, paving the way for improved treatments based on genetic and environmental interactions.
