Researcher: Ya Cheng Liao
Research Overview:
Ya Cheng Liao's research is centered around the intricate interplay between lysosomes, peroxisomes, and cellular stress responses in the context of various neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. Key themes include the role of ALG2 and COPII in ER exit sites and their connections to endosomal sorting complexes, highlighting critical pathways involved in protein transport and membrane dynamics. The research delves into aspects of autophagy, specifically how cellular mechanisms respond to stress via lysosome function and the implications of cholesterol transport within this system, particularly in relation to adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, investigations into mTOR signaling and calcium-binding proteins underscored the regulatory effects of organelle contact sites on lipid metabolism and RNA transport processes. Through advanced methodologies like FIB-SEM and in vitro reconstitution assays, Liao's work illuminates the fundamental biological transport mechanisms that underpin health and disease, painting a complex picture of organelle interactions and their significance in cellular physiology.
