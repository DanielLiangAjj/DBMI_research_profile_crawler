Researcher: Krzysztof Kiryluk
Research Overview:
Krzysztof Kiryluk's research focuses on the intersection of genomics and kidney disease, particularly as it relates to personalized and precision medicine approaches in kidney transplantation and chronic kidney disease (CKD). His work involves sophisticated methodologies such as exome and genome sequencing, bioinformatic pipelines, and the development of polygenic risk scores (PRS) to better understand genetic predispositions and the mechanisms underlying various renal conditions, including IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Additionally, Kiryluk emphasizes the importance of health equity and the return of actionable genetic findings to diverse populations, advocating for the use of electronic health records to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. His contributions to translational genomic efforts aim to identify genetic variants associated with renal disease progression and treatment response, thereby enhancing diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic strategies in nephrology. Overall, his research underscores the potential for genomic insights to drive advancements in kidney disease management and public health, bridging the gap between laboratory findings and clinical applications.
