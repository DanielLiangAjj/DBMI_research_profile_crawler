Researcher: Joriene De Nooij
Research Overview:
Joriene De Nooij's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms underlying proprioception, the sensory perception of body position and movement, particularly examining the roles of various sensory receptor cells such as Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles. Through a combination of molecular biology, neuronal development, and sensory neuron studies in mice, her work delves into topics like cellular diversity, gene regulation, and the impact of extrinsic signaling molecules on proprioceptive sensory neurons. By investigating glutamate receptors, including GluK2 and metabotropic glutamate receptors, she explores how mechanosensation and the cellular identity of neuronal populations contribute to sensory-motor control. Additionally, her studies encompass the effects of noncoding DNA, chromatin interactions, and developmental transcription factors like Isl1 and Lhx3 on the fate specification of proprioceptors. De Nooij's comprehensive exploration aims to enhance our understanding of neuromuscular interfaces, signaling pathways, and their implications for developing advanced bionic systems and improving sensory feedback mechanisms in prosthetic limbs.
