Researcher: Lawrence Lenke
Research Overview:
Lawrence Lenke's research predominantly focuses on spinal deformities, particularly in the context of pediatric and adult spinal deformity surgery. His work extensively utilizes concepts from artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive modeling to improve surgical outcomes and enhance patient-reported quality of life. Lenke's studies cover a wide array of topics including idiopathic scoliosis, kyphosis, surgical techniques like vertebral column resection and osteotomy, as well as comprehensive analysis of postoperative complications, effective pain management strategies, and rehabilitation outcomes. A significant emphasis is placed on understanding the impact of radiographic parameters on spinal alignment and balance, as well as the implications of various surgical interventions on health-related quality of life. Through systematic reviews, clinical trials, and innovative methodologies such as 3D printing and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, Lenke contributes to advancing orthopedic surgery practices, addressing complications, and fostering best practice guidelines grounded in ethical considerations. His research not only enhances the technical aspects of spinal surgery but also prioritizes patient-centric approaches, ultimately aiming to improve the overall effectiveness of spinal deformity treatment.
