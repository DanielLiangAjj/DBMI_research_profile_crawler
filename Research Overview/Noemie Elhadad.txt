Researcher: Noemie Elhadad
Research Overview:
Noemie Elhadad's research significantly focuses on the intersection of health informatics, machine learning, and health equity, exploring how technological advancements can improve healthcare delivery and decision-making processes. Her work emphasizes the importance of electronic health records (EHR) in tracking disparities and informing better health outcomes, particularly for marginalized populations affected by infectious diseases, mental health challenges, and chronic conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. Through the application of natural language processing and deep learning, she investigates the potential of utilizing patient-generated health data and emerging technologies such as chatbots and mobile applications to enhance patient self-management and support systems. Elhadad's analysis of health inequities, combined with her expertise in data science and bioinformatics, aims to establish ethical frameworks that ensure fairness in health interventions and contribute to improved care coordination and management across various demographic groups. Overall, her contributions are poised to drive innovations in public health informatics, promote health equity, and enhance clinical decision-making using data-driven methodologies.
