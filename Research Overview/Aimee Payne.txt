Researcher: Aimee Payne
Research Overview:
Aimee Payne's research focuses on various aspects of autoimmunity, particularly the role of immune cells such as B cells and T cells in autoimmune diseases, including lupus, multiple sclerosis, pemphigus vulgaris, and rheumatoid arthritis. Her work extensively investigates the interactions between the immune system and microbiota, exploring how bacterial viability and specific microbial species, such as *Cutibacterium acnes* and *E. coli*, influence autoimmunity. Furthermore, her studies delve into therapies such as CAR T cell therapy and B cell depletion therapies, notably the use of monoclonal antibodies like rituximab and obinutuzumab, to manage autoimmune conditions. She utilizes innovative techniques, including next generation sequencing and detailed immunohistochemistry, to evaluate autoantibody production, immunologic memory, and cytokine responses. Through her scoping reviews and clinical trials, Payne aims to enhance the understanding of treatment outcomes and the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in autoimmune disorders, thereby contributing to the advancement of biologic therapy and improving patient care in immunology and dermatology.
