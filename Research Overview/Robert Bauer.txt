Researcher: Robert Bauer
Research Overview:
Robert Bauer's research encompasses a wide array of themes primarily focused on cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, and cognitive decline, with particular attention to the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions. His work integrates studies on long non-coding RNAs, such as HuR and IGF2BP2, that play critical roles in cellular metabolism and gene regulation related to obesity and atherosclerosis. Bauer utilizes advanced methodologies, including single-cell analysis, transcriptomics, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, to investigate the relationships between inflammation, lipid metabolism, and chronic illnesses like coronary artery disease and Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, his research incorporates technological advancements in 3D printing and deep learning to improve therapeutic delivery systems and neurorehabilitation strategies. Through genome-wide association studies and comparisons of genetic predispositions, he aims to elucidate the intricate biological interactions that contribute to disease progression, offering insights that may inform future treatments and health interventions.
