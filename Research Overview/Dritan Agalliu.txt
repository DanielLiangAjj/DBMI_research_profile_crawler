Researcher: Dritan Agalliu
Research Overview:
Dritan Agalliu's research focuses on the mechanisms governing the blood-brain and blood-retinal barriers, particularly in relation to neuroinflammation, angiogenesis, and various neurological disorders. He investigates the roles of Müller glia and endothelial cells in maintaining barrier integrity through pathways such as Norrin/β-catenin signaling and the expression of tight junction proteins like Claudin-5 and Occludin. The interplay between neuronal activity and glial cells in the context of pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases like pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, is a significant aspect of his work. By employing techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing and employing animal models, Agalliu explores the effects of immune responses, cytokines, and host-pathogen interactions on barrier function and associated neurovascular development. This comprehensive approach aims to unravel the complexities of the neurovascular unit and contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms, ultimately informing therapeutic strategies for managing neurological conditions.
