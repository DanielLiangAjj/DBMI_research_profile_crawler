Researcher: Aaron Viny
Research Overview:
Aaron Viny's research primarily focuses on the genetic and epigenetic factors underlying myeloid malignancies, particularly Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and associated disorders such as Myelodysplastic Syndromes. His work explores the role of chromatin architecture, with a specific emphasis on the function of chromosomal proteins like cohesins, transcription factors, and the influence of mutations within key genes such as TET2. Utilizing mouse models and advanced techniques like Hi-C and RNA sequencing, Viny investigates how alterations in nuclear topology and gene expression regulation contribute to hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and the development of hematologic neoplasms. Additionally, he addresses disparities in survival rates among different demographic groups, particularly in pediatric and adolescent populations, highlighting the importance of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Through his work, Viny aims to enhance the understanding of leukemia and lymphoma pathogenesis, ultimately contributing to improved diagnosis, treatment outcomes, and precision medicine approaches for affected individuals.
