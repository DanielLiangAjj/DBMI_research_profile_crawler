Researcher: Lei Ding
Research Overview:
Lei Ding's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on the intersection of environmental pollutants, health outcomes, and treatment methodologies across various diseases. His work includes investigations into the impacts of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, and mercury on human health, particularly concerning cardiometabolic diseases, cancer, and chronic conditions. He has conducted extensive meta-analyses to assess risk factors and treatment outcomes, particularly in the context of colorectal cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Ding also explores advanced therapeutic techniques, including the use of electrochemical methods for wastewater remediation and the development of nanoparticles for drug delivery and cancer therapy. Additionally, his studies investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying disease processes, particularly involving apoptosis, angiogenesis, and the tumor microenvironment, contributing to enhanced understanding and improved therapeutic strategies in oncology, cardiology, and chronic disease management. Overall, Ding's research significantly contributes to the fields of environmental health, cancer biology, and regenerative medicine, promoting a comprehensive understanding of how environmental factors influence health and disease progression.
