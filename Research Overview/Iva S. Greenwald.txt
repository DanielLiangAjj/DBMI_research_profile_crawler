Researcher: Iva S. Greenwald
Research Overview:
Iva S. Greenwald's research primarily focuses on the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying cell fate determination and development in *Caenorhabditis elegans* (C. elegans). Utilizing this model organism, Greenwald explores the roles of various signaling pathways, such as the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Notch signaling, in processes like vulval development, gonadogenesis, and quiescence. The researcher investigates the influence of key proteins, including bHLH transcription factors, ADAM proteases, and various kinase signaling cascades like Raf-MEK-ERK, on cellular differentiation and lineage specification. Additionally, studies of the genetic interactions involving DAF-18 (PTEN) signal a link between environmental adaptation and developmental pathways, emphasizing evolutionary aspects as well. Through biosensor technologies and advanced genetic manipulation techniques, Greenwald seeks to elucidate the intricate gene regulatory networks that drive the stochastic nature of cell fates and organ development. As a whole, the body of work contributes significantly to understanding how molecular interactions and cellular decisions are orchestrated during development and how similar mechanisms might be conserved across species.
