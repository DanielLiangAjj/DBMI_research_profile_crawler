Researcher: Richard Paul Mayeux
Research Overview:
Richard Paul Mayeux's research primarily focuses on Alzheimer's disease and its various genetic, environmental, and physiological factors. The body of work encompasses a wide range of topics, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the role of genetic risk factors like apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes, and the impact of comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes on cognitive decline. His studies utilize multi-omics approaches, integrating proteomics and transcriptomics, and frequently employ advanced techniques like mass spectrometry and whole-genome sequencing. Mayeux's research also delves into sex differences in cognitive aging, the effects of lifestyle factors such as physical activity and diet on dementia risk, and the relationship between neuroinflammation, amyloid pathology, and cognitive impairment. Significant attention is given to health disparities among diverse populations, including ethnic and socioeconomic factors that influence the prevalence and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Overall, Mayeux’s work contributes to our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease, aiming to enhance precision medicine strategies for prevention and treatment based on genetic and environmental risk profiles.
