Researcher: Brent Stockwell
Research Overview:
Brent Stockwell's research primarily revolves around the mechanisms of ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation and iron metabolism, particularly in the context of cancer and neurodegeneration. His work explores the interplay between ferroptosis and various cellular functions, such as apoptosis and necroptosis, highlighting the roles of signaling pathways and metabolic processes involving reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione, and specific enzymes like GPX4. Stockwell examines the implications of ferroptosis in cancer therapeutics, including the potential for immune checkpoint blockade and the influence of metabolic factors on tumor dynamics. Additionally, his research delves into proteomics, mass spectrometry imaging, and the development of small molecules that may serve as therapeutic agents for diseases such as neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and liver carcinomas. His extensive investigation into the lipid peroxidation pathways and iron-related cell death mechanisms positions Stockwell's work at the forefront of cancer research and therapeutic discovery.
