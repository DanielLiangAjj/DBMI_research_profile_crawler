Researcher: Elizabeth Hillman
Research Overview:
Elizabeth Hillman's research focuses on a diverse range of topics within neuroscience, particularly exploring the functional connectivity and dynamics of neural circuits using various model organisms such as Drosophila, zebrafish, and mice. Her work emphasizes the integration of advanced techniques including calcium imaging, wide-field optical mapping, and ex vivo neuroimaging to investigate motor circuits, nociception, and neurovascular coupling. Hillman employs a multimodal approach incorporating optical imaging and deep learning to assess brain states, hemodynamics, and neural activity dynamics. Additionally, she addresses the biological implications of her findings in the context of neurological disorders, developmental processes, and the underlying mechanisms of diseases such as glioma and Alzheimer's. Overall, her research aims to elucidate the complexity of neuronal interactions and how they contribute to behavior, with a significant focus on postnatal neural development and the physiological correlates of brain function.
