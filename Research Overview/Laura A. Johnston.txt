Researcher: Laura A. Johnston
Research Overview:
Laura A. Johnston's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of cell competition, particularly through the lens of the Drosophila model system. Her work investigates how various signaling modules, including JNK and TNF, influence competitive interactions among cells, particularly in the epithelium and during neurodevelopment. This includes examining "loser signatures" in neural progenitor cells and how mutations, such as those in NimC1, affect brain size and development. Employing techniques like clonal analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing, Johnston explores the roles of tumor suppressor proteins like Trp53 and oncogenes like Myc in regulating cell death, proliferation, and the balance between healthy and potentially neoplastic growth. Her findings reveal vital insights into the signaling pathways and genetic interactions that underpin tissue homeostasis and response to stressors, contributing to our understanding of cancer biology and regenerative processes. Overall, Johnston's research exemplifies a commitment to uncovering the fundamental principles of cell communication and competition, with implications for developmental biology and oncology.
