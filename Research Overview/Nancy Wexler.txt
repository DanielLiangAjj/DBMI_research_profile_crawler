Researcher: Nancy Wexler
Research Overview:
Nancy Wexler's research primarily focuses on the integration of community health workers within health systems, emphasizing their roles in recruitment and retention strategies to enhance public health outcomes. Her work spans the epidemiological and genetic dimensions of Huntington’s disease, aiming to unravel the complexities associated with the HTT gene, particularly exon 1 variations and their relationships to disease phenotypes. She investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying mis-splicing events of huntingtin fragments and the implications of mutations on protein aggregation and disease progression. Furthermore, Wexler’s research engages in exploring familial health dynamics, gene-environment interactions, and the utilization of advanced genomic techniques like whole genome sequencing. Her contributions extend to understanding the prevalence and incidence of Huntington’s disease across diverse populations, particularly in regions like Venezuela and the United States. By intertwining genetic research with public health concerns, her work seeks to illuminate pathways towards precision medicine and improved health care delivery for affected communities, ultimately addressing the broader implications of Huntington’s disease on global health.
