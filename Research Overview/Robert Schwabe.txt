Researcher: Robert Schwabe
Research Overview:
Robert Schwabe's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationship between liver diseases, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and liver fibrosis, with significant emphasis on the roles played by various cellular components such as hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), macrophages, and regulatory T cells (Tregs). His work delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism, inflammation, and the tumor microenvironment, particularly relating to liver cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Schwabe employs advanced techniques like CRISPR, single-cell genomics, and spatial transcriptomics to investigate cellular interactions and signaling pathways influenced by factors like cytokines, bile acids, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). By exploring these aspects, his research aims not only to illuminate the pathophysiological processes linked to liver injury and regeneration but also to identify potential therapeutic strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and antifibrotic therapies, to combat chronic liver diseases and improve patient outcomes. The integration of pharmacokinetic modeling and predictive modeling further enriches his investigations, emphasizing a translational approach to advancing understanding and treatment of liver-related ailments.
