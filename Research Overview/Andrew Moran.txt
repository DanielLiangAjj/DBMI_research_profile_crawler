Researcher: Andrew Moran
Research Overview:
Dr. Andrew Moran's research primarily focuses on cardiovascular health, with a strong emphasis on hypertension, cardiovascular disease prevention, and risk assessment. His work integrates clinical guidelines and public policy to understand the implications of hypertension on healthcare costs and community health. Notably, his research explores the use of mobile technology and online learning in managing blood pressure trajectories, especially among young adults and in low- and middle-income countries. Dr. Moran employs various methodologies, including simulation modeling, cost-effectiveness analyses, and community-based interventions, to evaluate treatment strategies that address the social determinants of health. His studies also look at disparities across different populations, including racial and ethnic groups, and emphasize the need for equitable access to healthcare and effective antihypertensive therapies. By engaging with global health initiatives such as the HEARTS program, Dr. Moran aims to inform strategies for improving cardiovascular health outcomes and addressing the burden of disease related to hypertension and cardiovascular conditions. Overall, his research seeks to contribute to the advancement of health systems strategies that can enhance care delivery, foster community health promotion, and ultimately, improve cardiovascular disease outcomes.
