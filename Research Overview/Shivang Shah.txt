Researcher: Shivang Shah
Research Overview:
Shivang Shah's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily centered around the intersection of immunometabolism and infectious diseases, with a particular focus on glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and its implications. His work explores the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying conditions such as Brugada syndrome, various forms of heart failure, and the impact of COVID-19 on patient outcomes, including the intricacies of telehealth and remote monitoring in managing these conditions. Additionally, Shah investigates the role of immune responses, particularly involving M2 macrophages and the metabolic pathways influenced by bacterial infections like Klebsiella pneumoniae. His research extends to public health implications in regions such as Uganda, where he examines the epidemiology of diseases like tuberculosis and malaria, emphasizing the significance of genetic associations and disease tolerance. Overall, Shivang Shah's contributions advance the understanding of complex interactions between metabolic health and immune responses in both infectious diseases and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting the importance of integrated approaches in clinical practice.
