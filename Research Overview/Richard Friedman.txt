Researcher: Richard Friedman
Research Overview:
Richard Friedmanâ€™s research predominantly centers around orthopedic surgery, particularly focussing on arthroplasties such as total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). His work extensively examines clinical outcomes, complications, and readmission rates in relation to various patient demographics such as age and body mass index (BMI). Additionally, Friedman explores the implications of systemic conditions like obesity, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular health on postoperative results. His investigations into preoperative planning techniques, including finite element analysis for glenoid component positioning, highlight a commitment to enhancing surgical precision and patient outcomes. Moreover, his research extends to the evaluation of opioid use and dependency post-surgery, weighing its impacts against patient satisfaction and recovery trajectories. Overall, his contributions aim to optimize treatment pathways and address health disparities in arthroplasty patients while also shedding light on related perioperative complications, ultimately promoting improved care standards in orthopedic practices.
