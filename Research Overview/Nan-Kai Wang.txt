Researcher: Nan-Kai Wang
Research Overview:
Nan-Kai Wang's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily focused on retinal diseases and their underlying mechanisms, particularly emphasizing genetic factors, metabolic processes, and treatment strategies. Significant keywords associated with his work include "retinal pigment epithelium," "autosomal dominant optic atrophy," "retinitis pigmentosa," and various techniques such as "whole exome sequencing" and "electroretinography." Wang has investigated metabolic reprogramming, particularly aerobic glycolysis, and its role in retinal pathology, alongside the therapeutic potentials of gene therapy and targeted injections like anti-VEGF. His research also highlights the impact of systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, on ocular health, incorporating real-world databases for deeper analysis. Additional topics of exploration include the effects of inflammation, oxidative stress, and the role of microRNAs in inherited retinal diseases. Through a combination of molecular, genetic, and clinical approaches, Wang aims to advance the understanding and treatment of various retinal conditions, particularly those linked to metabolic dysfunction and genetic predisposition, ultimately paving the way for improved therapeutic interventions and patient outcomes in ophthalmology.
