Researcher: Ryan Gaudet
Research Overview:
Ryan Gaudet's research explores the intricate interactions between various pathogens and the host immune response, with a particular focus on fungi, notably *Candida albicans*, and bacteria such as *Helicobacter pylori*, *Salmonella*, and *Shigella*. His work emphasizes cellular processes such as cell wall remodeling, fungal morphogenesis, and the mechanisms of fungal and bacterial pathogenesis. Gaudet employs functional genomics to investigate host-pathogen interactions, revealing insights into the roles of innate immunity and specific signaling pathways, including NOD-like receptors. His research also delves into the inflammatory responses triggered during coinfections and the mechanisms of immune evasion by pathogens. Through advanced methodologies, including high-throughput screening and gene editing, he aims to uncover the underlying principles of microbial viability, phagocytosis, and pyroptosis, contributing to a better understanding of infectious diseases and potential therapeutic targets.
