Researcher: Dominique Bailey
Research Overview:
Dominique Bailey's research is primarily centered around the study of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, including eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic colitis, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. The keywords and MeSH terms highlight a significant focus on health disparities related to race, sex, and socioeconomic status, emphasizing the importance of diversity and equity in healthcare access and outcomes for these conditions. Bailey investigates various aspects of disease pathophysiology, including fibrosis, reactive epithelial changes, and gut pathology, utilizing innovative methodologies such as barium esophagography and functional lumen imaging. There is also a notable interest in the developmental biology of the esophagus, influenced by human pluripotent stem cells and the enteric nervous system, as well as the implications of classifications and nomenclature in rare diseases like eosinophilic esophagitis. Overall, Bailey's contributions aim to enhance understanding of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, elucidating disease progression and fostering discussions on health equity and patient care, particularly in pediatric populations.
