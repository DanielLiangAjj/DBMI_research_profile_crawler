Researcher: Juan Schvartzman
Research Overview:
Juan Schvartzman's research primarily explores the intricate relationships between metabolic pathways, epigenetic modifications, and cancer biology, focusing particularly on the roles of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in various malignancies, including cholangiocarcinoma, liver cancer, and sarcomas. His work delves into the mechanisms of replication stress and the implications of oncometabolites such as 2-hydroxyglutarate, highlighting how these factors contribute to cellular differentiation and tumorigenesis. Schvartzman also investigates the genetic mutations associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins, cell differentiation processes, and the role of heterochromatin in the context of neoplasm development. By employing genomic and histological analyses alongside studies in animal models, he seeks to elucidate the pathways that govern cancer's progression and resistance to therapies, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of cancer biology and potential therapeutic targets.
