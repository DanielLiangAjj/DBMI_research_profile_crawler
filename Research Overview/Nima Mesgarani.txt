Researcher: Nima Mesgarani
Research Overview:
Nima Mesgarani's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics within auditory neuroscience, focusing on how the human auditory cortex processes complex auditory stimuli, particularly in challenging environments such as multi-talker situations. His work involves advanced methodologies, including intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG), to unravel the neural dynamics underlying speech perception, sound localization, and auditory object recognition. A significant aspect of his research is the application of deep learning and computational modeling to enhance binaural speech separation and voice conversion in real-time, thereby contributing to advancements in hearing aids and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Additionally, his investigations delve into the effects of aging and hearing impairments on auditory processing, employing neural entrainment and spike-field coherence analyses to illuminate the mechanisms of auditory perception. Through his work, Mesgarani aims to bridge the gap between auditory neuroscience and practical applications, leveraging insights into the auditory cortex's functional organization to inform innovative auditory technologies and treatments.
