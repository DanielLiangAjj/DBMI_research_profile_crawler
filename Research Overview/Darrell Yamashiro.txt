Researcher: Darrell Yamashiro
Research Overview:
Darrell Yamashiro's research predominantly focuses on pediatric oncology, specifically exploring novel therapeutic strategies for managing aggressive cancers such as MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and hepatoblastoma. His work encompasses the development and optimization of combination therapies involving high-dose radiation, immunotherapies anchored in immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD1 and pembrolizumab, and the application of mTOR inhibitors like everolimus and temsirolimus. Utilizing advanced techniques such as whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing, he investigates genetic mechanisms underlying various neoplasms, including Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor (MRT) and small cell variants of hepatoblastoma. Yamashiro's investigations further extend to research on immune responses and tumor microenvironments using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and innovative syngeneic mouse models, shedding light on potential pathways for precision medicine in treating pediatric cancers. His broader research contributions also address relevant dermatological conditions and genetic diseases, including congenital hepatic fibrosis and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, demonstrating a multifaceted approach to improving outcomes in pediatric patients with complex malignancies.
