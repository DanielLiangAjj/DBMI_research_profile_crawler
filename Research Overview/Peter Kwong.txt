Researcher: Peter Kwong
Research Overview:
Peter Kwong's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics, primarily focusing on the design and application of antibodies against various viral infections, particularly HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. His work highlights the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and their mechanisms of action, particularly through cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for structural analysis and the design of immunogens for vaccinations. Keywords such as 'anti-idiotype', 'neutralizing response', and 'vaccine design' indicate his exploration into innovative vaccination strategies, including the development of nanoparticle vaccines and personalized immunizations. Additionally, he investigates the interplay of antibodies with viral proteins, emphasizing the significance of protein structure and dynamics in vaccine efficacy and immune response. Besides antibody development, his research extends into the pharmacokinetics of antibody therapies, indicating a comprehensive approach to addressing infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness. His findings contribute significantly to advancing immunological strategies and therapeutic protocols, particularly in the context of ongoing global health challenges like COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS.
