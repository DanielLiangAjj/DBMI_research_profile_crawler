Researcher: Michael Shelanski
Research Overview:
Michael Shelanski's research predominantly focuses on the intricate mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and its implications for neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease. His work explores key factors such as AMPA receptors, ATF4, BDNF, and various signaling pathways related to neuronal excitability and protein transport. His studies investigate how these elements contribute to long-term potentiation (LTP), neuronal survival, and the regulation of gene expression in response to oxidative stress and amyloid beta-peptide accumulation. By employing both cellular and animal models, including transgenic and knockout mice, Shelanski elucidates the pathways involved in dendritic spine development and synaptic function. His research aims to enhance our understanding of neuronal mechanisms that govern cognition and memory, as well as identify potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s and other related cognitive disorders. Overall, Shelanski’s extensive exploration of the interplay between transcription factors, neurotrophins, and signaling proteins significantly contributes to the field of neurobiology and offers insights into potential strategies for mitigating neurodegenerative disease progression.
