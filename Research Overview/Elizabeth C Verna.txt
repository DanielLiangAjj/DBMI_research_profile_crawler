Researcher: Elizabeth C Verna
Research Overview:
Elizabeth C. Verna's research predominantly focuses on the interplay between liver disease, specifically cirrhosis, and its complications, particularly acute kidney injury and the outcomes of liver transplantation. Her work incorporates advanced methodologies such as metabolomics and proteomics to identify potential biomarkers for various liver-related conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic encephalopathy. Verna has extensively studied factors impacting patient outcomes, like frailty and healthcare utilization, and how these variables influence post-transplant results for patients with end-stage liver disease. Additionally, her investigations into the effects of viral infections—including hepatitis C and guidelines regarding the management of chronic liver diseases—aim at optimizing treatment protocols and improving the quality of life for patients. Notably, her work also addresses the healthcare disparities encountered in organ transplantation and the psychosocial dimensions affecting patient acceptance and overall well-being. As such, Verna's contributions significantly enhance our understanding of liver transplantation dynamics, patient management strategies, and the optimization of outcomes in liver disease management.
