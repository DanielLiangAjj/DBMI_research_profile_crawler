Researcher: Franck Polleux
Research Overview:
Franck Polleux's research extensively investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal development, synaptic connectivity, and the evolutionary aspects of the human brain. His work often focuses on key proteins, such as Arhgap11a and SRGAP2, that influence neuronal migration, dendritic morphology, and local translation processes essential for synapse formation and plasticity. Utilizing advanced techniques like **3D reconstruction imaging** and **optogenetics**, he explores how factors like mRNA localization, axonal transport, and mitochondrial dynamics contribute to the development and functionality of neuronal circuits in both mouse models and human neurons. His studies also address the physiological aspects of neuromodulation, including the roles of calcium signaling and synaptic adhesion molecules, while investigating implications for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Additionally, Polleux examines the evolutionary significance of human-specific genes and their impacts on brain structure and function, thereby integrating insights from genetics, neurobiology, and evolutionary biology to enhance our understanding of not only brain health but also disease mechanisms.
