Researcher: Danielle Ahn
Research Overview:
Danielle Ahn's research primarily centers around the pathogenic mechanisms, antimicrobial resistance, and host interactions of **Klebsiella pneumoniae** and associated pathogens such as **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**. A significant focus is on the emergence of carbapenem-resistant strains and their resistance to polymyxins, particularly colistin, which is often considered a last-resort antibiotic. Ahn investigates the underlying bioenergetics and metabolic adaptations of these bacteria, including the role of lipid A modifications and pathways such as glycolysis and ketogenesis in infection. Additionally, her studies delve into the interplay between bacterial infection and the host immune response, particularly the activation of immune cells like neutrophils and macrophages, and the impact of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and interleukins. Ahn's work highlights the role of immunometabolism and host-pathogen interactions, with implications for developing therapeutic strategies against multi-drug resistant organisms, particularly in vulnerable populations like pediatric patients and those in intensive care. Through elucidating these complex interactions, Ahn aims to enhance our understanding of disease tolerance and resilience against severe bacterial pneumonia, laying the groundwork for innovative treatments and prevention strategies in the context of escalating antibiotic resistance.
