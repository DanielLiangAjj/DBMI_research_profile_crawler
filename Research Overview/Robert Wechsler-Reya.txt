Researcher: Robert Wechsler-Reya
Research Overview:
Robert Wechsler-Reya's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of cancer, particularly medulloblastoma, which is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. His work encompasses various aspects of tumor biology, including the identification of signaling pathways such as Hedgehog signaling, and the role of various non-coding RNAs like long non-coding RNA (lnc-HLX-2-7) and circular RNAs in tumor progression and differentiation. Wechsler-Reya employs advanced methodologies such as single-cell sequencing, CRISPR screens, and the use of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to elucidate the origins of tumor heterogeneity and treatment resistance. His investigations into the tumor microenvironment and immune landscape, particularly in the context of immunotherapy and the potential of using nanoparticles as therapeutic delivery vehicles, aim to pave the way for precision medicine approaches in targeting pediatric brain tumors. Additionally, his studies address the metabolic pathways involved in cancer stem cell maintenance and tumor evolution. Overall, Wechsler-Reya's contributions significantly advance our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of neuro-oncological diseases and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
