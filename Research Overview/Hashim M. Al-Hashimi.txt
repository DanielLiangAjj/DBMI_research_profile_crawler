Researcher: Hashim M. Al-Hashimi
Research Overview:
Hashim M. Al-Hashimi's research primarily focuses on the intricate dynamics of nucleic acids, especially in relation to DNA damage and the recognition mechanisms involved in biological computation and mutation processes. His work delves into areas like conformational dynamics of DNA and RNA, exploring the implications of DNA repair mechanisms, replication errors, and the impact of chemical modifications such as methylation. Using techniques such as solid-state and solution-state NMR spectroscopy, he examines the behaviors of various nucleobases including guanine and adenine in polymorphic states, contributing to a deeper understanding of biophysical phenomena. His investigations into the interaction of RNA with ligands and its flexibility further advance the field of RNA-targeted drug discovery, particularly concerning HIV-1. Overall, his research aims to elucidate the fundamental biophysical properties of nucleic acids, with significant implications for molecular biology, epitranscriptomics, and therapeutic development.
