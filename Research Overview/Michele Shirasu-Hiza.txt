Researcher: Michele Shirasu-Hiza
Research Overview:
Michele Shirasu-Hiza's research predominantly focuses on the intricate biological mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms, behavior, and cellular processes in model organisms such as *Drosophila melanogaster* and *Caenorhabditis elegans*. Utilizing advanced techniques like CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing, the studies delve into the genetic, genomic, and molecular mechanisms influencing behavior, sleep patterns, and aging. The research further explores the role of the microbiome, oxidative stress, and cellular dynamics, including cytokinesis and signal transduction pathways. By examining neurobiological aspects, such as axon guidance and neuronal activity, alongside dietary influences on longevity, Shirasu-Hiza's work contributes significant insights into developmental biology, neuroscience, and the complex interactions that govern life processes and health. Overall, the research advances our understanding of how genetic and environmental factors interplay in modulating behavior and physiological responses in living organisms.
