Researcher: Francesca Bartolini
Research Overview:
Francesca Bartolini's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms underlying neuronal development, synaptic transmission, and neurodegeneration, particularly in the context of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and peripheral neuropathies. Her work extensively examines the role of microtubules and related cytoskeletal dynamics in axon outgrowth, neuronal polarity, and synapse formation, utilizing advanced techniques in cell biology and microscopy. Emphasizing molecular interactions, she investigates the regulation of microtubule-associated proteins, post-translational modifications of tubulin, and the influence of various signaling pathways—including RhoA—on neuronal function and structural integrity. Her studies also explore the impact of activated microglia and inflammation on neurodegenerative processes, integrating insights from lipidomics and transcriptomics. By leveraging both animal models, including mice and Drosophila, and human cellular systems, Bartolini's research contributes vital knowledge to understanding neuronal behavior, neuropathic conditions, and potential therapeutic avenues in neurobiology.
