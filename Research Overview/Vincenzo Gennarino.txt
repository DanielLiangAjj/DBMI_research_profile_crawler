Researcher: Vincenzo Gennarino
Research Overview:
Vincenzo Gennarino's research focuses on the intricate roles of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their interactomes within various biological contexts, particularly neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. His work extensively examines the interactions of key proteins such as AGO2, FMRP, and Pumilio within the brain interactome, utilizing model organisms and advanced microscopy techniques to elucidate cell biology mechanisms. Gennarino has investigated the relationship between genetic mutations and neuropsychiatric conditions, emphasizing the implications of alternative splicing and RNA homeostasis in diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s and spinocerebellar ataxia. Additionally, his research includes examining the effects of genetic factors on tumor suppression and cell differentiation in various cancers, including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Overall, Gennarino's contributions are pivotal in advancing the understanding of genetic and molecular underpinnings behind both developmental and neurodegenerative diseases, thereby offering insights that could lead to potential therapeutic strategies.
