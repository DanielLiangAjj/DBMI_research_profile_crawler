Researcher: Eldad Hod
Research Overview:
Eldad Hod's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily centered on hematology, transfusion medicine, and the implications of blood components in various health conditions. The researcher has extensively studied intracerebral hemorrhage and thromboembolism, focusing on how factors like RBC deformability, coagulation assays, and blood type compatibility impact outcomes following transfusions. Key findings involve the relationship between oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and the storage lesions of red blood cells, particularly in light of various dietary influences such as fish oil supplementation. Moreover, Hod has explored the interplay between infections, particularly COVID-19, and blood transfusion reactions, indicating potential underlying mechanisms influencing patient outcomes. His work incorporates big data analytics and metabolomics to enhance precision transfusion medicine, highlighting the importance of genetic variation and immunological responses in transfusion safety and efficiency. Ultimately, Hod's research advances our understanding of transfusion-related complications, innovative diagnostic approaches, and treatment modalities that enhance patient care in hematological contexts.
