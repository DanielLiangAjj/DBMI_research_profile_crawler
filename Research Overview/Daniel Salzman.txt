Researcher: Daniel Salzman
Research Overview:
Daniel Salzman's research focuses on the intricate interplay of neural dynamics, particularly in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus, in relation to emotional processing, decision-making, and learning behaviors in both nonhuman primates and computational models. His work examines how specific neural circuits—especially those involving interneurons and somatostatin cells—contribute to various cognitive functions such as attention, motivation, and value processing, through mechanisms such as fear discrimination and reward history adaptation. The research employs advanced methodologies like optogenetics, microstimulation, and artificial neural networks to unravel the representational geometry of neural responses and to decode temporal aspects of working memory. By integrating neurophysiological findings with computational biology approaches, Salzman's studies elucidate the underlying mechanisms of emotion and cognition, contributing significantly to our understanding of the brain's functionality in complex behavior and decision-making processes.
