Researcher: Hachung Chung
Research Overview:
Hachung Chung's research primarily focuses on the intricate roles of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the context of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, particularly examining conditions such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. Utilizing advanced techniques such as RNA sequencing and exploring the mechanisms of RNA editing—specifically through A-to-I editing mediated by ADAR1—Chung investigates the intersection of nucleic acid immunity and neuronal function. His work delves into the signaling pathways activated by both RNA and DNA sensing PRRs, including MDA5, RIG-I, TLR3, TLR7/8, cGAS, and AIM2, highlighting their contribution to innate immunity in the brain. By studying the implications of these molecular interactions and their effects on neurodevelopment and neuroinflammatory diseases, Chung aims to uncover potential therapeutic strategies for managing autoimmune conditions and neurodegenerative disorders, thereby advancing our understanding of the delicate balance between immunity and neuronal health in the central nervous system.
