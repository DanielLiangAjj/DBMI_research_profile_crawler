Researcher: Max E. Gottesman
Research Overview:
Max E. Gottesman’s research intricately explores the molecular mechanisms underpinning transcription regulation, DNA repair processes, and interactions between transcription and translation in prokaryotic systems, particularly Escherichia coli. His work delves into topics such as liquid-liquid phase separation, transcription elongation, and the roles of various factors like NusG and anti-backtracking proteins in transcription processes. Gottesman is also focused on transcription-translation coupling, investigating how disruptions caused by DNA double-strand breaks can affect cellular functions and genomic stability. His research into the biochemical principles of enzyme catalysis and the specificity of RNA polymerase further contributes to the understanding of nucleic acid metabolism. Recent investigations include the impact of COVID-19 on anosmia, illustrating a broad application of his findings to human health. Overall, Gottesman’s contributions significantly enhance our comprehension of the dynamic interplay between genomic integrity, transcriptional control, and cellular architecture, combining biochemistry, structural biology, and molecular genetics.
