Researcher: Sharon Wardlaw
Research Overview:
Sharon Wardlaw's research focuses on the complexities surrounding aggressive forms of pituitary tumors, specifically pituitary carcinoma and treatment-refractory variants, emphasizing their hormonal and neuroendocrine profiles. Her investigations delve into the biological mechanisms underpinning these tumors, including the roles played by proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and melanocortin receptors in metabolism and appetite regulation. Beyond tumor pathology, her work addresses related physiological issues such as obesity, heart failure, and repercussions of hypopituitarism. Additionally, her studies engage with the neurobiological aspects of appetite control and metabolic homeostasis, which intersect with hormonal signaling pathways, particularly in relation to stress responses, insulin resistance, and the impact of environmental cues such as sleep deprivation. The multifaceted nature of her research positions it at the crossroads of oncology, endocrinology, and metabolic disorders, thereby contributing vital insights into treatment strategies and therapeutic interventions for patients with pituitary tumors and associated metabolic conditions.
