Researcher: Henry Colecraft
Research Overview:
Henry Colecraft's research primarily focuses on the intricate mechanisms of calcium and potassium ion channels, crucial for understanding cardiac physiology and pathology. His work explores excitation-contraction coupling, ion channel regulation and trafficking, with specific emphasis on the KCNQ1 and hERG channels, both significant in cardiac arrhythmias and long QT syndromes. Utilizing biochemical, cellular, and molecular approaches, including RNA therapeutics and nanobody technology, Colecraft investigates the modulation of ion channels and their contribution to cardiovascular diseases. His research employs advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy and fluorescence flow cytometry to elucidate channel gating, permeation, and the dynamics of associated protein interactions. Furthermore, his studies extend to the implications of oxidative stress and metabolic factors on cardiac myocyte function, thereby bridging basic science with potential therapeutic applications in cardiology and beyond.
