Researcher: Stephanie Lovinsky-Desir
Research Overview:
Dr. Stephanie Lovinsky-Desir's research primarily focuses on pediatric asthma and its intersections with environmental health, social determinants of health, and health equity. Her studies explore how factors such as urban air pollution, particularly particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, contribute to asthma exacerbations and overall morbidity among children in marginalized communities. Emphasizing diversity, equity, and inclusion, her work also examines the implications of systemic racism and area-level vulnerability on asthma prevalence and treatment outcomes. Through innovative methodologies like real-time personal monitoring and integration of genetic and environmental data, Dr. Lovinsky-Desir actively investigates biomarkers, such as mitochondrial markers and DNA methylation patterns, that may elucidate the complex interactions of biological and environmental triggers in asthma. By addressing the multifaceted nature of asthma within socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, her research aims to inform public health strategies and policy interventions that promote environmental justice and health equity for affected children.
