Researcher: Qing R. Fan
Research Overview:
Qing R. Fan's research primarily focuses on the biochemistry and structural biology of key receptors, particularly the calcium-sensing receptor and GABAB receptor, exploring their activation mechanisms and modulation through allosteric interactions. Utilizing advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography, Fan examines the molecular structures, symmetry, and binding sites of these receptors, revealing the intricacies of ligand recognition and receptor activation involving principal and auxiliary subunits. The studies extend to the roles of various proteins, including GTP-binding proteins and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, in intracellular signaling and calcium homeostasis. By leveraging models derived from both human and animal studies, Fan's work contributes significantly to understanding the functional dynamics of G protein-coupled receptors and their implications in cellular signaling pathways. This research paves the way for potential therapeutic applications in modulating these signaling mechanisms for various diseases.
