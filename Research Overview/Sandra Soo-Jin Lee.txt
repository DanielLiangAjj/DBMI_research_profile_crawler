Researcher: Sandra Soo-Jin Lee
Research Overview:
Sandra Soo-Jin Lee's research primarily delves into the intersection of genetics, bioethics, and health equity, concentrating on the ethical implications of genetic testing and counseling, particularly within marginalized populations. Her work emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion in precision medicine and genomic research, advocating for equitable access to genetic resources and services. Lee explores issues of informed consent, community engagement, and the responsible dissemination of research results, aiming to foster trust and transparency between research personnel and participants. Through qualitative research methods, she seeks to address biases and disparities within health systems, particularly for underserved communities, and advocates for collaborative, multidisciplinary approaches in team science. Her investigations into hereditary cancer syndromes, such as Lynch syndrome and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, underline the need for culturally sensitive communication and precise risk assessments in genetic counseling. Overall, Lee's research is pivotal in shaping ethical frameworks and policies that guide genomic medicine and promote health justice for all populations.
