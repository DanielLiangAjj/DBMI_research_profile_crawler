Researcher: Wesley Grueber
Research Overview:
Wesley Grueber's research primarily focuses on understanding the intricate mechanisms of neural circuit formation and function in Drosophila melanogaster, particularly regarding sensory processing, motor control, and nociception. His work encompasses a range of topics including axon targeting, dendrite morphogenesis, and synaptic specificity, revealing how various cellular and molecular factors contribute to the establishment of robust neural networks. Key areas of investigation involve the roles of cell adhesion molecules, like Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam2), and the utilization of advanced imaging techniques such as light-sheet and calcium imaging to capture nuanced neuronal behaviors and interactions. By exploring topics like pain perception and reflex responses through rolling escape behavior in larvae, Grueber's findings shed light on the parallels between Drosophila models and broader neurodevelopmental and peripheral nerve conditions. His comprehensive approach combines elements of cell biology, molecular biology, and genetic engineering, further enriching our understanding of neural dynamics and their implications for human neurological disorders.
