Researcher: Philip De Jager
Research Overview:
Philip De Jager's research primarily focuses on the mechanisms and genetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimerâ€™s disease and multiple sclerosis. He employs advanced methodologies including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), and multi-omic approaches to explore both the transcriptome and proteome of affected neural cells. His work emphasizes the importance of understanding immune cell interactions, neuroinflammation, and genetic susceptibility in relation to cognitive decline and aging. De Jager investigates key biomarkers and genetic markers through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and examines the influence of environmental factors on neurodegenerative disease progression. The integration of precision medicine and epigenetics into his research aims to elucidate potential therapeutic strategies and improve prognosis in diverse populations. Overall, De Jager's contributions advance the understanding of complex mechanisms involved in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, bridging molecular genetics with clinical implications in neurology.
