Researcher: Charles Zuker
Research Overview:
Charles Zuker's research delves into the complex interplay between sensory perception, particularly taste, and its impact on behavior and memory. His studies highlight how different taste modalities—sweet, sour, and bitter—are encoded in the brain through specific neuronal circuits, including the cortex and amygdala, and their physiological feedback mechanisms. Zuker's work also extends to the implications of these sensory pathways for nutrition, eating behaviors, and public health, particularly concerning obesity and dietary preferences. By employing techniques such as single-cell gene expression analysis and optogenetics, he investigates the neural underpinnings of innate behaviors and the brain-gut axis, shedding light on the effects of cytokines and inflammation on taste perception and feeding behavior. Ultimately, his research contributes to a deeper understanding of how sensory signaling shapes our eating habits and health outcomes, bridging neurobiology with public health considerations.
