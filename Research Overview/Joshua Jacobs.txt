Researcher: Joshua Jacobs
Research Overview:
Joshua Jacobs' research spans various domains including orthopedic surgery, particularly focused on total joint arthroplasty (both hip and knee), as well as pharmacology related to hypertension and hereditary angioedema. His studies investigate crucial issues such as adverse local tissue reactions, implant corrosion, and complications arising from joint replacements, while also evaluating the clinical management of cardiovascular conditions. Jacobs conducts extensive work on medication adherence and the implications of rural-urban healthcare disparities, exploring the impact of various antihypertensives and statins on cardiovascular risk and patient outcomes. Moreover, he delves into the neurosurgical aspects of brain function, memory, and the neurophysiological underpinnings of navigation through the investigation of theta rhythms and neural representation. By integrating bioethics and health policy within his research framework, Jacobs aims to enhance treatment outcomes through improved surgical practices, enhanced understanding of medication effects, and addressing systemic healthcare disparities. Overall, his comprehensive approach contributes significantly to the fields of orthopedic surgery, pharmacology, and neural sciences, reflecting a commitment to enhancing patient care and advancing clinical practices.
