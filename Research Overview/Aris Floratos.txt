Researcher: Aris Floratos
Research Overview:
Aris Floratos' research encompasses a diverse array of topics, primarily focused on health disparities, particularly among African Americans and European populations, and the genomic profiling of diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC). His work integrates advanced methodologies such as the Chip Analysis Methylation Pipeline (ChAMP) to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs). His studies delve into the implications of microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutation burden (TMB), and master transcriptional regulators (MTRs) in understanding cancer heterogeneity. Furthermore, Floratos investigates the pharmacogenomics of drug hypersensitivity reactions to Î²-lactams and the adverse effects of medications such as cephalosporins and penicillins, emphasizing the role of genetic predispositions determined through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Overall, his research contributes significantly to the understanding of genetic factors influencing health outcomes and the biological underpinnings of disease vulnerability, particularly in marginalized populations.
