Researcher: Elizabeth Olson
Research Overview:
Elizabeth Olson's research spans a diverse array of topics, primarily focusing on animal biology, audiology, mental health, and innovative health interventions. Her work incorporates biogeographical studies of various mammalian species, particularly within the orders Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla, and Rodentia, using techniques like camera trapping to explore biodiversity. Concurrently, Olson has made significant contributions to cochlear implant technology and otological health, investigating inner ear diagnostics, drug delivery methods, and outcomes of cochlear implantation. On the psychological side, she explores the impacts of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its associations with brain structures like the amygdala and the entorhinal cortex while assessing connections with depression and anxiety through advanced neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging. Additionally, her work emphasizes public policy issues in health care and training in clinical settings, merging her findings with implications for mental health interventions like internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy. Overall, Olson's multidisciplinary approach highlights critical intersections between animal studies, hearing research, mental health, and health care policy, contributing valuable insights to each field.
