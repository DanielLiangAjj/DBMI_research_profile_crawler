Researcher: Richard Baer
Research Overview:
Richard Baer's research primarily investigates the intricate mechanisms of DNA repair, genomic stability, and cancer biology, particularly in relation to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. His studies delve into the consequences of double-strand breaks and how various proteins, including ATM/ATR, CtIP, and RAD51, contribute to the DNA damage response and homologous recombination processes vital for cellular integrity. Baer is also interested in somatic cell reprogramming, highlighting the impacts of replication stress and stalled replication forks on pluripotency and genomic integrity. His work expands into cancer immunotherapy, focusing on PD-L1 regulation and the interplay between cancer-intrinsic innate immunity and treatments such as PARP inhibitors. Additionally, Baer's research touches upon chronic kidney disease, examining disease progression, vascular access, and health outcomes within diverse populations, particularly Indigenous Australians. His contributions offer significant insights into the molecular underpinnings of diseases and potential therapeutic avenues, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach combining molecular biology, immunology, and epidemiology.
