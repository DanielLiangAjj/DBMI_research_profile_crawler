Researcher: Noémie Elhadad
Research Overview:
Noémie Elhadad's research encapsulates a multidisciplinary approach at the intersection of health informatics, machine learning, and health equity, focusing on the optimization and utilization of electronic health records (EHRs) to address disparities in healthcare. Her investigations delve deeply into causal fairness and the ethical implications of AI and machine learning in public health, particularly in relation to infectious diseases like COVID-19 and HIV management. By employing advanced natural language processing and data mining techniques, Elhadad seeks to improve decision support systems and clinical outcomes through real-world data analysis. Additionally, her work on women's health, particularly concerning conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome, emphasizes the importance of personalized patient care enriched by novel tools like health coaching and mobile health applications. Ultimately, her contributions aim not only to advance bioinformatics and the accuracy of disease surveillance but also to foster equitable healthcare practices that are informed by social determinants of health and patient-generated data.
