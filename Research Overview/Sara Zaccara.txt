Researcher: Sara Zaccara
Research Overview:
Sara Zaccara's research focuses on the intricate relationship between mRNA regulation and cellular processes, such as transcription, translation, and apoptosis, with particular attention to the role of RNA-binding proteins and epitranscriptomics. Key areas of her work involve the regulation of gene expression through mechanisms like m6A methylation, which affects mRNA stability and translation dynamics. She investigates the roles of specific proteins such as YTHDC1, YTHDF1-3, DHX30, and PCBP2 in these processes. Her studies utilize computational bioinformatics and transcriptomic analyses to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of tumor suppressor proteins like p53 in various cellular contexts, including stress responses and cancer. By employing techniques like polysomal profiling, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and RNA interference, her research aims to illuminate the complex regulatory networks that govern gene expression and contribute to cellular differentiation and apoptosis.
