Researcher: Hashim Al-Hashimi
Research Overview:
Hashim Al-Hashimi's research focuses on the intricate dynamics and structural conformations of nucleic acids and their implications in various biological processes, particularly in the context of human health and disease. His work delves into the conformational ensembles of DNA, including the exploration of structures formed through Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base pairing, and the dynamics influencing DNA damage and repair mechanisms such as those involving 8-oxoguanine. Additionally, Al-Hashimi has investigated RNA dynamics, structural variations, and modifications, assessing their roles in processes like RNA splicing, epitranscriptomics, and transcriptional regulation, particularly regarding HIV-1. Utilizing advanced techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, his studies on mutational signatures and RNA-ligand interactions aim to enhance our understanding of molecular computation and drug discovery strategies. Overall, Al-Hashimi's contributions significantly advance the fields of structural biology, developmental biology, oncology, and neurobiology, establishing critical links between nucleic acid dynamics and cellular function in health and illness, thereby informing potential therapeutic approaches for diseases like cancer and HIV.
