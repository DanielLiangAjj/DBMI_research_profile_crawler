Researcher: Christine Kim
Research Overview:
Christine Kim's research encompasses a diverse range of topics focused on the molecular and clinical aspects of various disease states and health conditions. She investigates the roles of specific genes and mutations, such as SAR1A and RHOA G17V, in relation to conditions like sickle cell disease and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Her work explores the intersections of genetic predisposition, motor learning, and movement disorders, particularly in the context of essential tremor and dystonia. Additionally, her research touches on public health issues, such as the promotion and monitoring of breastfeeding practices in Cambodia, guided by the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. Kim employs advanced methodologies, including computerized spiral analysis, to assess neurological functions and treatment outcomes for conditions like osteoarthritis and Parkinson's disease. Overall, her investigations aim to bridge the gaps between molecular genetics, clinical diagnosis, and public health strategies, contributing to improved treatment approaches and health policies.
