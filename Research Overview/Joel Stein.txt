Researcher: Joel Stein
Research Overview:
Joel Stein's research focuses on advancing rehabilitation practices for individuals with neurological conditions, specifically spinal cord injuries, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. Central to his work is the exploration of innovative therapies such as epidural and non-invasive neurostimulation techniques, robotic-assisted rehabilitation, and tailored exercise programs aimed at enhancing motor recovery and postural control. His studies also investigate the effects of various interventions, including aerobic exercise, balance training, and cognitive strategies, on functional outcomes and overall quality of life for patients. By employing advanced methodologies like artificial neural networks and brain mapping techniques, Stein aims to optimize rehabilitation strategies and foster neuronal plasticity for improved recovery trajectories. His commitment to integrating technology in healthcare highlights the potential of telerehabilitation and wearable robotics in patient-centered care, reflecting a multifaceted approach to improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with movement disorders.
