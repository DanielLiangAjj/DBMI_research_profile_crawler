Researcher: Keren Griffiths
Research Overview:
Keren Griffithsâ€™ research extensively explores the intricate roles of coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) and mitochondrial function in various biological contexts, focusing on their implications in cardiotoxicity, metabolic regulation, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome. Employing animal models, including newborn mice and cardiac myocyte studies, her work investigates the mechanisms of mitochondrial permeability transition pore dynamics, proton leak, and energy coupling, particularly under conditions influenced by anesthetics like propofol and metabolic stresses. Griffiths also examines the interactions of mitochondrial processes with brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and reactive oxygen species, linking these findings to broader implications for heart health and neurogenesis. Overall, her research contributes valuable insights into mitochondrial biology, with potential applications in understanding drug effects, cardiac dysfunction, and neurodevelopmental challenges.
