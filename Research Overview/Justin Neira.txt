Researcher: Justin Neira
Research Overview:
Justin Neira's research primarily focuses on the intersection of neuro-oncology and innovative surgical techniques in the management of brain tumors, particularly those affecting the pineal gland and central nervous system. His work encompasses the exploration of biomarkers and the histopathological characteristics of tumors such as glioblastomas and low-grade gliomas, including the variant H3 K27M. Neira investigates the implications of the MAPK signaling pathway and PTPN11 mutations on tumor behavior and treatment outcomes. His studies also emphasize advanced drug delivery methodologies, including convection-enhanced delivery and the use of fluorescein for fluorescence-guided resection, aiming to improve resection rates and overall survival in patients. Furthermore, he examines critical aspects of minimally invasive surgical approaches and the stability and alignment in the treatment of spinal and cervical tumors. Through a blend of experimental and clinical strategies, Neira contributes to the evolving field of neurosurgery and oncological treatment, striving to enhance patient care in the context of complex brain neoplasms.
