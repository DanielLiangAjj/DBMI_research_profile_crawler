Researcher: Richard Friesner
Research Overview:
Richard Friesner's research predominantly focuses on the computational aspects of protein interactions and drug design, delving into binding affinity predictions, protein-protein interactions, and the optimization of protein binding interfaces. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as free energy perturbation (FEP), molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum calculations, his work aims to decipher complex biochemical phenomena, including protein stability and the mechanisms by which proteins interact with ligands. Notable applications of his research include studying the receptor-binding domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the context of COVID-19, as well as exploring the characteristics of antibodies and their engineering. His contributions extend to designing physics-based models and computational strategies that facilitate drug discovery efforts and enhance our understanding of various proteins' structural dynamics and thermodynamics. Through this collective body of work, Friesner significantly advances the fields of computational chemistry and biophysics, laying the groundwork for innovative therapeutic intervention strategies.
