Researcher: Jonathan Javitch
Research Overview:
Jonathan Javitch's research significantly advances the understanding of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their roles in neuropharmacology and behavioral neuroscience. His work focuses on the intrinsic efficacy of various ligands, particularly concerning μ-opioid receptors and related systems, such as the dopamine and cannabinoid receptors, highlighting their complex signaling mechanisms and interactions with β-arrestin. By utilizing cutting-edge techniques—including bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), single-molecule imaging, and cryo-electron microscopy—Javitch aims to elucidate the structural and conformational dynamics of these receptors, enhancing the development of safer opioid alternatives and therapeutic agents for conditions like schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. His investigations include critical components of receptor signaling pathways, the impact of ligands on receptor conformations, and the physiological implications of signaling biases in neuronal circuit assemblies. This multifaceted approach sets the foundation for future drug discovery and the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, while also addressing the challenges of respiratory depression associated with opioid use.
