Researcher: Stefano Fusi
Research Overview:
Stefano Fusi's research is centered on understanding the complex computations and coding mechanisms within neural circuits, particularly focusing on the roles of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and somatosensory areas in cognition, learning, and memory. His studies encompass varied topics such as neural representations, mixed selectivity, oscillations, and neuromodulation, employing advanced methodologies like calcium imaging and neural network models. Fusi investigates how memory processes, including novelty recognition, social memory, and the dynamics of place cells, contribute to behavioral outcomes and cognition. By integrating concepts from artificial intelligence and computational models, his work extends into understanding how abstract concepts and sensory perceptions are processed in the brain, shedding light on neuronal plasticity and the behavioral implications of these neural mechanisms. Overall, Fusi's research critically merges neuroscience with computational approaches, providing insights into the underlying neural dynamics that inform cognition and memory.
