Researcher: Carol Troy
Research Overview:
Carol Troy's research primarily investigates the interplay between neurodegeneration, cell death, and neuroprotection, with a focus on various models of brain and retinal disorders. Her studies extensively explore the roles of key molecules such as CD44, caspases (including caspase-2, -3, -6, and -9), and neurotrophic factors in conditions like hypoxia, seizures, and traumatic brain injury. Additionally, she examines astrocyte function in the context of ischemia and edema, as well as the implications of neurogenesis and apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells affected by conditions like retinal vein occlusion and albinism. Troyâ€™s work also delves into broader themes related to public health issues, including immigrant labor and cultural adjustment, highlighting her multidisciplinary approach to research. Through the use of animal models and advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and electroretinography, her findings aim to enhance our understanding of neurovascular interactions, cellular survival mechanisms, and the molecular pathways underlying several neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive disabilities. Overall, her research contributes significantly to the fields of neuroscience, neuroprotection, and public health insights related to neurological conditions.
