Researcher: Rene Hen
Research Overview:
Rene Hen's research encompasses a comprehensive exploration of adult neurogenesis, particularly within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and its implications in various mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. His work utilizes advanced methodologies like in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, optogenetics, and mouse models to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of neurogenesis, the neurobiological effects of antidepressants, and the relationship between neural circuitry and behavior. Hen's investigations into the roles of stress, inflammation, and factors like glucocorticoids and serotonin receptors (including 5-HT1A and 5-HT4) highlight how early-life adversity and ongoing psychological stressors can impact neurogenesis and reward processing. Furthermore, his assessments of behavioral responses, such as anhedonia and patterns of reward evaluation, underscore the complexity of psychiatric disorders and the fundamental role of neuroplasticity and neuronal connectivity in developing effective therapeutic strategies. Through his systematic reviews and meta-analyses, Hen contributes significantly to the understanding of mood disorders, proposing innovative avenues for drug discovery and therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing stress resilience and improving overall mental health outcomes.
