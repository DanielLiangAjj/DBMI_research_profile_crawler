Researcher: Donald Landry
Research Overview:
Donald Landry's research encompasses a broad array of topics primarily focused on the biochemical and pharmacological aspects of various compounds, particularly relating to neurology, metabolic disorders, and cancer therapeutics. His work often investigates the roles of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, nitric oxide signaling, and neuronal plasticity in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and stroke, highlighting their potential neuroprotective effects. Landry has explored the metabolic stability of novel drug candidates like quinoline derivatives, elucidating structure-activity relationships (SAR) through high-throughput screening and functional assays. Additionally, his investigations into drug delivery systems and the degradation pathways of compounds, as well as the implications for cocaine use disorder, position his research at the intersection of medicinal chemistry and clinical applications in diverse health challenges, including vascular disorders and viral pathologies like COVID-19. Overall, Landryâ€™s research underscores the importance of biochemical interactions and therapeutic interventions in enhancing functional independence and improving patient outcomes across various disease models.
