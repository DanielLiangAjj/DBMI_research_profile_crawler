Researcher: Michael Shadlen
Research Overview:
Michael Shadlen's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of decision-making and perceptual judgments through a multidisciplinary lens that integrates neuroscience, psychophysics, and computational modeling. By employing advanced techniques such as optogenetics, multi-neuron recording, and behavioral modeling in non-human primates, particularly Macaca mulatta, Shadlen investigates the neural dynamics of the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), the role of beta oscillations, and the processes underlying evidence accumulation during decision-making tasks. His work also encompasses aspects of memory, spatial awareness, and motion perception, addressing the factors that influence cognitive flexibility, reaction times, and confidence in choices. Overall, Shadlenâ€™s contributions significantly enhance the understanding of cognitive processes related to decision-making, bridging the gap between neural activity and behavior.
