Researcher: Kathleen Capaccione
Research Overview:
Kathleen Capaccione's research prominently encompasses the intersection of cancer biology, precision medicine, and advanced imaging techniques. Her work investigates critical aspects of cell signaling, particularly the role of TGF-β in fibrosis and tumor microenvironments, highlighting its implications in breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Capaccione emphasizes early detection and diagnostic methodologies for various malignancies, utilizing innovative tools such as deep learning and multimodal imaging, including chest computed tomography (CT) and PET imaging. Privacy is also a significant focus, investigating CAR T cell therapy's impact and its associated adverse events in the context of solid tumors and immunotherapy. Her research sheds light on the interplay between pulmonary conditions, including interstitial lung disease, and cancer, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering the implications for patients with preexisting pulmonary complications. Overall, Capaccione’s contributions advance understanding in oncological diagnosis and treatment, particularly through developing precision medicine approaches tailored to individual patient needs.
