Researcher: Veli Topkara
Research Overview:
Veli Topkaraâ€™s research extensively investigates the fields of heart and kidney transplantation, with a particular focus on the use of mechanical circulatory support devices, such as left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). His work encompasses the complexities of graft rejection, solid organ transplantation outcomes, long-term patient survival, and the impact of immunosuppressive therapies. Topkara employs advanced techniques like deep learning and machine learning to enhance early detection of complications and optimize risk assessment for patients undergoing heart and kidney transplants. His studies also address disparities in healthcare, patient demographics, and socioeconomic factors influencing transplant eligibility and outcomes. Key areas of exploration include cardiac hemodynamics, the interplay between heart failure and renal function, strategies for managing patient comorbidities, and the role of biological and technological innovations in transplant immunology. Overall, Topkara's research endeavors significantly contribute to improving survival rates and quality of life for transplant recipients while addressing critical gaps in clinical protocols and health equity in transplant care.
