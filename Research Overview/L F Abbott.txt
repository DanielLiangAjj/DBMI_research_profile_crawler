Researcher: L F Abbott
Research Overview:
L F Abbott's research encompasses a wide spectrum of topics within computational neuroscience, focusing extensively on the dynamics of neuronal circuits involved in learning, memory, and sensory processing. Key areas of study include the roles of dendritic spikes, synaptic plasticity, and recurrent neural networks across various brain regions, such as the hippocampus, cerebellum, and motor cortex. The researcher investigates how neural representations of sensory stimuli, including olfactory cues, are processed through complex neural architectures, including spiking networks and factor models, which mirror natural neuronal organization found in organisms like Drosophila melanogaster and electric fish. Abbott's work integrates theoretical modeling with experimental observations, aiming to elucidate mechanisms of memory formation, decision-making, and motor control, all while employing machine learning techniques to enhance understanding of neural computations. This multidisciplinary approach underscores the significance of population dynamics and connectivity patterns in shaping neural function and adaptability, ultimately contributing to the broader fields of systems neuroscience and computational biology.
