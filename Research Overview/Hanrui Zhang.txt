Researcher: Hanrui Zhang
Research Overview:
Hanrui Zhang's research primarily centers around cardiovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis, and explores the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions. A significant focus includes the role of smooth muscle cells and macrophages in atherosclerotic plaque formation and their interactions with lipids, inflammation, and extracellular matrix components. The researcher employs diverse methodologies, including confocal laser scanning microscopy, RNA sequencing, and network pharmacology, to investigate pathways affecting lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cellular response mechanisms in various disease models. In addition, Zhangâ€™s work delves into the implications of neurodegenerative diseases like Machado-Joseph disease, demonstrating a comprehensive approach that integrates insights from genomics, systems biology, and treatment strategies. By addressing the multifaceted aspects of cardiovascular and neurological disorders, Zhang contributes valuable knowledge in the field, potentially guiding future therapies and interventions aimed at improving patient outcomes in these complex diseases.
