Researcher: Mark Ansorge
Research Overview:
Mark Ansorge's research spans across several interconnected domains within neuroscience and endocrinology, focusing particularly on the roles of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine in behavior, learning, memory, and various mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. His work involves the utilization of mouse models to investigate the mechanisms by which G-protein coupled receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors influence synaptic plasticity and neural circuit assembly in key brain regions, including the striatum, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. By employing advanced techniques like optogenetics and imaging genetics, Ansorge explores the critical periods of neurodevelopment and the heritability of behaviors associated with major depressive disorder and anxiety. His studies also delve into the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other neuropharmacological agents, assessing their impact on neurochemical pathways and behavioral outcomes. Overall, his research is pivotal in unraveling the biochemical underpinnings of mental health disorders and the developmental trajectories that contribute to them, providing insights that may inform therapeutic strategies.
