Researcher: Michelle E. Ernst
Research Overview:
Michelle E. Ernst's research primarily centers around the intersection of education, genetic counseling, and genetic disorders, emphasizing the impact of COVID-19 on curriculum development and practitioner-based inquiry in educational settings. Her work delves into various genetic conditions, including generalized epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders, utilizing advanced methodologies such as whole exome sequencing and next-generation sequencing to elucidate genetic mutations associated with these disorders. Ernst's investigations highlight the importance of program evaluation and cost-efficiency in genomic research while advocating for socioeconomic diversity and effective recruitment methods in studies. Her extensive focus on intellectual disability, developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, and the implications of genetic variations, positions her research as a vital contribution to personalized medicine and the broader understanding of the genetic underpinnings of neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, her work seeks to bridge genetic research with educational frameworks, paving the way for informed practices in both genetic counseling and medical education.
