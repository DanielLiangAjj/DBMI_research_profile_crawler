Researcher: Lena Mamykina
Research Overview:
Lena Mamykina's research focuses on enhancing self-management strategies in chronic diseases, particularly diabetes, through innovative health technologies. Utilizing frameworks such as the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, she emphasizes the importance of motivation, personalization, and self-determination in health care interventions aimed at older populations. Her work integrates machine learning, mobile health (mHealth) applications, and conversational agents, such as chatbots, to provide personalized health coaching and patient support. She explores the intersection of health informatics and behavioral health, advocating for a patient-provider partnership that fosters self-monitoring and self-care. Through qualitative studies and community-based participatory research, Mamykina addresses health disparities and seeks to improve accessibility to health information, particularly in medically underserved populations. Her research aspires to not only advance chronic disease management but also enhance overall well-being through informed health behaviors and tailored care interventions.
