Researcher: Jianwen Que
Research Overview:
Jianwen Que's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily centered around cancer biology, stem cell dynamics, metabolism, and regenerative medicine. His work delves into the intricate mechanisms governing adipose tissue regulation, aging, and metabolic dysfunction, highlighting the critical roles of estrogen receptor β and other molecular pathways such as WNT signaling and NF-κB in cancer metastasis, particularly in esophageal and gastric cancers. Additionally, Que's investigations into the microenvironmental niche for lymphatic endothelial cells and the regeneration processes involving stem cells underscore the therapeutic potential of targeted interventions for conditions like COVID-19 and lung injury. Utilizing advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and conditional blastocyst complementation, he aims to unravel the complexities of cell differentiation and lineage tracing that are pivotal in understanding tissue regeneration and the immune response to infections. Through his integrated approach combining developmental biology, molecular biology, and clinical insights, Que's research seeks to elucidate the fundamental pathways that govern both normal physiological processes and pathological states, paving the way for innovative therapies in oncology and regenerative medicine.
