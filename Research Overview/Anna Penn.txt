Researcher: Anna Penn
Research Overview:
Anna Penn's research primarily focuses on the intricate interplay between prenatal factors and neurodevelopmental outcomes, particularly in the context of preterm birth and associated complications. A significant portion of her work investigates the effects of chorioamnionitis, hypoxia, and inflammation on the placenta, brain development, and neuropsychological disorders in neonates. She explores the roles of key neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone and the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) in both placental and fetal brain health, as well as the implications of these factors on conditions such as preeclampsia and neurodevelopmental disorders. Her studies employ advanced methodologies, including neuroimaging, gene expression analysis, and pathological assessments, to unravel the molecular and cellular dynamics influencing brain maturation in preterm infants. By highlighting the impact of prenatal exposures and placental health on long-term neurodevelopment, her research contributes significantly to the fields of fetal medicine, neonatology, and neuroplacentology, ultimately aiming to inform clinical practices and improve outcomes for at-risk populations.
