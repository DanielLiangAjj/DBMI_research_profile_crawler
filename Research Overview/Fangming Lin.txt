Researcher: Fangming Lin
Research Overview:
Fangming Lin's research focuses on the intersection of genetic and clinical approaches to kidney diseases, particularly in the context of pediatric nephrology. His work underscores the feasibility of genetic diagnosis in conditions such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, utilizing advanced genome sequencing techniques to enhance patient education and understanding of genomic medicine. Lin investigates factors contributing to chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury, with particular attention to drug interactions and environmental influences, including exposure to pollutants and the impact of COVID-19 on renal health. His studies on cellular processes, including autophagy and mitochondrial dynamics, shed light on the underlying mechanisms of kidney injury and potential therapeutic interventions. Overall, Lin's research contributes significantly to nephrology by integrating genetic insights and clinical practices to improve diagnosis, management, and referral processes in renal disorders.
