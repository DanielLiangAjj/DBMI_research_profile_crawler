Researcher: Jared Kushner
Research Overview:
Jared Kushner's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focused on cardiovascular physiology, specifically the roles of calcium channels and signaling mechanisms in the development of cardiomyopathies and heart failure. His work involves utilizing advanced techniques such as mass spectrometry and protein interaction mapping to explore phosphorylation processes that influence cardiac muscle function and excitation-contraction coupling. Furthermore, his studies involve the use of transgenic mice and in vitro models, including HEK293 cells, to assess the effects of phosphodiesterase inhibitors like everolimus, and their interactions with adrenergic agents within the sympathetic nervous system. This body of work not only sheds light on the molecular underpinnings of cardiac arrhythmias but also extends into clinical considerations such as patient satisfaction in surgical settings, linking the physiological insights gained with practical applications in fields like orthopedic and plastic surgery. Overall, Kushnerâ€™s research intertwines fundamental cardiac biology with translational implications, aimed at improving patient outcomes in both cardiovascular health and surgical interventions.
