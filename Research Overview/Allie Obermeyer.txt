Researcher: Allie Obermeyer
Research Overview:
Allie Obermeyer's research centers around the biophysical properties and functional implications of biomolecular condensates, particularly those that arise from complex coacervation and phase separation phenomena. A significant focus is placed on intrinsically disordered proteins, antimicrobial peptides like LL-37 and crotamine, and their roles in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. The research explores how these proteins form membraneless organelles, leading to insights into protein aggregation, self-assembly, and the thermodynamics involved in these processes. Additionally, Obermeyer's work extends to innovative applications in biosensors, enzyme immobilization using block copolymers, and the development of nanostructures through bioconjugation techniques, including click chemistry. Overall, the research contributes to a deeper understanding of protein dynamics and their potential therapeutic applications through the manipulation of molecular interactions and structures.
