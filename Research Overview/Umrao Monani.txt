Researcher: Umrao Monani
Research Overview:
Umrao Monani's research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons leading to muscle atrophy. His work emphasizes the role of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein and its interaction with SNARE complex assembly as crucial factors in neurodegeneration. Utilizing various mouse models, including transgenic and knockout strains, Monani investigates the implications of genetic mutations and modifications on motor neuron health and functionality. His studies cover a broader range of neurological disorders, including DYT1 dystonia and Glut1 Deficiency Syndrome, exploring therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy and ketogenic diets. By integrating insights from neurology, genetics, and nutrition, Monani aims to develop effective interventions for these monogenic diseases, ultimately contributing to the advancement of treatment strategies for affected children and adults.
