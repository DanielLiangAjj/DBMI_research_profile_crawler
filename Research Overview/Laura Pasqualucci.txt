Researcher: Laura Pasqualucci
Research Overview:
Laura Pasqualucci's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms underlying B-cell lymphomas, particularly emphasizing epigenetic dysregulation, genetic alterations, and immune evasion. Her work extensively investigates the role of germinal center dynamics and somatic hypermutation in lymphomagenesis, utilizing mouse models and single-cell analyses to explore key genetic factors such as CREBBP, KMT2D, and MEF2B. By integrating advanced genomic and epigenomic methodologies, her studies seek to elucidate the tumor microenvironment's influence on B-cell receptor signaling and the progression of various lymphoma subtypes, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Additionally, Pasqualucci's findings on acetylation and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways provide insights into potential therapeutic targets, reflecting a commitment to addressing unmet medical needs in the field of hematologic malignancies. Overall, her research significantly contributes to the understanding of lymphoma biology and the development of precision medicine strategies for improved clinical outcomes.
