Researcher: Xiao Xu
Research Overview:
Xiao Xuâ€™s research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focusing on liver-related diseases, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma, as well as the impacts of liver transplantation and the associated surgical outcomes and survival rates. The researcher has investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying liver regeneration and the role of inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy in liver diseases. Notably, studies involve the examination of biomarkers, immune cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment, and the implications of therapeutic interventions, including immunotherapy and targeted drug delivery systems. Additionally, Xiao Xu has contributed to understanding the impacts of environmental factors, such as radiation exposure from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, on public health perceptions and long-term recovery processes. By employing multi-omics approaches and methodologies like Mendelian randomization and machine learning, the research findings aim to pave the way for improved prognostic models and more effective treatment strategies in the management of liver cancer and associated conditions. The wide-ranging implications of this work not only enhance the understanding of hepatic pathology but also inform clinical practices essential for improving patient outcomes.
