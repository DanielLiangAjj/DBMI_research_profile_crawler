Researcher: Piero Dalerba
Research Overview:
Piero Dalerba's research focuses on the multifaceted interactions between obesity, early-onset colorectal cancer, and various tumorigenic processes, with a particular emphasis on the role of cancer stem cells, microRNAs, and cell differentiation. His work investigates the molecular underpinnings of colorectal and breast cancers, exploring factors such as the WNT signaling pathway and the influence of the tumor microenvironment. Dalerba utilizes advanced methodologies, including organoid models and nanocarriers for targeted chemotherapy, to enhance therapeutic outcomes. His research also delves into the implications of lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption and obesity, as significant risk factors in carcinogenesis, contributing to the understanding of tumor biology and stem cell dynamics. By integrating insights from human and animal studies, Dalerba aims to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets that could improve prevention and treatment strategies for these prevalent malignancies.
