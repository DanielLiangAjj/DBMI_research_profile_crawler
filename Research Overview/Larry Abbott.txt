Researcher: Larry Abbott
Research Overview:
Larry Abbott's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationship between neuronal circuits and behavior, particularly in the context of learning and memory processes. Utilizing *Drosophila melanogaster* as a model organism, he investigates the role of dopamine in modulating cognitive functions and how neuronal dynamics influence decision-making and behavioral responses. His work emphasizes the significance of brain structures such as mushroom bodies and employs advanced techniques like brain mapping and computational modeling to elucidate the connectome and synaptic mechanisms underlying these processes. Through a multidisciplinary approach that spans neuroscience, computational biology, and behavioral analysis, Abbott aims to unravel the complex networks that govern cognition and memory, contributing valuable insights into both animal and human neuroscience.
