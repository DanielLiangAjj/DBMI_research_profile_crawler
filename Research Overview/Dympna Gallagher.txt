Researcher: Dympna Gallagher
Research Overview:
Dympna Gallagher's research focuses on the intersection of maternal health, obesity, and body composition, with a notable emphasis on the perinatal period and its impact on childrenâ€™s environmental health and obesity risk. Through various methodologies such as quantitative magnetic resonance, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and bioelectrical impedance analysis, Gallagher investigates the determinants of adiposity and body composition in both infants and adults. Her work extends to studying the implications of prenatal exposures, dietary patterns (including ultra-processed foods), and physical activity levels on maternal gestational weight gain and subsequent child health outcomes. Gallagher also explores the epidemiological relationships between obesity, type 2 diabetes, and lifestyle factors, placing special emphasis on disparities among diverse populations, including African American and Dominican cohorts. Furthermore, her research includes clinical trials aimed at understanding lifestyle modifications and interventions to mitigate risks associated with obesity and related comorbidities in both mothers and children. Overall, Gallagher's contributions significantly advance the understanding of how maternal factors and early-life interventions can shape long-term health trajectories in children, particularly in the context of rising obesity rates and associated health concerns.
