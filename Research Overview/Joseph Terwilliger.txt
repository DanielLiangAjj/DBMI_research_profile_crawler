Researcher: Joseph Terwilliger
Research Overview:
Joseph Terwilliger's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily focused on bioinformatics, genomics, and public health, particularly within the context of aging populations and chronic diseases. His work includes the analysis of differentially expressed genes through RNA-seq and next-generation sequencing techniques, shedding light on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and the genetic landscape of Kazakh populations. A substantial part of his studies investigates cardiovascular health, notably concerning hypertension, blood pressure monitoring, and associated risks among various demographics, including vulnerable populations in Venezuela and among Hispanic communities. Additionally, he delves into the intricate relationships between physical activity, body composition, energy availability, and their implications for cardiometabolic diseases. His research also highlights the significance of biomarkers, aging mechanisms, and the genetic predisposition to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease, emphasizing a comprehensive approach to understanding health challenges faced by different populations. In summary, Terwilliger’s work significantly contributes to the fields of genomics, chronic disease epidemiology, and the intersection of genetic and environmental factors in population health, with an emphasis on actionable insights into public health management and disease prevention strategies.
