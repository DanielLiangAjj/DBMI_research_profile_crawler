Researcher: Chaolin Zhang
Research Overview:
Chaolin Zhang's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on RNA splicing regulation, specifically how RNA-binding proteins influence alternative splicing in various contexts, including neuronal development and cancer. His work highlights mechanisms related to tau proteins and their mutations associated with tauopathies, as well as the role of alternative splicing in neurodevelopmental disorders like autism. Zhang employs advanced computational techniques such as deep learning and network inference to predict splicing outcomes, integrating machine learning in the analysis of complex biological datasets like single-cell RNA sequencing. He also explores the implications of alternative splicing in breast cancer, aiming to improve prognosis through innovative biomarkers and treatment strategies, including studies on autophagy and immune responses in tumors. Overall, Zhang's research contributes significantly to understanding the intricacies of RNA biology, tumor microenvironments, and the evolution of the primate brain, bridging gaps between molecular biology, clinical applications, and developmental neuroscience.
