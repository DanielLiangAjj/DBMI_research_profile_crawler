Researcher: Stephen P. Goff
Research Overview:
Stephen P. Goff's research focuses on the intricate interplay between viral mechanisms, particularly those of retroviruses like HIV-1 and various host factors, elucidating how these interactions influence viral replication, transcriptional regulation, and immune responses. His work delves into the role of histones, histone modifications, and chromatin structure in viral infections and gene silencing, particularly regarding unintegrated retroviral DNAs. Additionally, Goff explores the host dependency factors that affect HIV-1, as well as the antiviral mechanisms that involve innate immunity and protein-protein interactions. He also investigates the impact of specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and other cofactors on viral processes. His studies span from molecular mechanisms that govern retrovirus restriction to the effects of histone deposition in RNA binding and transcriptional silencing, contributing valuable insights into understanding viral behaviors and potential therapeutic targets, especially in the context of drug resistance observed in COVID-19 and HIV-related conditions.Overall, Goff's research advances our understanding of retroviruses and their interactions with host cellular processes, paving the way for potential new strategies in treating viral infections and their associated diseases.
