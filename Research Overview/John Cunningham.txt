Researcher: John Cunningham
Research Overview:
John Cunningham's research is characterized by a focus on behavioral addictions, particularly concerning substance use disorders such as alcohol and cannabis, and their treatment using modern digital interventions. His studies frequently employ randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of smartphone applications and brief online interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to improve outcomes related to depression, comorbidity with substance use, and overall quality of life. Additionally, Cunningham explores social determinants of health that impact substance use behaviors and engages with populations such as adolescents and university students in his research. By integrating methodologies from fields like epidemiology, cognitive psychology, and health economics, he aims to create accessible, evidence-based strategies for addiction treatment that leverage technology. His work has extensively shed light on innovative intervention techniques such as motivational interviewing, self-help strategies, and mobile health applications, thereby contributing significantly to public health initiatives aimed at reducing the prevalence of hazardous alcohol and drug use.
