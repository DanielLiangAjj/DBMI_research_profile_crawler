Researcher: Karthik Natarajan
Research Overview:
Karthik Natarajan's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focused on leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) to enhance patient outcomes and expand participation in biomedical research. A significant portion of his work is dedicated to understanding the implications of COVID-19 and vaccinations, particularly in underrepresented populations, emphasizing the importance of precision medicine and data quality. He investigates the epidemiology of acute coronary syndrome and longitudinal outcomes of interventions such as primary percutaneous coronary intervention while addressing challenges related to data integration and measurement error. Furthermore, his research spans mental health, exploring the burden of anxiety and mood disorders among adults, as well as the efficacy of vaccinations against infectious diseases, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2. By integrating methodologies from data science and machine learning, Natarajan aims to improve health services accessibility and outcomes, advocating for open science and collaborative analysis within the healthcare ecosystem. Overall, his contributions significantly advance our understanding of clinical and public health issues faced by diverse populations during critical health crises.
