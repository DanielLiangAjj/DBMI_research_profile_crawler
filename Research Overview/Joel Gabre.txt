Researcher: Joel Gabre
Research Overview:
Joel Gabre's research primarily focuses on the intersection of oncology and cell biology, with particular attention on the mechanisms underlying various forms of esophageal and gastric cancers. His work explores the implications of genetic mutations, such as the germline CDH1 mutation, in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, and the effectiveness of prophylactic gastrectomy. Utilizing advanced methodologies, including 3D organoids derived from patient tissues, Gabre's research aims to personalize cancer therapies by developing patient-derived organoids that mimic tumor environments. His studies further delve into the roles of extracellular matrix components and immune cell interactions, particularly CD4 and CD8 T cells, in the tumor microenvironment. By integrating techniques like CRISPR/Cas9 and Nucleofection, his investigations assess the regenerative capabilities of gastric organoids and potential treatments for precancerous conditions, such as Barrett's esophagus. Overall, Gabreâ€™s contributions to the fields of cancer biology and personalized medicine are significant, emphasizing the need for innovative therapeutic strategies tailored to individual patients' genetic and biological profiles.
