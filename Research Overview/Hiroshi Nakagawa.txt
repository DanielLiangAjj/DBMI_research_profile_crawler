Researcher: Hiroshi Nakagawa
Research Overview:
Hiroshi Nakagawa's research focuses extensively on the intersection of cardiac electrophysiology, cancer biology, and advanced therapeutic techniques, especially in the context of arrhythmias and esophageal cancers. His work investigates innovative approaches to tackle atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia using catheter ablation techniques, including cryoballoon and radiofrequency methods, while also exploring the underlying mechanisms of DNA damage and cellular responses in cancer through in vitro models and 3D organoids. Nakagawa emphasizes the implications of oxidative stress, immune evasion, and tumor microenvironment factors in the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. His studies incorporate the use of advanced imaging techniques, molecular dynamics simulation, and the application of bioassays to understand the effectiveness of therapies like erythropoietin in enhancing cellular resilience against oxidative damage. Overall, his research contributes significantly to the development of personalized and effective treatment strategies for both cardiac and oncological conditions, highlighting the complex interplay between these two fields.
