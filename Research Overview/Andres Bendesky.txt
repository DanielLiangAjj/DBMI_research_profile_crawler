Researcher: Andres Bendesky
Research Overview:
Andres Bendesky's research encompasses a broad range of topics primarily centered on the interplay between genetics and behavior in animal models, particularly focusing on brain evolution in species like the deer mouse (Peromyscus) and betta fish. His work delves into gene expression and regulation, exploring how genetic variation influences animal behavior and social interactions, including mating and paternal behaviors. Utilizing advanced genetic manipulation techniques such as CRISPR and the Tol2 system, Bendesky examines the functional consequences of specific genetic traits on behavior through methods like genome editing, transgenesis, and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. The implications of inbreeding, pedigree reconstruction, and population genetics are integral to his studies on behavioral genetics and domestication, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms driving evolutionary changes in animals. Overall, Bendesky's research contributes significantly to our understanding of the genetic and neuroendocrine foundations of behavioral evolution, shedding light on how molecular and genetic factors shape social behavior across species.
