Researcher: Rando Allikmets
Research Overview:
Rando Allikmets has extensively researched inherited maculopathies, particularly focusing on ABCA4-associated retinopathies such as Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration. His work encompasses the exploration of deep-intronic variants and their implications for penetrance in genetic diseases. Through methodologies like single-cell sequencing, long-read sequencing, and systems genomics, he investigates genetic variations and their contributions to retinal diseases. Allikmets's research also delves into the clinical applications of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for therapy, emphasizing the role of the complement system and lipid transport mechanisms in retinal degeneration. His findings aim to address challenges such as missing heritability and allelic heterogeneity in inherited retinal dystrophies, providing insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies. Overall, Allikmetsâ€™s contributions significantly advance the understanding of genetic influences in ophthalmology and the development of targeted treatments for retinal diseases.
