Researcher: Andrew Marks
Research Overview:
Andrew Marks' research primarily focuses on the role of calcium signaling and its regulation within various cellular contexts, particularly as it relates to cardiac and muscular diseases. His work extensively investigates the structure and function of ryanodine receptors, essential calcium release channels located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which are crucial for excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Marks employs advanced techniques such as cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) for detailed structural analysis, alongside induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to model heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy, and congenital myopathies. His studies also address the implications of oxidative stress and post-translational modifications in calcium homeostasis and cellular senescence, providing insights into aging and associated cardiovascular pathologies. Furthermore, his research engages with therapeutic avenues for congenital myopathies and arrhythmias, emphasizing drug screening and the identification of biomarkers for these conditions. Collectively, his contributions enhance the understanding of calcium dynamics, muscular dystrophies, and cardiac function, ultimately aiming for improved diagnostics and therapeutic strategies in cardiovascular and neuromuscular health.
