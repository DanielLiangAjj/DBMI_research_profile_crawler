Researcher: Stavroula Kousteni
Research Overview:
Stavroula Kousteni's research primarily explores the intersection of bone biology, energy metabolism, and neuroendocrine regulation, with a significant focus on the roles of Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) and the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in appetite regulation and metabolic processes. Her work employs advanced mouse models to investigate the implications of these components in various conditions such as obesity, osteoporosis, and acute myeloid leukemia. Particularly, her studies examine how LCN2 influences appetite and energy homeostasis, emphasizing its anorexigenic effects. Additionally, Kousteni investigates the hematopoietic stem cell niche, the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, and the interplay of osteoblasts in bone health. Through a comprehensive exploration of these mechanisms, her research contributes valuable insights into the biological factors affecting bone density, appetite regulation, and the implications of metabolic disorders, ultimately aiming to inform therapeutic strategies in medicine.
