Researcher: Anna-Lena Steckelberg
Research Overview:
Anna-Lena Steckelberg's research is centered on the complex interplay between RNA biology and host-virus interactions, particularly in the context of various viral pathogens. Her work delves into critical mechanisms such as ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, RNAylation processes, and the structural nuances of viral RNAs, leveraging advanced techniques such as X-ray crystallography and single-molecule FRET to elucidate these interactions. A significant focus lies on the regulation of translation, RNA stability, and post-translational modifications, including the roles of exoribonucleases and RNA-binding proteins. Steckelberg's contributions extend to examining the effects of viral nonstructural proteins and understanding how viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and Zika manipulate host cellular mechanisms, influencing gene expression and RNA splicing. By shedding light on these fundamental processes, her research provides valuable insights into RNA dynamics and their implications for viral pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies.
