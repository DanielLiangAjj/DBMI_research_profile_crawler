Researcher: Mary Gamble
Research Overview:
Mary Gamble's research primarily focuses on the interplay between environmental arsenic exposure and nutritional factors, particularly folic acid and other one-carbon metabolism nutrients. Her work emphasizes the importance of arsenic methylation processes, biomarkers, and their implications for metabolic health, cognitive function, and epigenetic changes, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children and adolescents in Bangladesh. She investigates the impact of dietary components, such as folate and B-vitamins, on arsenic metabolism and associated health outcomes, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, her research explores the role of oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA methylation in chronic diseases linked to arsenic exposure, analyzing how nutritional status and genetic factors can modify these risks. Through various methodologies, including metabolomics and long-term cohort studies, Gamble's work contributes to a deeper understanding of how environmental contaminants can affect health and highlights potential dietary interventions to mitigate negative impacts, thereby addressing both individual and public health challenges.
