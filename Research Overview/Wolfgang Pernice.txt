Researcher: Wolfgang Pernice
Research Overview:
Wolfgang Pernice's research focuses on the intricate relationship between genetics, cellular biology, and mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in the context of genetic diseases and lifespan regulation. His work delves into molecular pathology, emphasizing the roles of organelle contact sites and asymmetric cell division as key factors influencing cellular aging and longevity. Utilizing model organisms such as budding yeast, he explores the impact of mitochondrial function on cellular processes, including DNA replication, signaling pathways, and the cellular response to stress. Pernice's investigations into mitochondrial diseases leverage a variety of experimental approaches, from genetic complementation tests to fluorescence microscopy, to uncover the underlying mechanisms governing cell polarity and senescence. Overall, his research contributes to a deeper understanding of how mitochondrial health and genetic factors interact to affect lifespan and cellular viability in both model organisms and humans.
