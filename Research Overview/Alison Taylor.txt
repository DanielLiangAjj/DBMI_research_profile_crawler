Researcher: Alison Taylor
Research Overview:
Alison Taylor's research extensively investigates critical areas of human health and disease, particularly focusing on cancer biology, immunotherapy, chronic diseases, and public health approaches. A significant portion of her work explores the mechanisms and implications of aneuploidy and chromosomal instability in various cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, utilizing advanced genomic and proteomic techniques. Her studies delve into the effects of human papillomavirus on neoplastic transformations and the role of immune checkpoints in cancer immunotherapy, identifying biomarkers that are pivotal for treatment strategies. Additionally, Taylor addresses critical issues in chronic diseases, including renal pathology and inflammatory bowel disorders, examining the psychosocial impacts of these conditions on quality of life and caregiver burden. Her interdisciplinary approach integrates findings from cellular functions, public health policy, and patient-reported outcomes, with a strong emphasis on improving healthcare practices and informing clinical guidelines. In sum, Taylor's multifaceted research contributes significantly to both the understanding of disease mechanisms and the enhancement of health outcomes through innovative and culturally competent care strategies.
