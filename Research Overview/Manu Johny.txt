Researcher: Manu Johny
Research Overview:
Manu Johny’s research primarily focuses on the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing the function of ion channels, particularly voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, in relation to cardiac physiology and disease. Utilizing advanced techniques such as mass spectrometry, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and cryoelectron microscopy, Johny investigates post-translational modifications (PTM), including ubiquitination and phosphorylation, and their roles in regulating ion channel activity and proteostasis. His studies delve into pathophysiological conditions such as cardiac arrhythmias, long QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome, emphasizing the intricate relationship between these channels and excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes. By elucidating the stoichiometry, gating mechanisms, and regulatory interactions of these channels—often influenced by proteins like calmodulin and the NEDD4 E3 ligases—Johny contributes to a deeper understanding of cardiovascular function and potential therapeutic targets for heart diseases.
