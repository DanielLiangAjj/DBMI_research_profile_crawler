Researcher: Joan Bathon
Research Overview:
Joan Bathonâ€™s research primarily focuses on the intricate relationship between autoimmune diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Her extensive investigation highlights the associations of inflammation, lipids, and specific biomarkers such as serum amyloid A and interleukin-6, alongside the impact of various treatments including disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), on heart conditions and risk factors. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) and hybrid imaging, her work emphasizes the cardiovascular risks inherent in RA, as evidenced by coronary artery calcification, heart failure, and vascular remodeling. Moreover, Bathon's research encompasses the epidemiological aspects of these diseases, exploring incidence and prevalence within diverse populations. Through a multidisciplinary approach that includes molecular biology, computational modeling, and clinical epidemiology, she aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how underlying autoimmune mechanisms contribute to cardiovascular pathology, ultimately informing better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for at-risk populations.
