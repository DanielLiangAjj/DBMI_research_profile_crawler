Researcher: Sviatlana Samovich N
Research Overview:
Sviatlana Samovich's research focuses on the biochemical mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Central to her studies are various phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylethanolamine and lipoxygenases, which play critical roles in cellular responses to oxidative stress and inflammation. Her work highlights the implications of ferroptosis in diseases such as cancer, asthma, and infectious diseases like COVID-19, as well as its potential applications in tumor suppression and therapeutic strategies. Utilizing advanced techniques such as mass spectrometry and redox lipidomics, she investigates the role of lipid metabolism and oxidative processes in disease models, emphasizing the importance of mitochondrial dynamics and the immune response. Overall, her research contributes to a deeper understanding of how lipid peroxidation and cellular signaling pathways dictate cell fate in health and disease contexts, paving the way for innovative treatment approaches targeting ferroptosis and its related metabolic pathways.
