Researcher: Paul Garcia
Research Overview:
Paul Garcia's research primarily focuses on the intersection of anesthesia, cognitive impairment, and neurophysiological monitoring, utilizing a variety of models including rodents and human subjects. His studies emphasize the critical aspects of intraoperative and postoperative care, exploring the effects of different anesthetic agents such as isoflurane, propofol, and sevoflurane on brain activity as measured by electroencephalography (EEG). He investigates the implications of anesthesia on cognitive function, particularly delirium and postoperative complications in elderly populations. Garcia's work also examines innovative monitoring techniques and the physiological mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction amidst surgical contexts, utilizing neuroimaging and electrophysiological measures. Additionally, he delves into the impact of physical activity and prehabilitation on anesthesia outcomes and recovery. Through rigorous prospective studies and randomized controlled trials, Garcia contributes significantly to advancing the understanding of anesthesia's effects on cognitive health and the development of protocols aimed at minimizing risks associated with surgical procedures.
