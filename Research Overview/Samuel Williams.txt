Researcher: Samuel Williams
Research Overview:
Samuel Williams' research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily centered around public health, immunology, cancer biology, and environmental health. His work delves deeply into HIV disease, particularly as it affects youths in Sierra Leone, exploring the implications of antiretroviral therapy and CD4 cell counts in disease progression. He also investigates hidradenitis suppurativa's inflammatory processes, emphasizing the role of microbiome interactions and specific cytokines like IL-17 and TNF in disease pathology. Additionally, his research touches upon the ecological and migratory patterns of marine species, such as sharks and billfish, linking these behaviors to broader environmental and conservation efforts. Williams has also contributed to the understanding of kidney cancers through advancements in imaging and surgical outcomes, alongside examining the impacts of natural gas exposure on public health within various contexts. His interdisciplinary approach combines insights from genomics, environmental science, and clinical medicine, marking significant strides in addressing complex health and ecological challenges.
