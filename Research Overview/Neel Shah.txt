Researcher: Neel Shah
Research Overview:
Dr. Neel Shah's research encompasses a broad and multidisciplinary exploration of maternal and child health, health disparities, and innovative healthcare solutions utilizing digital technologies and data analytics. His work addresses critical components such as the effects of pregnancy-related factors, the implementation of community health initiatives involving doulas, and the examination of maternal health outcomes within diverse populations, particularly focusing on African American communities and addressing social determinants of health. His investigations extend into the realms of digital health, telemedicine, and value-based care, emphasizing the importance of patient-centered approaches in maternal health services. Dr. Shah is also engaged in advancing understanding of complex biomedical phenomena, such as the implications of various medications (including atorvastatin) on health outcomes, the role of signaling pathways in disease processes, and the evolution of therapeutic strategies for complex health conditions, such as cancer and infectious diseases. By integrating qualitative and quantitative research methods, his contributions substantially inform clinical guidelines and healthcare policies aimed at improving quality and access to care, particularly in underserved communities during critical stages of care, including prenatal and postpartum periods.
