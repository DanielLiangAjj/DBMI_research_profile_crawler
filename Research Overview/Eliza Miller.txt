Researcher: Eliza Miller
Research Overview:
Eliza Miller's research spans a broad spectrum of topics primarily focused on cardiovascular health, particularly concerning women during pregnancy and postpartum periods. A substantial portion of her work examines the impacts of conditions like preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders on the risk of stroke, including both ischemic and hemorrhagic types. Her studies also delve into the epidemiology of these cardiovascular diseases among young adults, with particular attention to sex differences and racial disparities in outcomes. Additionally, Miller's work addresses the intersection of pregnancy complications with cognitive health, exploring how factors such as obesity, body mass index, and maternal age contribute to long-term neurological outcomes like dementia. She investigates the adverse effects of infections, including COVID-19, on maternal morbidity and stroke incidence, further emphasizing the need for preventive strategies in maternal healthcare. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, her research aims to improve understanding of the multifactorial risks associated with cerebrovascular disorders during and after pregnancy, ultimately contributing to enhanced clinical approaches and health outcomes for women across diverse populations.
