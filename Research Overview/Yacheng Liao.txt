Researcher: Yacheng Liao
Research Overview:
Yacheng Liao's research focuses on the intricate interplay between lysosomes, peroxisomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within cellular environments, particularly under conditions of stress and neurodegeneration. His investigations delve into the mechanisms of cellular transport, particularly in relation to cholesterols, very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), and their association with disorders such as adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). By employing advanced techniques like FIB-SEM and in vitro reconstitution assays, Liao explores the dynamics of organelle contact sites, including lysosome-peroxisome interactions and the roles of channel and transport proteins such as ATP-binding cassette transporters and ESCRTs. His studies illuminate the significance of local translation, autophagy, and the phosphoinositide signaling pathway (PI(4,5)P2) in cellular homeostasis and the modulation of transcriptional regulation under varying physiological conditions. Overall, Liao's work enhances our understanding of cellular stress responses and their implications for neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders, contributing to the broader field of cellular biology and potential therapeutic strategies.
