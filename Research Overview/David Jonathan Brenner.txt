Researcher: David Jonathan Brenner
Research Overview:
David Jonathan Brenner's research encompasses a wide array of themes primarily centered on radiation biology, dosimetry, and biosecurity, with particular applications in cancer treatment and infectious disease control, including COVID-19. His work integrates biophysical modeling and advanced technologies such as film dosimetry and imaging flow cytometry to assess radiation exposure and its biological effects, particularly focusing on mechanisms of DNA damage and repair, which are critical in understanding radiation-induced leukemogenesis and other neoplasms. Furthermore, Brenner is investigating the efficacy of germicidal ultraviolet light, specifically far-UVC radiation, in combating airborne pathogens in indoor environments. His research includes rigorous evaluations of biodosimetry techniques as a means to assess radiation exposure in various contexts, including space health and emergency response scenarios during pandemics. Leveraging multi-omics approaches, his studies dive deep into the metabolomic and proteomic profiles associated with radiation exposure and repair, contributing to the fields of precision medicine and risk estimation. Overall, Brenner's multifaceted research addresses significant challenges in radiation therapy, disaster preparedness, and public health, affirming the vital connection between radiobiology and clinical applications.
