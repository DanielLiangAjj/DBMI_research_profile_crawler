Researcher: Simone Sanna-Cherchi
Research Overview:
Simone Sanna-Cherchi's research primarily focuses on genetic factors influencing various kidney diseases, particularly congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). Utilizing advanced genomic techniques such as whole exome sequencing (WES) and copy number variation (CNV) analysis, Sanna-Cherchi investigates the genetic underpinnings of these conditions, seeking to elucidate monogenic disease causation and the role of genetic modifiers like APOL1 and DSTYK. The researcher employs diverse model systems, including mouse models and zebrafish, to explore renal developmental genetics and the intersection of neurological and kidney disease phenotypes. By integrating findings from genomics and cell biology, their work aims to enhance genetic diagnosis, improve patient care in pediatric nephrology, and unravel the complex genetic architecture underlying chronic kidney diseases while also addressing the feasibility and workflow of genetic testing in clinical settings. Overall, Sanna-Cherchi's contributions significantly advance our understanding of genetic kidney disorders, paving the way for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
