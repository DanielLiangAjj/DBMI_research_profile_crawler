Researcher: Anum Glasgow
Research Overview:
Anum Glasgow's research focuses on the intricate interactions between host and viral mechanisms, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, including the Omicron strain. Her work extensively explores RNA structure and the regulation of translation, highlighting pivotal roles for the ACE2 receptor, host shutoff strategies, and host-pathogen interactions. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), computational design, and protein engineering, she investigates the development of antiviral therapeutics and protein therapeutics, aiming to enhance pseudovirus neutralization and create receptor traps. Furthermore, her research spans into the realms of biomineralization and microbial electrocatalysis, where she examines nanowires and protein secretion, especially through type III secretion systems in pathogens like Salmonella. By combining insights from molecular biology and nanotechnology, Glasgow endeavors to innovate therapeutic approaches to combat viral infections and enhance our understanding of virulence mechanisms through disparate yet interconnected research strands.
