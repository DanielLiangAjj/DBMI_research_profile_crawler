Researcher: Daniel Javitt
Research Overview:
Daniel Javitt's research primarily focuses on the complexities of cognitive and perceptual processes in psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia and related conditions such as bipolar disorder and depression. His work investigates the relationship between neurophysiological mechanisms—particularly involving NMDA receptors, glutamate, and dopamine—and their impact on cognition and sensory processing. A significant aspect of his research includes the analysis of eye movement patterns and auditory processing, exploring how these factors relate to cognitive dysfunction and psychotic symptoms. He employs advanced neuroimaging techniques, including fMRI and EEG, to examine functional connectivity and brain oscillations, aiming to identify biomarkers of mental disorders. Additionally, Javitt's studies on therapeutic interventions, such as transcranial direct current stimulation and pharmacological treatments, aim to enhance clinical outcomes for individuals with severe mental health issues. Overall, his work contributes to a deeper understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of schizophrenia and the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.
