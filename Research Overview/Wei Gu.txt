Researcher: Wei Gu
Research Overview:
Wei Gu's research encompasses a broad range of critical topics in health and disease, with a particular emphasis on cancer biology, immune response mechanisms, and metabolic disorders. His work investigates the intricate roles of iron metabolism and ferroptosis in cancer development, exploring how these processes affect glioblastoma and other tumors. Additionally, Gu has delved into the effects of ischemia/reperfusion on cellular death and neurodegeneration, while also examining the innate immune response to viral infections such as enterovirus-related diseases and their evasion strategies. His studies on dietary behaviors and gut microbiota further address the connections between metabolic dysfunction and inflammation. Beyond cancer and metabolism, Gu's research also covers the implications of traditional Chinese medicine, the pharmacological properties of various herbal substances, and the integration of advanced methodologies like CRISPR and machine learning in biomedical research. His comprehensive approach and interdisciplinary focus aim to unveil innovative therapeutic strategies and enhance understanding of complex disease mechanisms, contributing significantly to the fields of oncology, immunology, and molecular biology.
