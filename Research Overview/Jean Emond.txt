Researcher: Jean Emond
Research Overview:
Jean Emond's research primarily focuses on living donor liver transplantation, examining outcomes, predictors of success, and associated complications such as bile leaks and biliary strictures. His work delves into the nuances of liver transplantation, investigating key factors like ultra-low graft-to-recipient weight ratios (GRWR), the role of T regulatory cells in immune regulation, and the impact of biliary complications on postoperative outcomes. Emond's studies also address the epidemiology of liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, looking at the effectiveness of surgical techniques and treatments such as loco-regional therapy. Furthermore, his research explores the implications of viral infections, particularly hepatitis B and C, in transplant scenarios, and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic for transplant recipients. Emondâ€™s comprehensive approach integrates aspects of donor selection, patient care, and the ethical dimensions of organ donation, contributing significantly to both clinical practice and medical education in this vital field. Overall, his research underscores the complexities of liver transplantation and aims to enhance patient outcomes through informed clinical practices and innovative treatment methodologies.
