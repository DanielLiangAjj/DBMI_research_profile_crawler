Researcher: Gregg Gundersen
Research Overview:
Gregg Gundersen's research focuses on the intricate relationships between the cytoskeleton, nuclear mechanics, and mechanotransduction in various cellular contexts. Key areas of investigation include axon outgrowth, neuronal polarity, and cellular response to mechanical stimuli, with a particular emphasis on the roles of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, actin filaments, and microtubules in these processes. Gundersen's work explores molecular interactions involving formins, specifically FHOD1, and their contributions to actin bundling, as well as the impact of RhoA signaling in cell movement and morphology. His studies further delve into nuclear envelope dynamics, including the involvement of nesprin proteins in nuclear positioning and movement, and the implications of structural proteins such as lamins in diseases like Hutchinsonâ€“Gilford progeria syndrome and various cardiomyopathies. The overarching theme of Gundersen's research is to elucidate how cytoskeletal organization and mechanics affect cellular functions and their contributions to pathophysiological conditions.
