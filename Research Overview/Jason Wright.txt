Researcher: Jason Wright
Research Overview:
Jason Wright's research primarily focuses on gynecologic malignancies, including cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer, as well as their implications on women's health within various socio-economic contexts. His studies examine a range of critical areas such as cancer prevention, screening protocols, access to health care, treatment outcomes, and healthcare disparities among different ethnic groups. Wright's work highlights the impact of socio-economic factors and systemic barriers on cancer management, particularly during pregnancy. He explores advanced therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy, neoadjuvant therapies, and the integration of novel targeted agents. Additionally, he addresses the complexities of treatment decision-making amidst evolving challenges posed by public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. By leveraging machine learning and extensive data analysis, his contributions aim to improve prognostic models, optimize surgical procedures, and ultimately enhance survivorship outcomes for cancer patients.
