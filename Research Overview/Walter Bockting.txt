Researcher: Walter Bockting
Research Overview:
Walter Bockting's research primarily focuses on the health and well-being of sexual and gender minorities, particularly transgender and nonbinary individuals. His work addresses significant issues such as mental health, healthcare accessibility, stigma, and health disparities, while paying close attention to the intersecting effects of socioeconomic factors and minority stress on this population's overall health outcomes. Bockting's investigations examine the impacts of discrimination and internalized transphobia, exploring experiences related to suicidal ideation, substance use, and self-injurious behaviors among transgender individuals. He emphasizes the importance of gender-affirming medical care and effective patient-provider relationships, aiming to foster resilience and enhance patient satisfaction. His research utilizes qualitative methodologies and diverse population samples, including insights from both urban and rural contexts. By advocating for informed public policy and improved healthcare practices, especially concerning HIV prevention through Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), Bockting's work significantly contributes to the understanding and improvement of health outcomes for sexual and gender minorities, highlighting the urgency of addressing the adverse effects of stigma and discrimination in clinical settings.
