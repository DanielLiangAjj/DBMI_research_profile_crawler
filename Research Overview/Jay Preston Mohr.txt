Researcher: Jay Preston Mohr
Research Overview:
Jay Preston Mohr's research primarily focuses on ischemic stroke, its classification, subtypes, management strategies, and associated complications such as hemorrhagic transformation. His work encompasses various aspects of vascular neurology, emphasizing acute ischemic stroke, its pathology, and outcomes related to treatment modalities like thrombolysis and anticoagulants, including the comparative effectiveness of aspirin and warfarin. He employs algorithms and scales, such as the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification, to refine stroke diagnoses and prognoses. Mohr's studies also delve into the long-term cognitive effects of ischemic stroke, exploring risk factors and the implications of comorbidities like heart failure and risk assessment within diverse patient demographics, including those affected by COVID-19. The cumulative insights from Mohr's research contribute significantly to the understanding and management of cerebrovascular disease, aiming to enhance patient care and outcomes following stroke events.
