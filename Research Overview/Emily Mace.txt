Researcher: Emily Mace
Research Overview:
Emily Mace's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics in cancer immunology, focusing particularly on the role and capabilities of natural killer (NK) cells within the immune system. Her work integrates aspects of innate immunity, cellular migration, and functionality of NK cell phenotypes in the context of cancer evasion and immunotherapy strategies. Mace explores advanced methodologies including data-driven analyses, phenomics, and unsupervised machine learning to characterize NK cell behavior, morphology, and interactions in various disease states, including pediatric conditions and responses to viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2. The research demonstrates a significant emphasis on understanding immune deficiencies, autoinflammatory disorders, and the implications of genetic variants in primary immunodeficiencies. Maceâ€™s contributions to knowledge surrounding NK cell signaling, cell adhesion mechanisms, and the immune microenvironment position her work at the forefront of developing precision medicine approaches and novel therapeutic interventions in cancer and immune-related diseases. Overall, her multifaceted approach aims to elucidate the complexities of immune regulation, enhance NK cell functionality, and improve outcomes in immunotherapy for patients.
