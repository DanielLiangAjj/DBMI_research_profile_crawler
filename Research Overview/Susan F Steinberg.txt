Researcher: Susan F Steinberg
Research Overview:
Susan F. Steinberg's research primarily focuses on the intricate mechanisms of cardiac physiology, particularly the roles of cardiomyocytes within the context of oxidative stress, proteolysis, and signal transduction pathways mediated by Î²1-adrenergic receptors. Her studies delve into the molecular dynamics involving protein kinases, glycosylation processes, and alternative splicing, pivotal for understanding cardiac development and anomalies. Utilizing models such as zebrafish and various rodent species, she investigates the effects of catecholamines on cardiomyocytes and their implications in heart failure. Her work addresses the pathophysiological aspects of myocardial remodeling, the interplay between oxidative stress and cardioprotection, and the influence of post-translational modifications on cardiac function. Through a combination of biochemical techniques and proteomics, Steinberg's research contributes valuable insights into cardiac health, disease mechanisms, and potential therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disorders.
