Researcher: Frank Provenzano
Research Overview:
Frank Provenzano's research primarily focuses on the intersection of neurology and cognitive science, exploring various aspects of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in relation to cognitive impairment, psychosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Utilizing advanced neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and EEG, his work investigates the underlying mechanisms of neurological disorders, including high-frequency oscillations, interictal discharges, and their impacts on brain function and behavior. Provenzano emphasizes the role of biomarkers and cognitive testing, aiming to understand the progression of conditions like epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia. His studies often incorporate machine learning and deep learning methods to enhance neuroimaging analysis, facilitating the identification of structural brain changes, such as atrophy and white matter hyperintensities. Overall, his contributions significantly advance the understanding of cognitive aging, neurodegeneration, and their societal implications, with the goal of improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis and other neurodegenerative disorders.
