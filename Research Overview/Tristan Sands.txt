Researcher: Tristan Sands
Research Overview:
Tristan Sands's research encompasses a wide range of topics primarily focused on pediatric neurology, particularly epilepsy and its associated genetic factors. His work explores various forms of epilepsy, including Rasmussen syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, and genetic variations in conditions like epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures. Utilizing advanced techniques such as exome sequencing and next-generation sequencing, Sands investigates the genetic underpinnings of these neurological disorders, examining the impact of specific gene mutations, such as KCNQ2 and CSNK2A1, on clinical outcomes. His studies also emphasize the role of adaptive functions and cognitive impairments associated with developmental disabilities in affected populations. Through cohort creation and analysis of clinical data, Sands integrates ethical considerations in genetic testing and precision medicine. Additionally, he addresses the optimization of treatment strategies for epilepsy through pharmacogenetics and individualized medical management. Ultimately, his research contributes to a better understanding of genetic epilepsy, aiming to enhance public health approaches and improve outcomes for pediatric patients facing these complex conditions.
