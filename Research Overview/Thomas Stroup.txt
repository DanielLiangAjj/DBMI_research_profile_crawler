Researcher: Thomas Stroup
Research Overview:
Thomas Stroup's research primarily focuses on the multifaceted aspects of schizophrenia and serious mental illnesses, with particular emphasis on treatment interventions and the effects of antipsychotic medications. His studies explore vital areas such as psychotropic drug adherence, public and self-stigma associated with mental illness, and the impact of structured treatment approaches, including coordinated specialty care and early intervention strategies. Stroup's work also delves into the intersection of mental health and physical health, examining factors such as aerobic fitness, neuroplasticity, and risk assessments related to violence and suicide among affected populations. His utilization of digital psychiatry tools, like smartphone applications, suggests a forward-thinking approach to integrating technology in mental health care. Overall, Stroup advocates for evidence-based practices that address stigma, enhance treatment adherence, and improve patient outcomes in mental health settings, particularly among diverse populations, including Hispanic communities.
