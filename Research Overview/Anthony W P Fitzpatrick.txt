Researcher: Anthony W P Fitzpatrick
Research Overview:
Anthony W. P. Fitzpatrick's research is centered on advanced cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques and their applications in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and corticobasal degeneration. His work involves innovative methodologies like cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), phase contrast imaging, and ultrafast electron microscopy, which facilitate the detailed visualization of protein aggregates, specifically tauopathies and amyloid fibrils. His investigations extend to the structural dynamics and post-translational modifications of proteins involved in endocytosis and receptor recycling, contributing to insights in visual proteomics and the neurobiology of proteinuria. Furthermore, Fitzpatrick explores the implications of these findings in a broader context of neurodegeneration and the pathophysiology of various tau-related disorders, employing techniques such as real-time quaking-induced conversion and microED to uncover the intricacies of protein behavior in health and disease. Through this integrated structural biology approach, his research aims to illuminate potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative conditions.
