Researcher: David Roh
Research Overview:
David Rohâ€™s research primarily focuses on the complexities surrounding intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and other cerebrovascular disorders. His work investigates various aspects of coagulation, outcomes from neurocritical care treatments, and the implementation of advanced technologies such as machine learning and electroencephalography to enhance prognostication and identify risk factors. Central to his studies is the exploration of components like thromboembolic conditions, imaging modalities including MRI, and innovative hemostatic assays like rotational thromboelastometry. Additionally, he analyzes how demographic variables, such as sex differences and ABO blood types, impact patient outcomes in both acute and chronic settings associated with brain injuries and strokes. His interdisciplinary approach integrates recent advancements in data science and critical care methodologies to evaluate treatment responses and enhance patient recovery trajectories, particularly in the context of systemic implications like COVID-19 and its neurological consequences.
