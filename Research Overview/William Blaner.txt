Researcher: William Blaner
Research Overview:
William Blaner's research primarily focuses on the interplay of retinoids and their associated proteins in metabolic diseases, particularly in the context of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular conditions such as diabetic cardiomyopathy and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Central to his work are enteroendocrine cells and their secretion of incretins like glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, which are critical for regulating insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. His studies also delve into the roles of various forms of vitamin A and retinol-binding proteins, particularly in linking retinoid signaling to cellular metabolism and oxidative stress. Through exploring mechanisms of lipid metabolism and the impact of dietary factors, including high-fat diets, his research aims to contribute to precision medicine strategies that address health disparities and metabolic disruptions. Blaner's findings underscore the significance of retinoid signaling pathways in managing conditions like type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related end-organ dysfunctions, positioning his work at the intersection of endocrinology, nutrition, and metabolic health.
