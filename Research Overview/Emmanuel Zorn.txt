Researcher: Emmanuel Zorn
Research Overview:
Emmanuel Zorn's research focuses on the intricate relationships among immune responses, particularly in the context of transplantation, including heart and kidney transplants. His extensive work delves into Crohn's disease, transplant immunology, and rejection mechanisms, examining the roles of various immune cells such as B cells, T cells, and plasma cells, along with the production of autoantibodies and donor-specific antibodies. Zorn employs advanced methodologies like ELISA, single-cell RNA sequencing, and next-generation sequencing to uncover genetic and immunological variations that affect transplant outcomes, including graft rejection and dysfunction. His studies also explore dietary antigens, particularly cowâ€™s milk, in human infants and their immunological responses, even in relation to chronic conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus and heart failure. The integration of machine learning and bioinformatics in his research further underlines his commitment to identifying biomarkers that can predict transplant success, mitigate complications like cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and enhance overall patient prognosis. Through his contributions, Zorn is advancing the understanding of immune mechanisms underlying transplantation and autoimmunity, paving the way for improved interventions and patient management strategies.
