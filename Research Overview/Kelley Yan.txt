Researcher: Kelley Yan
Research Overview:
Kelley Yan's research focuses on the dynamics of adult stem cells, particularly within intestinal and epithelial systems, exploring their potency, plasticity, and involvement in tissue regeneration. By utilizing advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and regulatory network analysis, her work identifies stemness signatures and lineage hierarchies, specifically highlighting the roles of intestinal stem cells, crypt base columnar cells, and transit-amplifying cells in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and facilitating regeneration. Additionally, her studies delve into interactions between the microbiome and the immune system in relation to cancer immunotherapy, inflammation, and the pathogenesis of conditions such as colorectal and esophageal cancer. Her research continues to uncover critical insights into the regenerative potential and therapeutic applications of stem cells, with implications for understanding human development and disease progression across various organ systems, including the intestine and lungs.
