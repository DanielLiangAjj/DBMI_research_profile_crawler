Researcher: Steven Kernie
Research Overview:
Steven Kernie's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily focused on critical care, particularly in pediatric populations, and the neurobiological impacts of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). His work investigates the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and neurogenesis in the context of brain injuries and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Kernie employs an array of methodologies including calcium imaging, optogenetics, and neuroimaging techniques like MRI and positron emission tomography to explore the roles of microglia, neural stem cells, and amyloid-beta oligomers in cognitive function and memory consolidation. Additionally, he addresses the implications of inflammation, blood-brain barrier integrity, and the use of pharmacological agents such as ketamine in treatment protocol development. His comprehensive approach also extends to the psychosocial dimensions of critical care, examining physician burnout, child abuse, and the effects of systemic inflammatory responses in pediatric intensive care scenarios. Overall, his research aims to enhance clinical guidelines and therapeutic strategies for improving outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injuries, while promoting overall physician well-being in high-stress environments.
