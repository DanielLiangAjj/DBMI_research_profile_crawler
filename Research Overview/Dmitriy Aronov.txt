Researcher: Dmitriy Aronov
Research Overview:
Dmitriy Aronov's research primarily focuses on the neuroscience of memory, particularly in relation to food caching behaviors observed in songbirds such as the black-capped chickadee and tufted titmouse. His studies explore the intricate roles of the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex, alongside neural mechanisms such as grid cells and cue cells, in the formation and retrieval of episodic memories. Utilizing advanced methodologies including virtual reality and recurrent neural network models, his work delves into the topography of neural inputs and the psychophysiological processes that underlie spatial navigation and prediction coding. This blend of animal behavior studies and computational neuroscience contributes significantly to our understanding of memory formation, spatial cognition, and the broader implications of neural plasticity across species.
