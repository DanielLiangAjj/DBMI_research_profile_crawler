Researcher: Jeanine Marie D'Armiento
Research Overview:
Jeanine Marie D'Armiento's research primarily focuses on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its associated mechanisms, particularly concerning lung inflammation, myogenesis, and the microbiome's role in respiratory diseases. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as metatranscriptomics and transcriptomics, her studies explore the pathophysiology of conditions like acute lung injury, emphysema, asthma, and the impact of environmental exposures, including cigarette smoke and military deployment. D'Armiento's work addresses critical elements like the Wnt signaling pathway, matrix metalloproteinases, and the role of immune responses in various lung diseases. Furthermore, her investigations into alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and other related factors contribute to understanding disease progression and therapeutic interventions in pulmonary conditions. By integrating insights from animal models and clinical studies, her research significantly advances the field of pulmonology, informing both basic science and clinical applications.
