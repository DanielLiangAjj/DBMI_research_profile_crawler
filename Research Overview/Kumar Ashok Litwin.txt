Researcher: Kumar Ashok Litwin
Research Overview:
Kumar Ashok Litwin's research focuses on the mechanisms of learning and memory, particularly through the lens of neural circuitry in model organisms such as *Drosophila melanogaster* and in rodent models. His studies delve into various forms of associative learning, operant conditioning, and reward learning, exploring how structures such as the cerebellum, mushroom bodies, and thalamic circuits contribute to these processes. By employing advanced techniques like two-photon imaging and computational biology approaches, he investigates the roles of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, in modulating learning behaviors and memory dynamics. His research highlights the interplay between neural variability, feedback mechanisms, and the representation of temporal information in decision-making and flexible behavior. Overall, Litwin's work enhances our understanding of neuronal circuits that underlie complex behaviors and memory systems, providing insights into fundamental aspects of neuroscience and their implications for understanding learning and decision-making processes in both basic and applied contexts.
