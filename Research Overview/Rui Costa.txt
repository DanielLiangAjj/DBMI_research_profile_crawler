Researcher: Rui Costa
Research Overview:
Rui Costa's research primarily focuses on the intricate mechanisms underlying motor control and learning, particularly in the context of neurological disorders such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease. His work examines the neurobiological foundations of movement through various experimental models, including mice and primates, utilizing advanced techniques like optogenetics, calcium imaging, and brain-machine interfaces. A significant aspect of his research involves exploring corticospinal pathways and the dynamics of motor commands, which contribute to behavioral strategies and motor system functionality. Additionally, Costa investigates the roles of dopaminergic neurons and the reward pathways in motor learning and behavior, shedding light on how factors such as laterality, movement vigor, and dyskinesia are affected. His interdisciplinary approach merges elements of neuroscience, behavioral science, and digital health, aiming to address challenges in neuroprosthetics, remote monitoring, and the optimization of motor control in daily activities. Through his work, he highlights the importance of understanding neural population dynamics and developing technology that aids individuals with movement disorders, ultimately contributing to advancements in treatment and rehabilitation strategies.
