Researcher: Debra J Wolgemuth
Research Overview:
Debra J. Wolgemuth's research explores the intricacies of male fertility, specifically focusing on the mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis and the potential for male contraception. A central theme of her work involves the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) and its role in the regulation of meiosis and spermiogenesis, emphasizing structure-activity relationships and selectivity of RARA antagonists. Her studies utilize both transactivation assays and mouse models to investigate the effects of various proteins, such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, on germ cell differentiation and the cell cycle. Furthermore, her work addresses the destruction of cellular structures during spermatogenesis, analyzing processes like apical ectoplasmic specialization disassembly and filamentous actin disorganization. Wolgemuth's investigations also touch upon the implications of retinoid signaling for male contraceptive strategies, suggesting potential pharmacological targets in the pursuit of effective male contraceptives. Overall, her research navigates the intersection of developmental biology and reproductive health, seeking to advance methodologies for fertility regulation in males.
