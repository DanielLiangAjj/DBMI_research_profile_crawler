Researcher: E. David Leonardo
Research Overview:
E. David Leonardo's research focuses on the intricate relationships between neurobiological mechanisms, particularly within the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and the manifestations of mood and anxiety disorders such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Key themes in his work include the role of corticosterone, serotonin (specifically through the 5-HT1A receptor), neurogenesis, and dendritic spine dynamics in stress response and resilience. He investigates the impact of early postnatal neurogenesis and adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus on behavioral outcomes in models of chronic social defeat and anxiety-like behavior. His studies employ advanced techniques to understand gene expression regulation related to psychological stress, behavior, and mental health across various animal models, including specific inbred strains of mice. Overall, his research contributes to a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of anxiety and mood disorders and aims to identify potential therapeutic targets for treatment.
