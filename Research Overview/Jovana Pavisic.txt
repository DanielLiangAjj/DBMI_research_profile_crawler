Researcher: Jovana Pavisic
Research Overview:
Jovana Pavisic's research primarily focuses on advancing the treatment and management of diffuse midline gliomas, particularly through innovative methods such as focused ultrasound for enhancing blood-brain barrier permeability. Her work extensively explores the intersection of clinical research informatics and patient recruitment strategies for clinical trials, emphasizing the use of electronic health records for outcome assessment. Additionally, Pavisic's studies employ various animal models, including rodents, to investigate the tumor microenvironment and the roles of different immune cells, such as microglia and macrophages, in glioma progression. Her research is not limited to neurology; it also encompasses broader oncological themes, such as genomic imprinting and treatment responses in other neoplasms, while considering the psychosocial factors affecting patients and families during treatment. Overall, her contributions are centered around optimizing therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcomes in oncology through rigorous clinical research methodologies.
