Researcher: Matthew Mcdermott
Research Overview:
Matthew McDermott's research encompasses a diverse array of topics in computational biology, machine learning, and clinical decision support, particularly as they relate to oncology and neuroprosthetics. His work investigates the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in understanding tumor evolution and classifying various forms of cancer, such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and acinar cell carcinoma. Additionally, his research delves into the implications of biomarkers, like ferritin, and the challenges posed by issues such as missing data and algorithmic bias in clinical contexts. Beyond cancer research, McDermott explores advanced technologies in bioelectronic medicine, focusing on neural implants and peripheral nerve regeneration, shedding light on the foreign body response and the design of neural interfaces. Through this interdisciplinary approach, he aims to enhance clinical decision-making and patient outcomes while addressing critical elements of reproducibility and precision medicine in health care delivery.
