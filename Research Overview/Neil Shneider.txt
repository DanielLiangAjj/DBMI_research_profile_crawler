Researcher: Neil Shneider
Research Overview:
Neil Shneider's research primarily focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Through the utilization of advanced techniques such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), CRISPR, high-content imaging, and machine learning, he investigates the roles of RNA-binding proteins like TDP-43 and FUS, as well as genetic factors including C9ORF72 mutations. His work explores cellular and animal models, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and genetically modified mice, to elucidate disease phenotypes, protein aggregation, and neurodegenerative pathways. Additionally, Shneider's research encompasses the interplay of cognitive behaviors, cell proliferation, and lipid homeostasis in the context of motor neuron diseases. By integrating transcriptomics and neuroanatomical studies, his investigations aim at advancing therapeutic strategies and clinical trial designs for ALS and related disorders, thereby contributing valuable insights to the field of neurobiology and regenerative medicine.
