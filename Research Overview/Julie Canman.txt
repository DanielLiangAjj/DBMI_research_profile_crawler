Researcher: Julie Canman
Research Overview:
Julie Canman's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on cell biology, particularly related to cell division, chromosome segregation, and the dynamics of microtubules. Her work prominently utilizes model organisms such as *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila melanogaster*, and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* to explore intricate processes like mitosis, meiosis, cytokinesis, and spindle assembly. Additionally, she investigates the intersections between autophagy, neurodegeneration, and cellular response to environmental factors, including circadian rhythms and dietary influences. The use of cutting-edge techniques like CRISPR/Cas9 for genetic manipulation alongside advanced imaging methods, such as confocal and infrared microscopy, highlights her commitment to elucidating cellular mechanisms at a molecular level. Overall, Canman's research contributes significantly to our understanding of fundamental biological processes and their implications in health and disease, bridging insights across genetics, developmental biology, and neuroscience.
