Researcher: Chin Hur
Research Overview:
Chin Hur's research primarily focuses on cancer epidemiology, treatment outcomes, and health economics, particularly concerning gastrointestinal and gynecologic cancers. His work encompasses a wide range of topics, including the prevalence and risk factors of cancers such as endometrial, gastric, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, as well as the impact of surgical interventions like hysterectomy and gastrectomy. He utilizes advanced methodologies, including Bayesian statistics, Markov models, and machine learning, to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses that inform cost-effectiveness analyses of cancer screening and treatment protocols. Furthermore, his research investigates the complications associated with surgical procedures, the implications of obesity and dietary factors on health outcomes, and the disparities in cancer care across racial and socioeconomic groups. Chronic conditions, digital health records, and immune-related adverse events in cancer treatments are also key areas of his investigations, highlighting his commitment to improving both survivorship and quality of life for patients. Overall, Hurâ€™s extensive body of work aims to advance the understanding and management of cancer while addressing critical public health challenges and healthcare disparities.
