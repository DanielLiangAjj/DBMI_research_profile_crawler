Researcher: Laura Landweber
Research Overview:
Laura Landweber’s research primarily focuses on the genomics and evolutionary biology of ciliates, particularly Oxytricha, exploring genome rearrangement phenomena in protozoan species. Her work includes extensive studies on the macronucleus and micronucleus of ciliates, highlighting the intricate mechanisms that dictate genomic integrity, such as DNA elimination, transposable elements, and methylation processes. Landweber utilizes advanced techniques like proteomics, next-generation sequencing, and whole-genome epigenetic profiling to unravel the complexities of nuclear proteomes and the evolutionary implications of gene rearrangements, including scrambling, alternative splicing, and the role of long noncoding RNAs. This research not only enhances our understanding of genetic variation and epigenetics in ciliates but also offers insights into evolutionary mechanisms like purifying selection and transposon domestication, contributing significantly to the field of comparative genomics. Overall, Landweber’s work elucidates the dynamic nature of ciliate genomes, prompting further inquiry into fundamental biological processes and evolutionary trajectories across diverse eukaryotic systems.
