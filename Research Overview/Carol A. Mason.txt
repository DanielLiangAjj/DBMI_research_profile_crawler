Researcher: Carol A. Mason
Research Overview:
Carol A. Mason's research significantly advances the fields of neuroregeneration and regenerative medicine, particularly focusing on the mechanisms and potential therapies for optic neuropathy and glaucoma. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, her work emphasizes the role of retinal ganglion cells, axon guidance, and neuroprotection in restoring vision. By exploring innovative therapies such as stem cell transplantation and the use of organoids, she investigates ways to enhance neurogenesis and promote axonal regeneration within the visual system. Additionally, her research delves into the molecular basis of neuronal plasticity, including the intricacies of intercellular signaling and cellular differentiation linked to optic nerve diseases. Through the integration of advanced techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing and in vivo models, Mason's findings contribute to a deeper understanding of visual pathway development and hold promise for future applications in vision restoration and treatment of neurodegenerative conditions affecting the retina.
