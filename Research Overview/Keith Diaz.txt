Researcher: Keith Diaz
Research Overview:
Keith Diaz's research primarily focuses on the interconnectedness of cardiovascular health, physical activity, psychosocial factors, and the impact of emerging technologies on health monitoring. His work extensively explores conditions such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, emphasizing the role of lifestyle factors like exercise and sedentary behavior in shaping health outcomes, particularly among diverse populations including adolescents, children, and Hispanic Americans. Diaz employs advanced methodologies such as ecological momentary assessment, machine learning, and various monitoring technologies like accelerometers and smartphones to gather real-time data on physical activity and health behaviors. His studies underline the significance of vascular health, endothelial function, and cognitive factors in the context of acute coronary syndrome and cardiovascular disease prevention. Furthermore, his contributions to clinical decision support tools and predictive modeling seek to enhance personalized healthcare strategies, particularly regarding physical health interventions and the management of chronic conditions. Overall, his research aims to bridge the gap between behavioral health and physiological outcomes, informing future public health initiatives and clinical practices aimed at improving cardiovascular health across demographics.
