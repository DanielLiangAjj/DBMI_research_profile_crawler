Researcher: Randy Auerbach
Research Overview:
Randy Auerbach's research focuses on various aspects of adolescent mental health, particularly as it pertains to conditions such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. His work delves into the complex interplay of psychological processes, emotional regulation, and social factors that contribute to suicidal ideation and self-injurious behaviors among youth. Auerbach employs methodologies like longitudinal studies, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and neuroimaging to analyze cognitive biases, mood disorders, and the effectiveness of interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and e-health strategies. His exploration of risk factors—including familial influences, psychological trauma, and substance use—highlights the multifaceted nature of these mental health challenges. By integrating findings from advanced analytical methods like machine learning and latent class analysis, Auerbach aims to identify predictive markers of mental health outcomes. Ultimately, his research seeks to inform prevention strategies and therapeutic approaches tailored for adolescents, contributing significantly to the understanding and treatment of mental health issues within this vulnerable population.
