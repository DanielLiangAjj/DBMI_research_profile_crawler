Researcher: Anna Basile
Research Overview:
Anna Basile's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on cancer biology, neurodegeneration, and stroke, utilizing cutting-edge genomic and imaging techniques. Central to her work is the exploration of KRAS isoforms and mutations, particularly the p.G12C mutation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, utilizing monoclonal antibodies and small molecules targeting tumor microenvironments and related pathways. Additionally, she investigates the role of BAG3 and cellular signaling in fibrotic processes associated with cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and ALS. Her studies integrate machine learning and deep learning approaches for predictive modeling in patient outcomes, alongside extensive population genetics efforts showcased in studies linked to the 1000 Genomes Project. Furthermore, Basile's work examines the impacts of stroke treatments, including thrombectomy and thrombolysis, on cognitive function and neurological recovery. By bridging molecular biology, clinical applications, and advanced computational methods, her research contributes significantly to understanding disease mechanisms and improving therapeutic strategies.
