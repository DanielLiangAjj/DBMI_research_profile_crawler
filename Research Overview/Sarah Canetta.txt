Researcher: Sarah Canetta
Research Overview:
Sarah Canettaâ€™s research focuses on the intricate relationship between adolescent neural development and mental health disorders, particularly schizophrenia. Her work investigates the maturation processes of the prefrontal cortex, with a specific emphasis on the excitation-inhibition balance and the role of thalamocortical projections. Utilizing models such as mice, she examines cognitive flexibility, motivation, and behavioral responses under varying conditions including food restriction and anxiety. Canetta employs techniques like optogenetics to delve into the workings of parvalbumin interneurons and their influence on gamma and theta oscillations within neuronal circuits. Through her studies, she seeks to understand the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders, highlighting the significance of brain oscillations and synaptic transmission in the context of adolescent development. Overall, her research contributes valuable insights into the pathophysiology of mental disorders, aiming to inform strategies for prevention and intervention.
