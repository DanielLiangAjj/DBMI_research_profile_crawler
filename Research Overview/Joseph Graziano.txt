Researcher: Joseph Graziano
Research Overview:
Joseph Graziano's research primarily investigates the health effects of arsenic exposure and its implications on public health, particularly in children and adolescent populations in Bangladesh. His work emphasizes the significance of arsenic methylation, nutrient interactions, and environmental exposures, utilizing biomarkers to assess the impact on cognitive function, cardiovascular diseases, and various health outcomes. Graziano explores gene-environment interactions, particularly how factors like folic acid, creatine, and vitamin B12 may influence arsenic metabolism and related health risks. His studies encompass various methodologies, including longitudinal and cross-sectional designs, and they highlight the prevalence of arsenic in drinking water, its toxicological effects, and the need for public health interventions to mitigate exposure. By combining epidemiological data with molecular studies, Graziano aims to elucidate the mechanisms of arsenic-related health effects, ultimately contributing to improved health practices and policies in affected regions.
