Researcher: Sally Amundson
Research Overview:
Dr. Sally Amundson's research focuses on the biological effects of radiation exposure, particularly in relation to leukemia and hematological conditions. Her work employs various methodologies, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to study the molecular pathways involved in radiation-induced damage and the inflammatory responses that follow. Utilizing advanced techniques like single-cell analysis and mass spectrometry, she investigates biomarkers for radiation dosimetry and the dynamic responses of blood cells to varying irradiation doses, from low to very high levels. Additionally, Amundson explores the implications of radiation exposure in space health and develops tissue-engineered models to better understand organ responses. This interdisciplinary approach contributes significantly to the fields of radiobiology, bioinformatics, and space medicine, ultimately enhancing our understanding of ionizing radiation's impact on human health and aiding in the advancement of medical countermeasures and biodosimetry methodologies.
