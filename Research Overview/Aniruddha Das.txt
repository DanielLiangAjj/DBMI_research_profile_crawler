Researcher: Aniruddha Das
Research Overview:
Aniruddha Das's research primarily revolves around the interplay between genetic, psychological, and social factors influencing cognitive function and well-being across various demographics, particularly in older adults. His work explores concepts such as allostatic load, social allostasis, and the impact of loneliness and social ties on mental health, engaging with methods like high-throughput sequencing and two-photon microscopy to investigate circular RNAs and their roles in neural function and gene regulation. He employs a variety of analytical approaches, including fixed-effects cross-lagged panel models and multivariate analysis, to unravel the complex relationships between educational attainment, depressive symptoms, and cognitive performance. Furthermore, his research examines the effects of childhood experiences, familial relationships, and trauma on health outcomes, leveraging findings from studies such as SHARE and HRS to highlight the nuances of aging and social integration. Das's integrative focus not only enhances the understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms but also underscores the significance of psychosocial factors in promoting quality of life in geriatric populations.
