Researcher: Jahar Bhattacharya
Research Overview:
Jahar Bhattacharya's research encompasses a wide range of significant topics focused primarily on acute lung injury (ALI) and its underlying mechanisms, emphasizing the interactions between the pulmonary system and various pathological conditions such as influenza A virus infections and COVID-19. His work investigates the role of the blood-air barrier and the subsequent effects of inflammation, endocytosis, and calcium signaling in the context of lung capillary dynamics and pulmonary edema. Furthermore, Bhattacharya delves into cellular immune responses involving macrophages, regulatory T cells, and possible treatment avenues with drugs such as ACE inhibitors and statins. His studies also incorporate the exploration of mitochondrial functions, epithelial transport of ions and water, and mitochondrial transfer mechanisms in lung repair and regeneration. Overall, his research provides valuable insights into the cellular and molecular responses involved in lung health and disease, contributing to the understanding and potential management of acute respiratory distress syndromes.
