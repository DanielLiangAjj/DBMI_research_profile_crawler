Researcher: Emmanuelle Passegue
Research Overview:
Emmanuelle Passegue's research focuses on the intricate relationships between hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and various biological processes influenced by aging, metabolism, inflammation, and the immune system. Her work examines the mechanisms of autophagy, quiescence, and rejuvenation in HSCs, particularly in the context of aging and regenerative medicine. By exploring how maternal-fetal interactions and cytokines like interleukin-10 affect hematopoiesis during development, her research contributes to a deeper understanding of cellular differentiation, myelopoiesis, and immune-stem cell interactions. Additionally, Passegue investigates the role of HSC signaling in the tumor microenvironment and its implications for cancer, particularly myeloid-derived malignancies, through the lens of epigenetic modifications and metabolic signaling pathways. Overall, her studies advance our knowledge of HSC niche regulation and the potential for therapeutic applications in hematological diseases and regenerative therapies.
