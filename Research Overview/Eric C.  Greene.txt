Researcher: Eric C.  Greene
Research Overview:
Eric C. Greene's research primarily investigates the mechanisms and dynamics of DNA repair processes, focusing on homologous recombination (HR) and associated proteins such as Rad51 and its paralogs (Rad54, Rad55-Rad57). His studies utilize innovative single-molecule techniques, including DNA curtains, optical tweezers, and magnetic tweezers, to analyze the activities of helicases, particularly Pif1 and RecQ helicases, in translocating nucleic acids. His work emphasizes the role of single-stranded DNA binding and translocation in facilitating the homologous recombination process, crucial for maintaining genome integrity and responding to DNA damage. Additionally, Greene integrates advanced imaging methods like cryoelectron microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to elucidate the structural and functional relationships between DNA repair complexes and their substrates in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. Overall, his comprehensive approach contributes significantly to our understanding of DNA repair mechanisms and the inherent molecular dynamics of genomic stability.
