Researcher: Jeremy Worley
Research Overview:
Jeremy Worley's research focuses on several critical areas in cancer biology and therapeutics, with a particular emphasis on metastatic prostate cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. His work explores the integration of advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and systems biology to better understand the tumor microenvironment and its role in disease progression. He investigates the mechanisms behind immune responses to therapies like anti-PD-1, as well as the influence of mechanical properties, such as stiffness, on tumor dynamics. Additionally, Worley studies hematopoietic stem cell biology, cellular reprogramming, and gene regulatory networks, which have implications for a range of conditions including atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Through his research, he aims to elucidate the interactions between tumors and immune cells, as well as to identify master regulators and therapeutic targets that can improve treatment outcomes in various malignancies.
