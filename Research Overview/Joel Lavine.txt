Researcher: Joel Lavine
Research Overview:
Joel Lavine's research primarily revolves around the investigation and understanding of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), particularly in pediatric populations. His work encompasses a multidisciplinary approach, integrating biological networks, metabolomics, proteomics, and advanced imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to unravel the complexities of liver diseases. By utilizing non-invasive biomarkers, Lavine explores how factors such as obesity, inflammation, liver histology, and various metabolic syndromes contribute to the disease progression and the severity of liver conditions, including fibrosis and cirrhosis. His studies also delve into the impact of hormones and genetics on NAFLD, with a focus on sex differences and pediatric obesity. In summary, Lavine's research is pivotal in advancing our understanding of NAFLD and NASH, aiming to improve diagnostic methods and therapeutic strategies for affected individuals, especially children and adolescents.
