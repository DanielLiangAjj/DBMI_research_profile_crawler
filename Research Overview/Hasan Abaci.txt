Researcher: Hasan Abaci
Research Overview:
Hasan Abaci's research primarily focuses on the development and engineering of bioengineered skin and related microphysiological systems. His work utilizes advanced techniques such as 3D bioprinting and organ-on-a-chip models to create functional skin tissues incorporating hair follicles, vascular structures, and extracellular matrices. A significant emphasis is placed on harnessing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and bioengineering methodologies to address skin-related diseases and conditions, including atopic dermatitis and epidermolysis bullosa. Additionally, Abaci's studies investigate the interactions between engineered tissues and immune cells, underscoring the importance of understanding tissue integration and response in therapeutic applications. His contributions also extend to drug evaluation and the development of antiviral therapeutics, incorporating microfluidics and biomaterials to enhance drug delivery and testing systems. Overall, Abaci's research represents a critical intersection of tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and bioengineering, aiming to develop sophisticated models for skin health and disease understanding.
