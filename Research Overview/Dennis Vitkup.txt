Researcher: Dennis Vitkup
Research Overview:
Dennis Vitkup's research encompasses a multidisciplinary exploration of molecular evolution, protein dynamics, and the underlying systems biology that governs cellular processes. His work is characterized by a focus on the "molecular clock" of proteins, investigating aspects such as protein evolution, misfolding, and stability, particularly in relation to essential receptors like EGFR and their role in signaling networks. By leveraging computational biology, Vitkup employs theoretical models and simulations to analyze protein function, population heterogeneity, and metabolic networks across various organisms, including humans and E. coli. His research also delves into the implications of protein evolution in pathological conditions, such as cancer and autism spectrum disorders, linking molecular mechanisms to broader evolutionary principles. Through this integrative approach, Vitkup aims to enhance our understanding of biological systems, exploring how evolutionary pressures shape protein functionalities and, ultimately, organismal phenotypes.
