Researcher: Ai Yamamoto
Research Overview:
Ai Yamamoto's research primarily explores the intricate relationships between neurodegeneration, autophagy, and cognition, specifically in the context of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Her work delves into the mechanisms of selective autophagy and its role in maintaining synapse homeostasis and neuronal function, focusing on proteins such as Huntingtin and the pathways involving ALFY and WDFY3. Additionally, her research addresses the implications of autophagic processes in various cancers and pathological states, including bacterial infections and exacerbations related to COVID-19. Insights into biomarkers, such as Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and the evaluation of protein aggregation are central to her studies, utilizing various animal models and cell-based systems. Ultimately, Yamamoto aims to enhance the understanding of autophagy's role in neurodegenerative diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target, showcasing a multi-faceted approach that intersects neurology, cancer biology, and infection responses.
