Researcher: Harris Wang
Research Overview:
Harris Wang's research encompasses a multifaceted exploration of microbiota, immune responses, and genetic engineering, with a specific focus on gastrointestinal health, infectious diseases—including COVID-19—and advanced synthetic biology techniques. His studies on Barrett esophagus and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma highlight the significant interactions between bile acids, the farnesoid X receptor, and gut microbiota, emphasizing the importance of intestinal health in managing gastrointestinal diseases. Additionally, Wang's work on SARS-CoV-2 showcases insights into viral infectivity, immune evasion, and antibody response dynamics, with implications for vaccine development. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as metagenomics and CRISPR-based systems, he investigates microbial community interactions and their roles in human health, enabling innovative strategies for addressing antimicrobial resistance and improving health outcomes through microbiome modulation. His contributions significantly enhance the understanding of complex biological systems and their regulation, positioning him as a key figure in the intersection of microbiology, immunology, and synthetic biology.
