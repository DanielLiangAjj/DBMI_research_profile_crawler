Researcher: Andrew Beenken
Research Overview:
Andrew Beenken's research encompasses a wide array of topics in nephrology, microbiology, and molecular biology, focusing on the mechanisms underlying kidney diseases and their associated biomarkers. His work prominently addresses the effects of amphotericin B, a well-known antifungal agent, on cholesterol-related ion channels and nephrotoxicity, emphasizing the importance of pathways such as endocytosis and the roles of receptors including CD91, LRP1, and megalin. Additionally, Beenken investigates cardiac health, examining the implications of growth factors and cardiovascular agents like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in conditions such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. His methodologies include advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, which contribute to understanding protein interactions, gene expression regulation, and the structural biology of key receptors linked to various pathophysiological states. Collectively, this research highlights the complex interplay between kidney function, cardiovascular health, and molecular signaling pathways, aiming to advance diagnostics and therapeutics for associated diseases.
