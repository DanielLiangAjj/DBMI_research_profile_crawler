Researcher: Marian B. Carlson
Research Overview:
Marian B. Carlson's research predominantly focuses on the mechanisms of energy metabolism and signal transduction mediated by AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPK) within the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). Her work explores key processes such as glucose metabolism, protein phosphorylation, enzymatic activation, and the roles of various protein phosphatases and kinases. Through genetic manipulation, including gene deletion and site-directed mutagenesis, Carlson investigates the functional implications of mutations on enzyme activity and cellular responses to oxidative stress and nutrient availability. Her contributions provide significant insights into the molecular underpinnings of energy regulation and transcriptional control, highlighting the intricate network of protein interactions and modifications that govern metabolic adaptation in fungal systems.
