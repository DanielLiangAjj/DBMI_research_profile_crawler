Researcher: David Owens
Research Overview:
David Owens's research is characterized by a comprehensive exploration of health-related themes, particularly in diabetes management, medical education, and public health. His investigations into type 2 diabetes emphasize the complexity of glycemic control, the role of insulin therapies—including basal and rapid-acting insulin analogues—and the challenges of hypoglycemia. Owens has also demonstrated interest in diabetes complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, while utilizing innovative approaches like machine learning for predictive modeling in clinical outcomes. His work in medical and postgraduate education highlights effective teaching strategies and the integration of technology in learning, particularly in otolaryngology and health care. Beyond diabetes and education, he has conducted studies on environmental health, particularly groundwater quality and its microbiological safety. Through these diverse research interests, Owens aims to enhance understanding and improve healthcare practices across multiple disciplines, ultimately contributing to better health outcomes and patient education.
