Researcher: Rebecca Hough
Research Overview:
Rebecca Hough’s research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily related to acute lung injury and its relationship with various systemic and cellular mechanisms. Her studies focus on key areas such as endothelium and lung capillaries, exploring how mitochondrial function and uncoupling proteins interact within the context of acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS). Additionally, her work examines the pathophysiology of nonpulmonary organ injury, including the implications of cancer biology, particularly in ovarian cancer metastasis, and the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancer stem cells. She utilizes advanced methodologies to investigate the impact of microRNAs and tumor angiogenesis in these processes. By bridging pulmonary and vascular biology with oncological research, Hough’s contributions shed light on the complex interplay between lung function, systemic inflammation, and cancer dynamics, offering insights that could inform therapeutic strategies for both lung and cancer-related pathologies.
