Researcher: Helen Blair Simpson
Research Overview:
Helen Blair Simpson's research primarily focuses on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and related anxiety disorders, with an emphasis on understanding treatment effectiveness, neurobiological underpinnings, and innovative therapeutic approaches. Her work utilizes machine learning techniques, neuroimaging (such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging), and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to explore predictors of treatment outcomes and the complexities of OCD's comorbidities. Simpson's studies span various populations, including children and adolescents, aiming to address health disparities linked to socioeconomic factors and access to mental health care. She investigates the roles of pharmacotherapy, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as well as mindfulness and real-time neurofeedback interventions, highlighting the significance of tailored treatment approaches. Her research contributes to the fields of psychiatric disorder classification, treatment guidelines, and the utilization of digital health technologies, advocating for improvements in patient care and outcomes in OCD management.
