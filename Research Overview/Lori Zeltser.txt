Researcher: Lori Zeltser
Research Overview:
Lori Zeltser's research focuses on the intricate relationships among energy metabolism, neural circuits, and feeding behaviors, particularly in the context of obesity and related disorders. Using various experimental models, including mice, her work explores how factors such as developmental programming, environmental stressors, and nutrition impact thermogenesis, energy expenditure, and the regulation of feeding behavior. Key themes in her studies encompass cold-induced and diet-induced thermogenesis, the role of leptin and other neuropeptides like AgRP and POMC, and how early-life experiences shape metabolic outcomes. Zeltser investigates the neurobiological underpinnings of emotional and disordered eating, emphasizing the influence of social isolation and stress on appetite regulation. Her extensive analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of childhood obesity and anorexia nervosa, contributing to a better understanding of the biological basis of these conditions. Overall, her research significantly advances the field of neuroscience and metabolic regulation, highlighting the complex interactions between environment, behavior, and physiology in the development of eating disorders and obesity.
