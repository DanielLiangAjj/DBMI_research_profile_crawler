Researcher: R K Liem
Research Overview:
R K Liem's research focuses on the intricate roles of intermediate filaments, particularly neurofilament proteins, in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). Through the investigation of cytoskeletal components, including microtubules and actin filaments, Liem explores their interactions with proteins such as spectraplakin and dystonin, which are crucial for axonal transport and the structural integrity of motor neurons. Utilizing models such as transgenic mice and induced pluripotent stem cells, the research aims to elucidate the mechanisms of inherited neuropathies and their electrophysiological implications. By bridging molecular biology and neurophysiology, Liem's work contributes to a deeper understanding of the cellular pathologies underlying neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the significance of intermediate filament dynamics in neuronal health and disease progression.
