Researcher: Stephen Rayport
Research Overview:
Stephen Rayport's research predominantly focuses on the intricate interplay between neurotransmitter systems, particularly in relation to dopamine, glutamate, and their roles in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. Utilizing model organisms like Drosophila and various mouse models, his studies leverage advanced techniques including RNA sequencing, fluorescence imaging, optogenetics, and Western blotting to explore mechanisms of neurotransmission, synaptic connectivity, and the pathology of neurodegeneration. Rayport's work emphasizes the significance of glutamate and the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 in excitatory neurotransmission and its co-transmission with dopamine in neural circuits involved in addiction, impulsivity, and resilience to stressors like starvation. The research not only enhances the understanding of neuronal connectivity and signaling in the striatum and other brain regions but also aims to uncover potential therapeutic targets for treating neuropsychiatric disorders. Through this multidimensional approach, Rayport contributes valuable insights into the biochemical and physiological underpinnings of neurotransmitter systems, providing a comprehensive view of their roles in both health and disease.
