Researcher: Wellington Cardoso
Research Overview:
Wellington Cardoso's research encompasses a diverse range of topics centered around lung development, regeneration, and the intricate roles of stem cells and signaling pathways in these processes. His work explores critical factors such as Nkx2-1 and Sox genes in lung evolution and development, emphasizing epithelial differentiation and airway repair mechanisms. Cardoso delves into the application of regenerative medicine through innovative techniques like blastocyst complementation and organotypic cultures. His studies also address health implications related to lung diseases, including respiratory conditions exacerbated by environmental factors like air pollution, and their connections to viral infections such as COVID-19 and influenza. Moreover, he investigates cellular behaviors in different biological contexts, leveraging animal models, particularly mice, and stem cell approaches including human pluripotent stem cells, to unravel the complexities of lung biology and potential therapeutic avenues. Overall, his extensive research contributes significantly to our understanding of lung pathology, developmental biology, and the potential of regenerative strategies to enhance lung repair and function.
