Researcher: Vincenzo Alessandro Gennarino
Research Overview:
Vincenzo Alessandro Gennarino's research focuses on the intricate roles of BMI1 and microRNAs in cellular differentiation, particularly in the context of colon cancer. His work examines the tumor-suppressor functions of these molecular components and their regulation of gene expression, with a specific emphasis on the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1. Gennarino employs a variety of experimental and computational techniques to analyze gene regulatory networks, epigenetic modifications, and the binding interactions of microRNAs and proteins in both human and murine models. By investigating the mechanisms involved in colonic neoplasms and the influence of developmental gene expression regulation, his research contributes valuable insights into understanding how genetic and environmental factors intertwine in cancer biology. Overall, Gennarino's findings aim to delineate the molecular underpinnings of tumorigenesis, offering potential paths for therapeutic intervention in colorectal cancer.
