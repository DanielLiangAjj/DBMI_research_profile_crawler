Researcher: Shalmali Joshi
Research Overview:
Shalmali Joshi's research encompasses a multifaceted exploration of brain stimulation techniques, particularly focusing on methodologies such as transcranial direct current stimulation (MtDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), to investigate effects on cortical hyperexcitability and muscle function plasticity. By integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning into healthcare delivery, Joshi aims to address critical health disparities and improve patient safety and quality of care. Her work emphasizes the ethical implications of these technologies, advocating for bias mitigation and social justice in health models. Through statistical modeling of healthcare data, including electronic health records, Joshi contributes significantly to the understanding of how social determinants of health influence disease susceptibility and treatment outcomes. Overall, her research strives to create equitable healthcare practices that leverage advanced technologies while addressing the ethical considerations that come with their implementation.
