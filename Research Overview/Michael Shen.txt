Researcher: Michael Shen
Research Overview:
Michael Shen’s research traverses diverse and significant domains in cancer biology, particularly focusing on prostate cancer. His work investigates key mechanisms of differentiation, epigenetic regulation, and the plasticity of progenitor cells in both normal and afflicted tissues. Shen employs innovative techniques such as single-cell analysis and transcriptomics to understand the tumor microenvironment and the heterogeneity of cancer cell populations. His research addresses crucial aspects of castration-resistant prostate cancer, exploring the roles of androgen signaling, drug resistance, and therapeutic targets like PARP inhibitors. Additionally, Shen’s interdisciplinary efforts encompass digital health applications, emphasizing healthcare utilization, telemedicine, and patient-provider communication to optimize oncology practices. By integrating systems biology with advanced methodologies, such as finite element analysis and organoid technology, his work aims to uncover underlying biological networks and improve patient outcomes in prostate cancer and other malignancies. Overall, Shen's research contributes substantially to the understanding of tumor biology and develops strategies for precision medicine in oncology.
