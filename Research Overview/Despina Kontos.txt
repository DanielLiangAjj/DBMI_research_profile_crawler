Researcher: Despina Kontos
Research Overview:
Despina Kontos's research focuses on breast cancer risk assessment and the utilization of advanced imaging techniques, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in oncology. Her studies explore the implications of breast density, tumor heterogeneity, and genetic predisposition, particularly concerning gender-affirming treatments like hormone replacement therapy in transgender populations. Kontos investigates various facets of breast cancer, including the epidemiology of different tumor subtypes, with a particular interest in triple-negative breast cancer, and identifies risk factors through comprehensive methodologies such as radiomics and MRI. By integrating precision medicine and predictive modeling, her work aims to address health disparities and improve screening strategies for high-risk groups, including non-binary individuals and those of African ancestry. Overall, Kontos's research contributes significantly to the understanding and prediction of breast cancer risks, fostering better clinical decision-making and more personalized patient care.
