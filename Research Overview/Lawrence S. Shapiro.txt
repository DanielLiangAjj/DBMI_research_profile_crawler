Researcher: Lawrence S. Shapiro
Research Overview:
Lawrence S. Shapiro's research primarily focuses on the interplay between epigenetics and gene regulation, employing advanced techniques such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq). His work explores the roles of various transcription factors, particularly Basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factors, and their binding sites in genetic expression, with a strong emphasis on the function of histone demethylases and the implications of methylation in gene regulation. Shapiro's studies on cultured cells, including HEK293 and HeLa, delve into the structural and functional characteristics of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction pathways, particularly in the context of tumor suppressor proteins and genetic mutations. His investigations extend to understanding genetic predispositions to diseases, as demonstrated through case-control studies and detailed molecular sequence analyses. Overall, Shapiro's contributions significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic regulation and its implications in health and disease.
