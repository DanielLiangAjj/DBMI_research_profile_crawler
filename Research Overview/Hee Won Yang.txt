Researcher: Hee Won Yang
Research Overview:
Hee Won Yang's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily centered around cell biology, cancer research, and viral infections, particularly focusing on the mechanisms of cell cycle regulation and tumor progression. Key areas of investigation include the dynamics of cell-cycle sensors and the role of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4/6) in breast cancer and melanoma, with an emphasis on understanding drug resistance mechanisms and signaling pathways involving E2F transcription factors and retinoblastoma protein. Yang's work also addresses cellular heterogeneity, particularly in relation to tumor microenvironments and immune response dynamics, including T cell interactions and angiogenesis. In the context of infectious diseases, recent studies investigate SARS-CoV-2, exploring the efficacy of antiviral drugs and protease inhibitors, as well as employing cell-based assays to assess viral cytotoxicity. Overall, Yang's research significantly contributes to the understanding of cell cycle regulation and disease mechanisms, with implications for targeted therapies in cancer and infectious diseases.
