Researcher: Rodney Rothstein
Research Overview:
Rodney Rothstein's research primarily focuses on the intricate mechanisms of DNA repair and recombination, with a significant emphasis on homologous recombination and its associated pathways in yeast, particularly *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. His work explores the dynamics of chromatin, R-loops, and DNA:RNA hybrids, which are critical for understanding transcription-related genomic stability and the processing of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Rothstein has extensively studied the roles of various proteins involved in DNA repair, such as Rad51, Rad52, and Dmc1, and their functions within repair foci and during homologous pairing. His research also investigates the consequences of genomic instability, including gross chromosomal rearrangements, mutations, and their links to cancer, such as colon neoplasms. By utilizing a range of techniques—ranging from fluorescence microscopy to CRISPR-mediated genetics—Rothstein aims to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of genetic recombination and repair processes, ultimately shedding light on their implications for human health and disease.
