Researcher: Scott Small
Research Overview:
Scott Small's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focused on neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and their associated biological mechanisms and therapeutic approaches. Central to his work is the investigation of the retromer complex and its role in endosomal trafficking, protein transport, and lysosomal function, which are pivotal in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative disorders. He employs advanced methodologies, including deep learning, accelerometry, and neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, to enhance our understanding of cognitive aging and to develop innovative biomarker-driven interventions. Additionally, his research extends to the biomechanics of joint arthroplasties, specifically addressing knee and hip replacements, utilizing rigorous experimental designs and computational modeling. Importantly, his work also incorporates elements of molecular epidemiology in addressing malaria vector systems in different geographic contexts, revealing insights into genetic variations and adaptations relevant to public health. Overall, Scott Small's comprehensive research agenda not only aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying complex diseases but also strives to translate these findings into effective clinical practices and preventative strategies.
