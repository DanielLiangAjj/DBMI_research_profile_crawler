Researcher: Rodney Joel Rothstein
Research Overview:
Rodney Joel Rothstein's research primarily focuses on the mechanisms of DNA repair, emphasizing the processes of homologous recombination and the dynamics involved in maintaining genetic stability. His work delves into the roles of key proteins such as Rad51, Rad52, and various helicases in the repair of double-strand breaks and the formation and resolution of R-loops during transcription. Using advanced techniques like fluorescence microscopy and single-particle tracking, Rothstein investigates how genetic recombination contributes to chromosome rearrangements and genome integrity in model organisms, notably yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Furthermore, his research explores the implications of these mechanisms in cancer development and the context of endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby bridging fundamental genetic processes with clinical relevance in human diseases, including brain and colon neoplasms. Overall, Rothstein's contributions highlight the intricate balance of DNA repair processes crucial for cellular function and the prevention of genomic instability.
