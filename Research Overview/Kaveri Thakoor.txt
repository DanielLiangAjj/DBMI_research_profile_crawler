Researcher: Kaveri Thakoor
Research Overview:
Kaveri Thakoor's research focuses on the integration of deep learning techniques with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to enhance the diagnosis and management of glaucoma. By employing advanced neural networks, particularly recurrent neural networks, the research explores saliency prediction and eye-tracking methodologies to analyze patient fixations and pupil responses during video viewing. This work aims to identify structural biomarkers within key retinal layers, such as the retinal ganglion cell layer and the retinal nerve fiber layer, to improve the predictive value of glaucoma diagnostics. Additionally, the use of unsupervised clustering techniques allows for better differentiation of disease severity and risk assessment. The findings contribute significantly to the understanding of glaucoma's impact on visual fields and intraocular pressure, offering new avenues for differential diagnosis and monitoring of optic nerve diseases. Overall, Thakoor's research represents a vital intersection of artificial intelligence and ophthalmology, potentially transforming glaucoma care through enhanced diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.
