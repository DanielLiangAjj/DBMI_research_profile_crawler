Researcher: Serge Cremers
Research Overview:
Serge Cremers' research spans a diverse array of topics, with a significant focus on clinical pharmacology, bone health, endocrine disorders, and targeted cancer therapies. His studies involve the evaluation of bone density and structure using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT), particularly in relation to conditions such as acromegaly and osteoporosis. He explores the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of various therapeutic agents, including MEK inhibitors like selumetinib for conditions such as uveal melanoma, and the implications of drug interactions on clinical outcomes. His work also investigates the roles of parathyroid hormone and vitamin D in calcium metabolism and bone remodeling. Additionally, Cremersâ€™ research includes investigating the effects of medications on complications in chronic diseases like acute kidney injury and the influence of obesity on metabolic health. Through a combination of modeling, simulation, and empirical studies, his contributions aim to enhance understanding and treatment outcomes in these complex clinical settings, focusing on precision medicine within rare disorders and common chronic conditions alike.
