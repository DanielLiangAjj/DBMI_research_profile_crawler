Researcher: Elias Issa
Research Overview:
Elias Issa's research delves into the intricate fields of biological sciences and neuroscience, with a particular focus on sensory neuroscience. Utilizing Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism alongside advanced techniques like the LexA - LexAop binary expression system, his work explores genetic regulation and neural dynamics. His studies encompass visual and auditory perception, investigating how primates, including humans and rhesus macaques, process complex stimuli such as faces and objects in the visual cortex and the auditory cortex. Additionally, Issa emphasizes educational initiatives, notably through collaborations that integrate high school students into university-level genetics courses, promoting STEM engagement and enhancing the learning experience. His investigations span various aspects of neurophysiology, including electrophysiology and sleep, underscoring the significance of spatial organization and neural networks in cognitive functions like recognition and perception. Overall, Issa's multidisciplinary approach integrates genetics, neurobiology, and educational outreach, contributing valuable insights into sensory processing and cognitive neuroscience.
