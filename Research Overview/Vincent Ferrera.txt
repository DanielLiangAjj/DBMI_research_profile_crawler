Researcher: Vincent Ferrera
Research Overview:
Vincent Ferrera's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics within neuroscience, focusing on the interplay between cognitive processes, decision-making, and innovative methodologies for modulating brain activity. His work prominently features the investigation of the blood-brain barrier and its implications for drug delivery, particularly utilizing non-invasive techniques such as focused ultrasound and microbubbles. Ferrera explores functional connectivity within brain networks through computational models, examining learning processes such as reinforcement, serial learning, and transitive inference in both non-human primates and humans. His studies contribute to understanding complex behaviors, including attention, categorization, and the integration of sensory information during decision-making tasks. By employing advanced neuroimaging techniques, electrophysiological recordings, and neuromodulation approaches like optogenetics and chemogenetics, Ferrera aims to unravel the neural underpinnings of cognition and behavior, offering insights that could inform therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. Overall, his research bridges the gap between basic neuroscience and applied clinical practice, with a strong emphasis on understanding the mechanistic foundations of learning and decision-making processes.
