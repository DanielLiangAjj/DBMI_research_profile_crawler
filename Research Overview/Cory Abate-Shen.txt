Researcher: Cory Abate-Shen
Research Overview:
Cory Abate-Shen's research focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer and its progression, emphasizing the roles of metabolic pathways, signaling cascades, and the tumor microenvironment. His work explores key factors such as NKX3.1, Wnt signaling, and oxidative stress, as well as the impact of treatments like Metformin and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors in precision medicine strategies. Using a variety of sophisticated models, including genetically-engineered mouse models and patient-derived organoids, he investigates cancer differentiation, drug resistance, and the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in the development of metastases, particularly in relation to bone involvement. His studies also extend to single-cell RNA sequencing and multiomics approaches to establish predictive and prognostic signatures for prostate cancer. Overall, Abate-Shen's research aims to unravel the complexities of cancer genetics to enhance preventive and treatment strategies, ensuring a move towards personalized care in prostate cancer management, thereby contributing substantially to the field of precision cancer prevention and treatment.
