Researcher: George Mentis
Research Overview:
George Mentis' research primarily focuses on spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and motor neuron diseases, particularly investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction in motor neurons. His work extensively covers the role of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is crucial in SMA, along with other relevant factors such as serotonin signaling, RNA processing, and the impact of microglial inflammation on motor neuron survival. Mentis employs various model organisms, including genetically modified mice and embryonic stem cells, to explore the excitability and firing patterns of motor neurons and their interactions with sensory neurons within neuromuscular circuits. His research integrates aspects of cell biology, electrophysiological phenomena, and the regulation of synaptic structure and function, aiming to unveil potential therapeutic targets for regenerative strategies in neurodegenerative conditions like ALS and SMA. Through the application of advanced microscopy techniques, his studies also delve into the roles of gap junctions and classical complement pathways in modulating synaptic communications and neuronal health. Overall, Mentis' contributions enhance our understanding of the cellular and molecular dynamics at play in neuronal degeneration and regeneration processes, paving the way for innovative treatments for motor neuron diseases.
