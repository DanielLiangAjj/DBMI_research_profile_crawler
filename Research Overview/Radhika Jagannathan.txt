Researcher: Radhika Jagannathan
Research Overview:
Radhika Jagannathan's research is focused on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer Disease. Her work investigates the role of various proteins and transcription factors, including Amyloid beta-peptides, Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein, and Activating Transcription Factor 4, in the context of cellular signaling and gene expression. Utilizing model organisms like Drosophila melanogaster and in vitro systems such as HEK293 and MCF-7 cells, she explores the effects of signal transduction pathways, particularly Hippo signaling, on cell proliferation and related processes. By examining the interactions and dimerization of key proteins within these pathways, her research aims to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms that may contribute to neuronal health and the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Ultimately, her work seeks to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of neurodegeneration and identify potential therapeutic targets.
