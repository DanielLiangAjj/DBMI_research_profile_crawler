Researcher: Guohua Li
Research Overview:
Guohua Li's research predominantly focuses on the intersection of aging and safety, particularly concerning driving behavior and related health outcomes among older adults. Central themes include the impact of polypharmacy, neurodevelopmental disorders, and various medications—including opioids and cannabis—on driving safety and the risks associated with motor vehicle accidents among older populations. His work considers behavioral health aspects, such as mental health issues like depression and anxiety, alongside the epidemiology of traffic-related injuries. Furthermore, Li explores the societal implications of structural racism and socioeconomic factors that contribute to health inequalities. His findings underscore the need for targeted interventions in healthcare and public policy to enhance driving safety, minimize crash risks, and support the quality of life among older adults navigating driving cessation. Overall, Li’s research aims to inform strategies that promote safer driving practices and better health management for aging individuals, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes and safer communities.
