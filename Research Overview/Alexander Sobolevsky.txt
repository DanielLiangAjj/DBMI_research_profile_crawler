Researcher: Alexander Sobolevsky
Research Overview:
Dr. Alexander Sobolevsky's research predominantly explores the intricate roles of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and ionotropic glutamate receptors in cellular functions, especially in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and excitatory neurotransmission. His studies employ advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography to elucidate the structural dynamics and gating mechanisms of TRP channels, specifically TRPM7, TRPV2, and TRPV3, alongside investigating the pharmacological modulation of these channels through various ligands, antagonists, and agonists. The integration of molecular biology approaches with single-molecule microscopy allows for a deeper understanding of calcium signaling and its implications in cellular metabolism and neurobiology. By studying the interactions of these proteins with lipid environments, he aims to develop innovative therapeutic strategies targeting cancer and neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and Parkinson's. Overall, Dr. Sobolevsky's research significantly contributes to the evolving landscape of molecular neuroscience and structural biology, emphasizing the importance of ion channels in health and disease.
