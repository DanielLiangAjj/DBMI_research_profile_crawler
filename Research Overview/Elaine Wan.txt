Researcher: Elaine Wan
Research Overview:
Elaine Wan's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics within cardiac electrophysiology, with a particular focus on arrhythmias, the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation, and the implementation of innovative electrophysiologic techniques such as catheter and surgical ablation. Her work also investigates the impact of health disparities, particularly related to gender and race, on outcomes from various cardiovascular interventions. By integrating machine learning and digital health strategies, she aims to enhance risk stratification and patient monitoring in cardiovascular care. Furthermore, her research explores the implications of COVID-19 on cardiovascular health, specifically on the incidence of post-acute sequelae such as long COVID. Overall, Wan's efforts contribute significantly to advancing understanding and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and optimizing patient outcomes across diverse populations, while addressing the challenges posed by emerging health crises.
