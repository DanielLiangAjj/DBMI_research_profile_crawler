Researcher: Stephen Tsang
Research Overview:
Stephen Tsang's research focuses on the complex interplay of genetic and metabolic factors in retinal degeneration, particularly conditions like retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). His work extensively investigates innovative gene therapy techniques, including CRISPR and prime editing, aiming for precise gene correction to address inherited retinal diseases. Tsang examines the roles of various molecular pathways, such as aerobic glycolysis, metabolic reprogramming, and the involvement of microRNAs in retinal pigment epithelium health. His studies also utilize advanced imaging modalities like optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence to analyze genotype-phenotype correlations and disease progression in patients. By integrating metabolomics and therapeutic editing approaches, his research seeks to elucidate the mechanisms of retinal degeneration and develop targeted interventions, including potential applications in precision medicine to improve patient outcomes in inherited retinal diseases.
