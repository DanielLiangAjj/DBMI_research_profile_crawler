Researcher: Serge Przedborski
Research Overview:
Serge Przedborski’s research primarily focuses on the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). His work extensively explores the roles of protein prenylation, metabolic labeling techniques, and proteomics to investigate molecular pathways and cellular responses in motor neurons and glial cells. He emphasizes the significance of RNA epigenetics, particularly involving the methyltransferase METTL3 and N6-methyladenosine modification in gene expression and disease progression. Furthermore, Przedborski’s studies utilize a range of experimental models, including transgenic mice, to elucidate the disorder's pathophysiology, mechanisms of neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Additionally, his research addresses the impact of COVID-19 on neurodegenerative processes and highlights the potential for neurorestorative strategies in combating age-related neurodegeneration. Overall, his work stands at the intersection of molecular biology, neuroscience, and therapeutic innovation, aiming to uncover novel treatment avenues for devastating neurological disorders.
