Researcher: Bianca Jones Marlin
Research Overview:
Bianca Jones Marlin's research primarily focuses on the interplay of sensory modalities—particularly auditory and olfactory cues—in shaping maternal and parental behaviors in rodents. By exploring the neural mechanisms that govern these behaviors, her work provides insights into how multisensory integration influences reproductive strategies and progeny care. The research encompasses a range of topics, including animal behavior, neurogenesis, and the implications of sensory perception on social dynamics, reflecting an interdisciplinary approach that bridges neuroscience, behavior analysis, and evolutionary biology. Through her systematic investigation, Marlin aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities underlying maternal instincts and the broader implications for mammalian social structures.
