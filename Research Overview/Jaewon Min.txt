Researcher: Jaewon Min
Research Overview:
Jaewon Min's research primarily focuses on the intricate mechanisms of DNA repair, particularly in the context of telomere biology and genomic stability. Key areas of investigation include break-induced replication (BIR), the role of proteins such as BLM and RAD52 in homologous recombination, and the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) as a cancer mechanism. He explores various therapeutic avenues, including the use of ROCK inhibitors and conditional reprogramming, to manipulate cellular responses to DNA damage and senescence, all within the framework of cellular and molecular processes like transcription-associated DNA repair and nuclear actin dynamics. By examining the biological implications of telomere shortening and the role of biomolecular condensates in DNA repair pathways, Min contributes to a deeper understanding of how genomic instability influences cancer progression and therapy resistance, paving the way for novel treatment strategies targeting telomere maintenance mechanisms and repair pathways in tumorigenesis.
