Researcher: Joseph Gogos
Research Overview:
Joseph Gogos's research primarily investigates the intricate relationships between genetic factors, neural circuitry, and cognitive functions, with a strong emphasis on schizophrenia and related neuropsychiatric conditions. His work spans various topics within neuroscience and developmental biology, including brain development, interneuron function, and the impact of specific gene mutations, such as those associated with the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome. Utilizing advanced methodologies like two-photon calcium imaging and animal models, he explores mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits, long-term memory, and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, his studies delve into the roles of neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate, in neural communication and behavior. The focus on therapeutic insights and pharmacological interventions, including the use of ketamine, highlights his commitment to translating basic research into potential treatments for psychiatric diseases. Overall, Gogos's extensive work contributes significantly to understanding the genetic and environmental underpinnings of cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric disorders.
