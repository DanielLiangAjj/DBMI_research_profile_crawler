Researcher: Jane Dodd
Research Overview:
Jane Dodd's research centers on developmental biology, primarily utilizing model organisms such as the flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius) to investigate the intricacies of embryonic development. Through advanced microscopy techniques, her work examines various environmental factors, including temperature and salinity, on the development of eggs and embryos. A significant focus of her research is on the molecular mechanisms of neuronal growth, specifically the roles of signaling pathways involving ActRIIA and BMP7, alongside the dynamics of chemotaxis and growth cone collapse. By integrating citizen science approaches and collecting data over time, Dodd not only enhances our understanding of marine biology but also contributes to broader ecological contexts such as oceanography. Her research contributes valuable insights into the developmental processes and responses of aquatic organisms to environmental changes, promoting awareness of marine ecosystems.
