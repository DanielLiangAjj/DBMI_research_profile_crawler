Researcher: Marta Olah
Research Overview:
Marta Olah's research centers around the use of advanced genomic and proteomic technologies, particularly CRISPR and functional genomics, to investigate the role of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis. Her studies leverage innovative techniques like Chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) and focus on critical molecular players, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), STAT1, and Sox9, to understand neuroinflammation and its impact on neural stem cells and aging. By examining the interactions between microglia, neurons, and the associated epigenetic and transcriptomic changes, Olah aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Her findings contribute significantly to the field of neurology by linking genetic predispositions and the epigenome's role in disease pathways, ultimately striving to uncover potential therapeutic targets for combating neurodegenerative disorders.
