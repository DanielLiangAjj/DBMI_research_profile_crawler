Researcher: Paul Sajda
Research Overview:
Paul Sajda's research predominantly centers on the interplay between neural mechanisms and cognitive processes, especially concerning attention, decision-making, and emotional regulation. His studies span various domains, including the influence of the cholinergic and noradrenergic systems, as well as the role of the locus coeruleus and basal forebrain in impulsivity and inhibitory control. Utilizing modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), Sajda investigates neural synchronization patterns, pupil-linked arousal, and the dynamics of brain connectivity in contexts ranging from depressive disorders to perceptual decision-making tasks. The integration of neuroimaging techniques with machine learning approaches enables a comprehensive exploration of brain-behavior relationships, offering insights for personalized neurostimulation therapies. Overall, Sajda's work contributes to a nuanced understanding of how cognitive processes are modulated by underlying brain networks, paving the way for advancements in treatments for mental health disorders and enhancing performance in decision-making scenarios.
