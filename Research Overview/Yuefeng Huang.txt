Researcher: Yuefeng Huang
Research Overview:
Yuefeng Huang's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focused on biomedical applications and the interactions of various materials and biological systems. Key areas of investigation include aggregation-induced emission phenomena, which are leveraged for enhancing imaging capabilities in biological contexts, including the study of cardiac troponin I levels. Huang explores the use of hydrophobic dendritic silica and paper-based materials for adsorption-catalysis removal of pollutants like hexavalent chromium, indicating a strong interest in environmental applications. Additionally, his work connects neuroscience with addiction psychiatry, investigating mechanisms of substance-related disorders, particularly involving opioids, and the neural underpinnings in regions like the prefrontal cortex and striatum. Huangâ€™s studies also delve into immune responses, examining the roles of cytokines such as IL-33 and how they interact with lymphatic endothelial cells in the context of helminth infections. Furthermore, the research extends to understanding gut motility and neuroimmunomodulation through cellular signaling pathways, highlighting the complex interplay between the immune system and neurological functions. Overall, Huang's contributions significantly bridge materials science, neurobiology, and immunology, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies and environmental solutions.
