Researcher: Laura Johnston
Research Overview:
Laura Johnston's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focused on the intricacies of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, cancer biology, and immune modulation. Her work significantly contributes to understanding mechanisms of cellular competition and the roles of various signaling pathways—particularly relating to tumor suppressor proteins like Trp53—as well as the effects of transplantation conditioning on patient outcomes. Additionally, Johnston investigates patient quality of life post-transplantation, the nuances of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and the effects of malnutrition and systemic health on older adults. Her studies utilize advanced techniques, including laser microdissection and single-cell RNA sequencing, to dissect complex cellular interactions and immune profiles. Through her exploration of both pediatric and adult populations, particularly in conditions like acute lymphoblastic leukemia and multiple myeloma, Johnston aims to enhance treatment strategies and improve clinical outcomes, ultimately bridging the gap between translational research and clinical application. Her multifaceted approach highlights the importance of tailored therapies and the need for continued innovation in the management of hematologic malignancies and transplantation challenges.
