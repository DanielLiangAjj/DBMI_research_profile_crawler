Researcher: Sarah Rossetti
Research Overview:
Sarah Rossetti's research focuses on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into healthcare systems to enhance clinical decision-making and patient safety, particularly in inpatient and intensive care settings. Through a multifaceted approach that includes the development of early warning systems, clinical decision support systems, and risk assessment tools, her work aims to alleviate nurse burnout, streamline nursing workflows, and improve the documentation processes associated with electronic health records (EHRs). By employing qualitative research methodologies, randomized controlled trials, and advanced data mining techniques such as natural language processing, Rossetti examines the challenges and strategies related to nursing informatics and health information technology. Her studies also explore the impact of effective communication and collaboration among healthcare providers, emphasizing the importance of engaging patients through tools like patient portals and chatbots. Overall, her contributions significantly advance the quality of nursing practice, healthcare delivery, and patient outcomes, while addressing critical issues such as workload management and health policy within clinical environments.
