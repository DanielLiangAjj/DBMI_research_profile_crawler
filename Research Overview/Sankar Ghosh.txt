Researcher: Sankar Ghosh
Research Overview:
Sankar Ghosh's research encompasses a wide array of intricate topics primarily focused on the intersections of autoimmunity, cancer, and inflammation. His work utilizes advanced methodologies such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), next-generation sequencing, and molecular dynamics simulations to explore genetic predispositions and biomolecular mechanisms underpinning autoimmune diseases, particularly in the contexts of head and neck cancers and type 1 diabetes. Ghosh's investigations into long noncoding RNAs, specifically lncRNAs like Lnc13 and LINC00173, highlight their roles in transcriptional regulation and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, he utilizes intricate bioinformatics techniques to analyze gene variants linked to various forms of cancer and autoimmune conditions in diverse populations, notably in Northeast India, contributing valuable insights into genetic diversity and population genetics. His exploration of drug repurposing and in silico drug design aims at identifying novel therapeutic avenues against cancer and autoimmune diseases, reinforcing the importance of integrating computational biology with experimental studies to enhance our understanding of these complex health issues. Overall, Sankar Ghosh's research signifies a robust commitment to unveiling the molecular frameworks that govern immune responses and tumorigenesis, with a particular emphasis on genetic interactions and environmental influences inherent to diverse populations.
