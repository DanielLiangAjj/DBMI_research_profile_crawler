Researcher: Kazuki Sugahara
Research Overview:
Kazuki Sugahara's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on pancreatic adenocarcinoma and innovative approaches to improve treatment outcomes. His work highlights the implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols in pancreatic surgery, aiming to address healthcare disparities and the social determinants of health that influence patient access and quality of care. Sugahara explores the complications arising from pancreatectomy, including post-pancreatectomy diabetes and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, while evaluating factors impacting the quality of life and survivorship among patients. In tandem with clinical studies, he investigates advanced drug delivery systems using nanomedicine and tumor-targeting peptides, such as Neuropilin-1 and silver nanoparticles, to enhance therapeutic efficacy against peritoneal carcinomatosis and other malignancies. His research employs sophisticated methodologies, including next-generation DNA sequencing and magnetic resonance imaging, to facilitate better diagnostic and treatment strategies in oncology, contributing to the broader understanding of cancer biology and therapy. By integrating these areas, Sugahara aims to advance patient outcomes through targeted, personalized approaches in cancer care.
