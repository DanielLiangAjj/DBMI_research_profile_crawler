Researcher: Emily Tsai
Research Overview:
Emily Tsai's research predominantly focuses on the cardiovascular implications of COVID-19, particularly its impact on myocardial health and endothelial function. Through single-cell analyses and bioinformatics techniques, she investigates the molecular pathophysiology of cardiac injury, myocardial inflammation, and the presence of microthrombi associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Her studies extend to understanding various forms of cardiomyopathy, including peripartum cardiomyopathy and right ventricular dysfunction, facilitated by technologies like cardiac imaging and autopsy evaluations. Tsai's work emphasizes the significance of thromboinflammation, the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and the broader effects of COVID-19 on cardiac tissues, highlighting the long-term outcomes on heart function and the potential for heart failure. Overall, her research addresses urgent questions regarding the cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19, utilizing a comprehensive approach that intersects cardiology, molecular biology, and clinical outcomes.
