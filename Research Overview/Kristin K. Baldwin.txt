Researcher: Kristin K. Baldwin
Research Overview:
Kristin K. Baldwin's research focuses on the intersection of developmental biology and regenerative medicine, particularly in the context of neurodegeneration and disease modeling. Her work encompasses a variety of topics including blastocyst complementation, interspecies chimeras, and the use of pluripotent stem cells, particularly induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to model complex brain diseases such as Friedreich ataxia and other neurodegenerative conditions. Baldwin employs gene editing techniques and histone deacetylase inhibitors to explore neuronal diversity and brain regeneration, examining gene regulatory networks and transcriptomics to understand the underlying mechanisms of disease. Her research extends to optimizing the cultivation and reprogramming of vascular smooth muscle cells, contributing to advancements in cardiovascular disease models as well. Through her innovative approaches, she aims to unravel the complexities of neural circuits and cell differentiation, ultimately seeking therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases while also addressing broader implications for regenerative medicine and developmental processes in both animal models and humans.
