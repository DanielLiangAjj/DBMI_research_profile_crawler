Researcher: Kapil V. Ramachandran
Research Overview:
Kapil V. Ramachandran's research integrates a multifaceted approach to understanding complex neurological conditions such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease and congenital heart defects, particularly with a focus on the roles of proteins and neuroinflammation in neuronal health and disease. His work emphasizes the significance of apolipoprotein E (APOE) as a risk factor in neurodegeneration, exploring its interactions with microglia and the vasculature. Additionally, he investigates mechanisms of neuronal activity, proteasome function, and the implications of calcium signaling in various biological models, including murine and zebrafish systems. His studies delve into cell differentiation, neuronal plasticity, and the impact of therapeutics on proteolytic processes. Overall, Ramachandran's research aims to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, contributing valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies.
