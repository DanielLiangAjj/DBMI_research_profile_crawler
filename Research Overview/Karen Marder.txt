Researcher: Karen Marder
Research Overview:
Karen Marder's research predominantly focuses on neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Her work explores genetic influences, such as mutations in GBA1 and LRRK2, and their implications for disease progression and clinical outcomes. Marder employs advanced methodologies in clinical trial design, integrating machine learning, adaptive lasso, and informatics to optimize participant selection and recruitment processes, while addressing social determinants of health. Additionally, her studies frequently address genetic counseling and testing, highlighting the psychosocial impacts of genetic information on patients and communities. Marder's research also encompasses cognitive assessments, lifestyle factors, and biomarkers, aiming for early detection and preventive measures in both diseases. Her extensive work contributes significantly to the understanding and management of neurodegenerative conditions, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches in medical research and healthcare delivery.
