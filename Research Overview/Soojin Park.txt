Researcher: Soojin Park
Research Overview:
Soojin Park's research focuses on the complex interplay of neurocritical care, particularly concerning cerebral pathologies such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, and their associated complications including vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia. The researcher emphasizes the importance of individualized care and outcomes, utilizing advanced monitoring techniques such as neuromonitoring, multimodal imaging, and physiologic data evaluation. Park is also keenly interested in the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in prognostication, health equity, and optimizing outcomes in critical care settings. Additionally, the impact of demographic factors such as race, sex differences, and age on cerebral injury and recovery is a recurring theme, indicating a broader commitment to addressing disparities in healthcare outcomes. The researcher integrates emerging technologies like rotational thromboelastometry and big data analytics to refine treatment protocols and improve patient care strategies in neurocritical disease management, exemplifying a multidisciplinary approach to tackling intricate medical challenges.
