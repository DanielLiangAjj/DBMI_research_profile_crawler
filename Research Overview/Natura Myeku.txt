Researcher: Natura Myeku
Research Overview:
Natura Myeku's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms underlying Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, particularly tauopathies. Central to this work is the investigation of 5-HT4 agonists and their potential role in synaptic therapy aimed at mitigating cognitive dysfunction associated with these diseases. Myeku examines the involvement of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in tau protein aggregation and degradation, exploring how molecular chaperones and cyclic AMP pathways influence these processes. The research utilizes various animal models, including transgenic mice, and employs techniques such as immunoblotting and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to uncover the biological interactions and signal transduction pathways that may hold therapeutic promise. Overall, Myeku's work is poised to enhance our understanding of molecular targets for drug discovery in the realm of neurodegenerative diseases.
