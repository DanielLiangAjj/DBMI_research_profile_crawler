Researcher: Lorraine Symington
Research Overview:
Lorraine Symington's research primarily focuses on understanding the mechanisms of DNA damage repair and maintaining genome integrity, particularly through the lens of homologous recombination (HR) in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). Her studies explore key proteins involved in DNA repair, such as Exo1, Mre11, Rad51, and Sgs1, emphasizing their roles in various DNA repair pathways like break-induced replication and single-strand annealing. Symington's work highlights the importance of DNA double-strand breaks, checkpoint pathways, and chromatin dynamics in the context of genetic stability and genome rearrangements. By utilizing techniques such as single-molecule tracking and fluorescent protein tagging, her research elucidates how different repair strategies operate under distinct cellular conditions, thereby contributing to our understanding of genomic instability linked to diseases such as cancer. Overall, her findings significantly advance our comprehension of genetic processes critical for cell survival and proliferation in response to DNA damage.
