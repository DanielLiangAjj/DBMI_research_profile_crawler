Researcher: Peter Sims
Research Overview:
Peter Sims' research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focusing on cancer biology, immunology, and neurobiology. His work extensively investigates the roles and dynamics of various cell types in both the tumor microenvironment and the immune system, particularly focusing on glioblastoma and colorectal cancer. Utilizing techniques such as single-cell genomics, time-resolved fate mapping, and multiplexed lineage tracing, he explores lineage hierarchies and cellular interactions to better understand tissue regeneration, stem cell behavior, and the mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer. Additionally, Sims delves into the immunological aspects of diseases, highlighting the functions of T cells and macrophages in both tumor immunity and responses to infections such as COVID-19. His research also touches on neurodegenerative diseases, examining dopaminergic neuron function in models of Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Overall, Peter Sims' multifaceted approach bridges cellular biology and therapeutic development, aiming to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and paving the way for innovative treatment strategies in oncology and immunology.
