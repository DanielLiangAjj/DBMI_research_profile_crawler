Researcher: Nicolino Dorrello
Research Overview:
Nicolino Dorrello's research focuses on critical care and fluid management, particularly in the pediatric population and trauma settings. His work includes investigating fluid resuscitation techniques, with a strong emphasis on the feasibility and efficacy of different intravenous infusions and their impact on extracellular fluid dynamics. In the context of lung health, he explores the pathophysiology of conditions like cystic fibrosis and acute lung injury, studying biomarkers and the underlying mechanisms of inflammation and pulmonary function. His research extends to bioengineering approaches, including decellularization and recellularization processes aimed at lung regeneration and support, as well as the development of pulmonary drug delivery systems. Additionally, Dorrello examines viral evolution and host-pathogen interactions in central nervous system infections, contributing to a deeper understanding of critical illnesses and therapeutic strategies in both animal models and human applications. Overall, his multifaceted research integrates critical care practices with innovative biomedical engineering solutions to enhance patient outcomes in respiratory and trauma-related health issues.
