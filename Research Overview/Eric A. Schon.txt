Researcher: Eric A. Schon
Research Overview:
Eric A. Schon's research focuses on the intricate relationship between mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. His work emphasizes the role of mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM) in cellular functions such as lipid metabolism, cholesterol transport, and the dynamics of mitochondrial DNA. By exploring the mechanisms behind amyloid-beta peptide processing and the pathways involving autophagy and oxidative phosphorylation, he investigates key contributors to neuronal degeneration. Additionally, Schon contributes to understanding how mutations in mitochondrial DNA can lead to various mitochondrial diseases, thereby paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions. His findings also highlight the significance of lipid rafts and membrane microdomains in neuronal health, underscoring the importance of cellular compartmentalization in maintaining metabolic balance and function. Overall, his research integrates cellular and structural biology to address the underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration, which may inform new strategies for treatment and management of these debilitating conditions.
