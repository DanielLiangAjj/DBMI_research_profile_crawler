Researcher: Steven Spitalnik
Research Overview:
Steven Spitalnik's research predominantly focuses on the complex interactions of erythrocytes (red blood cells), oxidative stress, and their implications in transfusion medicine and hematology. His investigations explore the role of antioxidants such as ergothioneine and fish oil in mitigating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation, which are critical in preserving erythrocyte deformability and function during storage, often referred to as storage lesions. Additionally, Spitalnik's work addresses the impacts of genetic variations on erythrocyte performance, particularly under the stress of conditions like anemia and COVID-19. Through a combination of lipidomics, metabolomics, and comparative biology, he examines the biochemical pathways affecting red blood cell morphology and aging, highlighting their significance in transfusion reactions and disease management in diverse populations. His contributions aim to optimize blood transfusion practices while advancing our understanding of erythrocyte biology in health and disease.
