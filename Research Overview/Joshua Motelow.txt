Researcher: Joshua Motelow
Research Overview:
Joshua Motelow's research predominantly focuses on the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of neurological disorders, particularly Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and various forms of epilepsy, including temporal lobe epilepsy and absence seizures. His work employs advanced genomic analyses such as whole exome sequencing and rare-variant analyses, exploring allele frequencies, genetic predisposition, and burden testing to identify significant genetic variations associated with these conditions. Additionally, Motelow investigates the dynamics of consciousness and its relation to neurological function through optogenetics and neurostimulation techniques, aiming to elucidate how different brain regions contribute to awareness during various states, including sleep and seizure activity. His interdisciplinary approach combines genomic mapping with neurophysiological techniques, thereby offering insights into treatment-resistant forms of schizophrenia and other complex disorders. Overall, his research aims to bridge the gap between genetic data and clinical manifestations, potentially informing novel therapeutic strategies in neurology.
