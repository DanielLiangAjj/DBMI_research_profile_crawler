Researcher: Virginia Lorenzi
Research Overview:
Virginia Lorenzi's research primarily focuses on the intersection of genetic factors and health outcomes, particularly regarding breast cancer risk assessment and early detection. By analyzing common genetic variants and their relationship to family history, Lorenzi explores the implications of both monogenic and polygenic risk scores in diverse populations, including adolescents and children. Her work emphasizes the importance of integrating genomic data with electronic health records to enhance patient care and communication between healthcare providers and families. Lorenzi's contributions also address the ethical aspects of confidentiality and the effective use of patient portals in managing health information. Overall, her research aims to advance understanding of genetic risks and improve strategies for cancer detection while enhancing healthcare delivery through innovative informatics solutions and interinstitutional collaboration.
