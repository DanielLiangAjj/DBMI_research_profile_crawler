Researcher: Yaakov Stern
Research Overview:
Yaakov Stern's research primarily focuses on the interplay between cognitive aging, dementia, and various neurobiological factors. His extensive body of work includes studies on Alzheimerâ€™s disease, emphasizing the roles of amyloid beta and tau proteins, and how neuroimaging techniques, including MRI and PET scans, help in understanding cerebral changes associated with cognitive decline. His investigations extend to the concept of cognitive reserve, exploring how cognitive engagement, lifestyle factors, and education can mitigate cognitive impairments in aging populations. Stern also addresses racial and ethnic disparities in dementia, examining how social and economic factors influence cognitive health outcomes. Additionally, his research considers the implications of cerebrovascular health, the impact of physical activity, and the benefits of nutritional approaches, such as the Mediterranean diet, on cognitive maintenance. Overall, Stern's work contributes significantly to our understanding of the biological and psychological underpinnings of cognitive aging, offering insights that may guide preventative and therapeutic strategies for age-related cognitive disorders.
