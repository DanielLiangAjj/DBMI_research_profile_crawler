Researcher: Janet Metcalfe
Research Overview:
Janet Metcalfe's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics related to cognitive processes, learning, and decision-making. Central to her work are themes such as discovery learning, interactive feedback mechanisms, and the ways individuals learn from errors through concepts like productive failure and test effects. She explores the nuances of metacognition, consciousness, and curiosity, emphasizing their roles in memory processes and learning efficiency. Her studies also delve into complex judgments related to agency and morality, particularly in scenarios like the trolley problem, and their implications for decision-making. Furthermore, Metcalfe investigates neurological correlates of these cognitive processes using tools such as EEG and ERP while considering factors like stress, aging, and disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Her research reflects a commitment to understanding human cognition across diverse contexts and populations, contributing significantly to the fields of psychology, education, and applied cognitive science. 

In summary, Metcalfe's work aims to illuminate the intricacies of how we learn, remember, and make decisions, incorporating innovative methodologies and elucidating the psychological and neurobiological underpinnings of these processes.
