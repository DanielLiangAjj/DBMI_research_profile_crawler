Researcher: Nicholas Arpaia
Research Overview:
Nicholas Arpaia's research focuses on the intersection of immunology, metabolism, and cancer biology, with a particular emphasis on the roles of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in various disease contexts, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver fibrosis, and malignancies such as bladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. His work elucidates the mechanisms of insulin resistance and gut inflammation, exploring how interactions between intestinal microbiota and host immune responses influence systemic metabolic processes and tumor microenvironments. Notable themes in his research include the implications of drug development and immunotherapy, particularly in enhancing immune responses against tumors and understanding the contributions of cellular signaling pathways mediated by receptors such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and HGF. By integrating concepts of mucosal immunity, nutrient metabolism (specifically tryptophan), and the characterization of tumor-associated immune cells, Arpaia aims to advance therapeutic strategies that target immune modulation and improve patient outcomes in cancer and chronic liver diseases. Overall, his research sheds light on the complex interplay of immune regulation and metabolic health, offering insights that are critical for innovative treatment approaches in oncology and hepatology.
