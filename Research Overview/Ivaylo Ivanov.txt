Researcher: Ivaylo Ivanov
Research Overview:
Ivaylo Ivanov’s research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily focused on molecular biology, genomic stability, and the interplay between microbiota and immune responses. His work critically examines DNA repair mechanisms, utilizing techniques such as X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy to investigate structural biology aspects, particularly in the context of cancer-related proteins like phosphodiesterases. Additionally, Ivanov explores the roles of various immune cells, including Th17 cells and Tregs, in modulating mucosal immunity and the gut microbiome, emphasizing the significance of segmented filamentous bacteria in the intestinal environment. His studies on translational control and ribosomal dynamics aim to elucidate the regulatory layers governing protein biosynthesis, further linking these mechanisms to metabolic syndrome and obesity. Through experimental models, including germ-free mice and transgenic cells, and employing advanced computational techniques, he contributes significantly to understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation, signaling pathways, and potential therapeutic interventions in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Overall, Ivanov’s interdisciplinary research integrates structural, genomic, and immunological perspectives, paving the way for potential novel strategies in biomedicine and therapeutics.
