Researcher: David Lamb
Research Overview:
David Lamb's research focuses on the intricate roles of cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP121A1 and CYP51, in various biological processes, including their catalytic mechanisms, substrate specificity, and structural dynamics. His work emphasizes the evolution of these enzymes within different organisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, deep-sea fish, and various fungi, illustrating how adaptations in their active sites influence enzymatic reactions. Additionally, Lamb explores the impact of interleukins and signaling pathways in disease contexts, particularly related to lung injury, asthma, and fibrosis, employing diverse methodologies such as molecular dynamics simulations, crystallography, and in vivo models. His interdisciplinary approach also extends to precision agriculture, leveraging artificial intelligence for disease detection in crops, indicating a significant application of his findings beyond basic research. Overall, Lamb's contributions significantly enhance our understanding of enzyme biology, disease mechanisms, and agricultural advancements.
