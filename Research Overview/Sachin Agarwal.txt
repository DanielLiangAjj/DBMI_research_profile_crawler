Researcher: Sachin Agarwal
Research Overview:
Sachin Agarwalâ€™s research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily focused on neurocritical care, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest survivorship. His work investigates critical outcomes related to the management of brain injuries, utilizing advanced techniques like rotational thromboelastometry and machine learning to enhance prognostication and treatment strategies. A significant emphasis is placed on the impact of psychological factors, caregiver burden, and the long-term consequences of acute conditions such as cardiac arrest and stroke, specifically examining post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) in young adults and various demographic differences related to sex and ethnicity. Additionally, Agarwal explores the complexities of cerebral blood flow regulation and the implications of thromboembolic events during pregnancy and postpartum, thus bridging a connection between maternal health and critical care outcomes. His research aims to improve patient-centered approaches to care, emphasizing the importance of family involvement and quality of life measures in the recovery process of cardiac arrest and cerebrovascular events. Through these varied yet interlinked investigations, Agarwal contributes significantly to the understanding and management of critical conditions that influence both immediate and long-term patient outcomes.
