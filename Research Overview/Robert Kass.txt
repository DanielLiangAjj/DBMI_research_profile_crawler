Researcher: Robert Kass
Research Overview:
Robert Kass's research primarily focuses on the biochemistry and cell biology of ion channels, particularly the KCNQ1 potassium channel, which is implicated in long QT syndrome (LQTS) and various related arrhythmias. His work integrates techniques from both chemical and computational biology to explore ion channel regulation, trafficking, and the underlying mechanisms of channelopathies, including the role of phosphorylation and calmodulin in ion channel functionality. Kass employs advanced modeling methods, such as Compartmental Hodgkin-Huxley models and generalized linear models, to understand neuronal activity and its implications in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology, particularly in cardiomyocyte behavior in response to pharmacological agents like mexiletine and propranolol. His research extends into the realms of disease modeling using induced pluripotent stem cells and high-throughput screening methodologies for drug development targeting arrhythmias and pulmonary hypertension. By combining electrophysiology, neural data analysis, and statistical modeling, Kass aims to elucidate complex interactions within biological systems, shedding light on the statistical issues related to neural encoding and connectivity. Overall, his interdisciplinary approach significantly contributes to the understanding of heart diseases and the development of therapeutic strategies.
