Researcher: Eric Kandel
Research Overview:
Eric Kandel's research spans a wide array of topics primarily centered around the mechanisms of learning and memory, emphasizing the role of molecular and cellular processes in synaptic plasticity, neuronal function, and behavior. His work investigates various RNA-binding proteins, including CPEB3, and their roles in biomolecular condensates such as P bodies, along with the implications for long-term memory and synaptic modifications. Utilizing models like Aplysia and mice, Kandel's studies demonstrate how neurotrophins, neurotransmitters, and signaling pathways contribute to neural plasticity and the effects of substances like cannabis and cocaine on cognition and addiction. His exploration of behavioral screens and genetic influences on learning underlines the interplay between environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Overall, Kandel's contributions have advanced our understanding of neuronal function, the biology of memory, and the intricate relationship between genes and behavior, establishing foundational insights into the neurobiological bases of learning and cognitive disorders.
