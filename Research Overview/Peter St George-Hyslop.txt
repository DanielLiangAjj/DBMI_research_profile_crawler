Researcher: Peter St George-Hyslop
Research Overview:
Peter St George-Hyslop's research predominantly focuses on the molecular and genetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and related conditions such as Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia. His work encompasses a broad range of topics including the role of amyloid-beta and tau proteins in disease pathology, the genetic and environmental risk factors influencing onset and progression, and the involvement of neuroinflammation mediated by microglia. St George-Hyslop investigates mechanisms like retromer-mediated endosomal transport, lipid metabolism, and local RNA translation within neuronal cells, which are pivotal in understanding neurodegeneration. Additionally, he utilizes advanced techniques such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), molecular imaging, and proteomics to uncover biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. His interdisciplinary approach combines genetics, biochemistry, and imaging, contributing significantly to the knowledge of cognitive decline and informing future strategies for prevention and treatment of dementia.
