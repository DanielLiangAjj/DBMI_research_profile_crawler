Researcher: Daniel Freedberg
Research Overview:
Daniel Freedberg's research extensively investigates the complexities of gastrointestinal health, drug resistance, and the microbiome in critically ill patients. Key areas of focus include the prevalence and implications of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) such as Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and Clostridioides difficile, particularly in the context of intensive care units (ICUs). His work highlights the impact of altered gut microbiota, the role of microbiome therapeutics, and dietary interventions like enteral and parenteral nutrition on patient outcomes, especially in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), dysphagia, and obesity. Freedberg also explores the intersection of COVID-19 with gastrointestinal symptoms and microbial dysbiosis, emphasizing the need for effective prevention and treatment strategies. His research methodology encompasses a mix of epidemiological studies, clinical trials, and innovative statistical modeling, contributing valuable insights for improving healthcare practices surrounding gastrointestinal disorders and antimicrobial resistance.
