Researcher: Amy Rumora
Research Overview:
Amy Rumora's research focuses on the intricate relationships between metabolic disorders, particularly diabetes, obesity, and their associated complications such as dyslipidemia and peripheral neuropathy. Her work emphasizes the role of bioenergetics, mitochondrial dysfunction, and alterations in lipid metabolism in these conditions. Utilizing mouse models and advanced omics techniques, Rumora explores the pathophysiology of diabetes and its impact on the peripheral nervous system, including the mechanisms underlying diabetic peripheral neuropathy. She examines how factors like high-fat diets and dysbiosis contribute to metabolic syndrome and prediabetes, integrating concepts from lipidomics and metabolomics to uncover insights into the immune system, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Overall, her research aims to identify novel therapeutic strategies for preventing and managing diabetes-related complications, thereby advancing our understanding of these widespread health issues.
