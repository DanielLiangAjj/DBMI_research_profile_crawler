Researcher: Muredach Reilly
Research Overview:
Muredach Reilly's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationships between metabolic processes, genetic predispositions, and cardiovascular diseases. His work emphasizes the roles of various molecular factors such as long non-coding RNAs, inflammation markers, and adipokines in conditions including obesity, atherosclerosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Reilly's investigations utilize advanced methodologies like single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, and genome-wide association studies to dissect the molecular underpinnings of cardiovascular pathology and predict outcomes related to heart health. Moreover, his research addresses critical health disparities and employs innovative strategies including telegenetics and machine learning to enhance clinical care and outcomes for patients affected by cardiovascular diseases. Overall, Reilly's contributions significantly deepen our understanding of how genetic and environmental factors converge to influence cardiovascular health, providing insights that are vital for developing precision medicine approaches in cardiology.
