Researcher: Sarah Woolley
Research Overview:
Sarah Woolley's research delves into the intricate dynamics of auditory perception and vocal communication within animal species, particularly focusing on songbirds like zebra finches. Her work explores how various biological and environmental factors, including sex differences and social experiences, shape learning and preference in vocalization. By employing techniques such as auditory fMRI and electrophysiology, she investigates the neural mechanisms underlying auditory processing, social decision-making, and mating preferences. The intersection of neuroendocrine influences, dopamine pathways, and social behavior networks underscores the evolutionary significance of vocal communication in avian species. Additionally, Woolley examines the broader implications of these findings in relation to other animals, including reptiles and mammals, thereby contributing valuable insights to the fields of neuroscience, animal behavior, and evolutionary biology. Overall, her research enhances our understanding of the complexities involved in auditory communication and its role in social interactions across species.
