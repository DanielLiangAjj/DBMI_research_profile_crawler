Researcher: Megan Sykes
Research Overview:
Megan Sykes's research encompasses a diverse range of topics centered around transplantation immunology, particularly focusing on graft-versus-host response, tolerance, and the complexities of organ transplants such as kidney and intestinal transplantation. Key aspects of her work include the analysis of the T-cell receptor repertoire through methods like single-cell transcriptomics and TCRβ sequencing, highlighting the importance of T cells in immune responses, rejection mechanisms, and autoimmunity, notably in conditions like Crohn’s disease and Type 1 diabetes. She explores innovative strategies for inducing tolerance and facilitating mixed chimerism, emphasizing xenotransplantation and donor-specific tolerance to enhance graft survival and mitigate rejection risks. Her research also extends to the implications of infections, like SARS-CoV-2, on transplant recipients, and investigates immune responses in various models including humanized mice and non-human primates. Through her work, Sykes contributes significantly to the understanding of immune regulation, the interplay between transplant immunology and autoimmunity, and potential therapeutic approaches for improving transplant outcomes and patient care.
