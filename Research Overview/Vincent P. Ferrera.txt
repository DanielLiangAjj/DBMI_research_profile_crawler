Researcher: Vincent P. Ferrera
Research Overview:
Vincent P. Ferrera's research is at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral psychology, focusing primarily on the mechanisms of cognitive processes such as decision-making, learning, and memory. His work employs a combination of advanced neuroimaging techniques, including functional MRI (fMRI) and focused ultrasound, to explore the functional connectivity of brain networks and the implications of the blood-brain barrier in drug delivery systems. Noteworthy among his studies is the investigation of transitive inference and relational learning, which examines how individuals categorize and make decisions based on relational representations. Utilizing non-human primate models, Ferrera also delves into the neurobiological underpinnings of behavior, assessing the effects of neuromodulation and various learning paradigms on cognitive performance. His extensive use of machine learning and computational biology approaches enhances the understanding of the brain's complex functions, particularly in the context of addiction and risk-taking behavior. Overall, Ferrera's multifaceted research contributes significant insights into the cognitive processes associated with learning and decision-making, while advancing methodologies for exploring brain functionality and therapeutics.
