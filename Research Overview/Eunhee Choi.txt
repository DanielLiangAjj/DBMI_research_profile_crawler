Researcher: Eunhee Choi
Research Overview:
Eunhee Choi's research primarily focuses on the complex interactions between hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and related health outcomes across various demographics, including ethnicity and age. A significant emphasis is placed on investigating blood pressure management techniques such as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, home blood pressure monitoring, and the impact of different antihypertensive agents. The researcher explores the implications of hypertension on morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations, and examines the genetic and metabolic factors contributing to insulin resistance and diabetes. Additionally, Choi investigates health disparities in various healthcare settings, including emergency departments and critical care environments, particularly concerning treatment adherence and disease outcomes. The work also extends to cancer research, studying the role of biomarkers, genetic predisposition, and treatment responses in colorectal and lung cancers. This diverse focus highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in understanding and mitigating the healthcare challenges posed by chronic diseases like hypertension and their systemic effects.
