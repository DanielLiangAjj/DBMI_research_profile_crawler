Researcher: Liza Pon
Research Overview:
Liza Pon's research centers on the intricate relationship between ageing, mitochondrial function, and the cellular mechanisms that govern oxidative stress responses. A significant focus is placed on the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cellular senescence and the longevity of organisms, especially utilizing the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Her work employs advanced microscopy techniques, including super-resolution and live-cell imaging, to investigate mitochondrial dynamics, quality control processes, and the cytoskeletal interactions that contribute to organelle function and inheritance during asymmetric cell division. Pon's studies delve into pathways such as mitophagy, lipophagy, and unfolded protein responses, shedding light on how cellular homeostasis is maintained under stress conditions. Furthermore, her exploration of the lipid droplet proteome and the involvement of signaling pathways linked to sirtuins and proteostasis contributes valuable insights into the cellular aging process and potential therapeutic targets for age-related disorders. Overall, her interdisciplinary approach integrates cell biology, genetics, and molecular biology to unravel the complexities of mitochondrial health and its implications for ageing at both cellular and organismal levels.
