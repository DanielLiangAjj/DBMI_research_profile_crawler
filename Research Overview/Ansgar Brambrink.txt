Researcher: Ansgar Brambrink
Research Overview:
Ansgar Brambrink's research focuses on the impact of anesthetics on brain development and neurotoxicity, particularly within the context of pediatric anesthesia. His studies employ neuroimaging techniques to analyze the effects of various anesthetics such as isoflurane, propofol, and sevoflurane on the immature brains of non-human primates. Key areas of exploration include the mechanisms of neurotoxicity, inflammation, and apoptosis in relation to anesthetic exposure during crucial developmental periods. Additionally, his work investigates neurobehavioral outcomes, examining how these anesthetic-related changes in the brain affect social behavior and cognitive function over time. Through comprehensive modeling and experimental approaches, Brambrink aims to provide guidelines for safer anesthetic practices in pediatric settings, emphasizing the importance of understanding drug-related neurodevelopmental impacts to enhance patient care and outcomes.
