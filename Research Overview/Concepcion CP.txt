Researcher: Concepcion CP
Research Overview:
Concepcion CP's research focuses on the intricate role of microRNAs and non-coding RNAs in cancer biology, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Utilizing advanced methodologies such as CRISPR gene editing, mass spectrometry, and high-throughput nucleotide sequencing, the researcher investigates the interplay between various molecular players, including Argonaute proteins like Ago2, transcription factors, and protein kinases, in regulating gene expression and tumor transformation. The studies include the use of animal models, especially genetically engineered and knockout mice, to explore disease mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment outcomes. The findings contribute significantly to the understanding of the molecular underpinnings of lung neoplasms, highlighting potential therapeutic targets and pathways involved in cancer progression and metastasis, while also examining implications for immunotherapy strategies in both male and female subjects across various age groups.
