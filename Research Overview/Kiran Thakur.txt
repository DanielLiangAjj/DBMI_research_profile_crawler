Researcher: Kiran Thakur
Research Overview:
Kiran Thakur's research primarily focuses on the complex interrelationships between various central nervous system (CNS) infections, immune responses, and neurological conditions, particularly in the context of viral diseases such as HIV and COVID-19. His studies encompass a wide array of topics including chemokines involved in immune cell migration, the impacts of multiple sclerosis treatments like natalizumab, and the diagnosis of neuroinfectious diseases through advanced technologies like single-cell RNA sequencing and high-throughput sequencing. Thakur's work addresses critical issues related to CNS infections such as encephalitis, meningitis, and the role of specific pathogens like enteroviruses and arboviruses, demonstrating a keen interest in the emerging challenges posed by pandemics, especially with the recent COVID-19 crisis. Through systematic reviews and meta-analyses, he contributes to knowledge on neurological manifestations and treatment strategies, highlighting healthcare disparities and emphasizing the need for improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in resource-limited settings. Overall, Thakur's research significantly advances understanding of neuroinfectious diseases, their management, and the development of innovative diagnostic tools.
