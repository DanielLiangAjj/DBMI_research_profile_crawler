Researcher: Claudia Lugo-Candelas
Research Overview:
Claudia Lugo-Candelas's research primarily focuses on understanding the complex interplay of ethnicity, gender, and psychosocial factors affecting health disparities and child development, particularly in the context of Puerto Rican communities. Her work investigates the influence of prenatal health, sleep patterns, and dietary factors, such as omega-3 fatty acids, on maternal and child outcomes, highlighting issues of health inequity and psychosocial stressors, including racism and adverse childhood experiences. Lugo-Candelas explores the intergenerational transmission of behaviors and emotional regulation, emphasizing the impact of maternal mental health on offspring neurodevelopment, with specific attention to conditions such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Through her studies, including neuroimaging research, she aims to elucidate the connections between prenatal interventions, psychological stress, and cognitive outcomes in children. Overall, her scholarship contributes valuable insights into the determinants of mental health disparities and the need for culturally tailored maternal and child health strategies.
