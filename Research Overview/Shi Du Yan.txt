Researcher: Shi Du Yan
Research Overview:
Shi Du Yan's research primarily focuses on exploring the clinical applications and pharmacological effects of Yiyi Fuzi Baijiang Powder, particularly its role in addressing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The work emphasizes the impact of key molecular players, including cyclophilin D (CypD), amyloid Î² peptides, and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), on mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Through various advanced methodologies including X-ray crystallography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the research seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms of these proteins and their interactions with small molecules and neuroprotective agents. It explores the relationship between oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurodegenerative processes, aiming to identify therapeutic strategies that leverage these insights to improve cognitive function and mitigate diseases linked to aging and metabolic dysregulation. Overall, the body of work contributes significantly to the fields of traditional herbal medicine and modern pharmacotherapy in the context of complex neurobiological disorders.
