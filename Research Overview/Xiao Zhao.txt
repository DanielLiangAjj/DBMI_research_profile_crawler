Researcher: Xiao Zhao
Research Overview:
Xiao Zhao's research encompasses a diverse range of topics, primarily focusing on the intersections of cancer treatment, nanotechnology, and biomedicine. Significant efforts are directed towards exploring therapeutic strategies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, including the efficacy of anlotinib and the role of immunotherapy. Zhao's work also delves into the mechanisms of various cancers such as breast, liver, and prostate cancers, applying advanced methodologies like single-cell analysis and spatial distribution techniques to better understand tumor microenvironments and associated macrophage behavior. Additionally, the researcher investigates the development of innovative nanocarriers and drug delivery systems, particularly utilizing nanoparticles, hydrogels, and engineered exosomes for targeted cancer therapy. Alongside cancer research, Zhao also examines environmental factors affecting biodegradation and soil pollutants, as well as the biochemical pathways in plant studies, highlighting the importance of cross-disciplinary approaches in tackling complex scientific questions. This extensive body of work not only contributes to therapeutic advances in oncology but also emphasizes the significance of personalized medicine and ecological considerations in modern research landscapes.
