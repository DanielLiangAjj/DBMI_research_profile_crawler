Researcher: Andrew Tomlinson
Research Overview:
Andrew Tomlinson's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily centered around exercise physiology, respiratory mechanics, and biomedical applications. His investigations delve into the factors contributing to dyspnea (shortness of breath), particularly in populations suffering from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), obesity, and other age-related conditions. He examines the mechanics of breathing, gas exchange inefficiencies during exercise, and the physiological consequences of elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. In addition to human studies, his work includes comparative studies in veterinary medicine, focusing on conditions like cervical spondylomyelopathy in dogs and the surgical interventions employed, such as vertebral distraction-fusion and custom implants. Moreover, Tomlinson's research extends to molecular and genetic studies in model organisms like Drosophila, where he explores cell differentiation and gene regulation in relation to photoreceptor development. Overall, his work integrates clinical and experimental approaches to better understand respiratory function across different species and conditions, marrying physiology with therapeutic strategies.
