Researcher: Eric Schon
Research Overview:
Eric Schon's research primarily focuses on the intersections of cellular biology, specifically the relationships between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, the role of lipids in neurodegenerative diseases, and mitochondrial dynamics. His work delves into the implications of cholesterol and lipid metabolism in conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, exploring how mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAM) facilitate vital cellular functions and contribute to disease pathogenesis. Through structural biology techniques, Schon investigates the impact of amyloid precursor proteins and their metabolite C99 on mitochondrial function, as well as mitochondrial DNA mutations and their association with neurodegenerative disorders. His research also encompasses models of mitochondrial diseases, utilizing human iPSC and genetic therapies to address mitochondrial dysfunction and improve understanding of mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. Overall, Schon's work sheds light on the critical roles that lipid interactions, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and cellular stress responses play in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to inform therapeutic strategies for these conditions.
