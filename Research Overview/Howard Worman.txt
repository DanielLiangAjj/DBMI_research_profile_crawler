Researcher: Howard Worman
Research Overview:
Howard Worman's research primarily focuses on the molecular mechanisms underpinning various cardiomyopathies and nuclear envelope disorders, particularly relating to lamin proteins. His work investigates the roles of lamins in cellular processes such as metabolism, aging, and liver disease, using advanced animal models and techniques like next-generation sequencing. Worman has actively explored the implications of mutations in lamin genes in conditions such as Hutchinsonâ€“Gilford progeria syndrome and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. His studies also examine the involvement of nuclear envelope dynamics in cardiac function and response to stressors, including COVID-19. Through the evaluation of signaling pathways, lipid metabolism, and the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope, Worman's research contributes to understanding the pathophysiological links between aging, metabolic disorders, and heart disease, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for treatment.
