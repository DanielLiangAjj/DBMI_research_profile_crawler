Researcher: Edward Connolly
Research Overview:
Edward Connolly's research encompasses a broad range of topics primarily focused on neurocritical care, stroke management, and forensic DNA analysis. His work investigates the implications of activated partial thromboplastin time and anti-factor Xa levels in the treatment of conditions like intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage. He also explores novel interventions in neuroprotection and functional independence following ischemic stroke, emphasizing hospital management and associated costs. In the field of forensic science, he examines DNA persistence, recovery, and transfer, contributing to advancements in criminalistics, particularly through the use of machine learning and algorithms. His research is complemented by an interest in cardiovascular conditions, such as atherosclerosis and carotid stenosis, where he studies treatment outcomes and complications of surgical interventions like carotid endarterectomy. Connolly integrates cutting-edge technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and 3D printing, to enhance research methodologies and outcomes. In summary, his diverse investigations aim to improve clinical practices in neurocritical care and forensic DNA analysis, focusing on patient outcomes, hospital resource utilization, and advancements in scientific techniques.
