Researcher: Steven Kushner
Research Overview:
Dr. Steven Kushner's research predominantly focuses on neurodevelopmental disorders, mental health, and the underlying genetic, cellular, and molecular mechanisms contributing to these conditions. His extensive work encompasses the roles of astrocytes, neurons, and extracellular vesicles in neural function and pathology, particularly in disorders such as Rett syndrome, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. He employs advanced methodologies including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), CRISPR gene editing, and neuroimaging techniques to explore the interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental factors, as well as the impact of neuroinflammation and viral infections like SARS-CoV-2 on mental health outcomes. Additionally, his research delves into psychosocial stressors and their effects on child and adolescent psychiatry, assessing risk factors for self-injurious behavior and psychotic disorders, while seeking integrative approaches, including complementary medicine, for prevention and therapeutic intervention. Overall, Dr. Kushner's scholarship strives to enhance understanding of the biological and psychosocial underpinnings of mental illness, ultimately contributing to improved risk prediction, resilience, and treatment strategies in clinical settings.
