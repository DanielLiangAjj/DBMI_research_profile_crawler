Researcher: David Fidock
Research Overview:
David Fidock's research focuses on the molecular biology and pharmacology of malaria, particularly the mechanisms of drug resistance in the Plasmodium species, including P. falciparum, P. berghei, and P. vivax. His work encompasses the investigation of antimalarial drug combinations, emphasizing artemisinin-based therapies and their resistance mechanisms, particularly through proteomics, genomics, and genetic manipulation techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9. Fidock's studies explore various molecular targets and pathways, including lipid metabolism, drug transporters like PfCRT, and interactions involving serine hydrolases and proteasome activity. Furthermore, he employs bioinformatics and structure-based drug design to identify potential new antimalarials. His comprehensive research not only aims to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of drug resistance but also contributes to developing innovative strategies for malaria drug discovery in the context of global health and infectious disease control.
