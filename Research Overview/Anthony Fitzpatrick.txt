Researcher: Anthony Fitzpatrick
Research Overview:
Anthony Fitzpatrick's research primarily revolves around advanced imaging techniques and molecular biology, focusing on cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). His work delves into the structural dynamics of proteins, particularly in relation to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, corticobasal degeneration, and Pick's disease. Utilizing innovative approaches like laser phase plate and ultrafast electron microscopy, Fitzpatrick investigates critical processes such as endocytosis, protein aggregation, and post-translational modifications, including tau protein dynamics related to tauopathies. Additionally, his research incorporates the interplay between biological molecules such as low-density lipoproteins and their receptors, linking them to the development of biomarkers for neurodegeneration. Through the integration of techniques like 4D electron diffraction and visual proteomics, Fitzpatrick's work aims to uncover the mechanisms behind protein misfolding and aggregation, contributing valuable insights into potential therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative disorders.
