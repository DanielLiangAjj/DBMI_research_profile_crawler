Researcher: Sho Iketani
Research Overview:
Sho Iketani's research primarily focuses on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, emphasizing its variants, antibody responses, and antiviral strategies. The studies delve into various aspects of the virus, including antibody evasion mechanisms, the efficacy of mRNA vaccines, the role of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, and the implications of viral mutations on drug resistance and immune responses. Key findings highlight the convergent evolution of variants such as Omicron with subvariants like BA.2.75 and BQ.1, revealing insights into receptor-binding affinity and the stability of the spike protein. Additionally, Iketani explores the interaction between immune cells, including B and T cells, with viral proteins and antibodies, using advanced techniques like deep mutational scanning and bio-layer interferometry. Overall, the body of work contributes significantly to understanding viral evolution, vaccine development, and therapeutic interventions against COVID-19 and its variants, illustrating the ongoing challenges posed by emerging viral strains and the need for continuous adaptation in treatment strategies.
