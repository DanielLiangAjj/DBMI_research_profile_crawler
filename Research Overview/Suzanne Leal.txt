Researcher: Suzanne Leal
Research Overview:
Suzanne Leal's research encompasses a wide array of genetics-related fields, primarily focusing on neurodevelopmental disorders, hearing impairment, and cardiovascular diseases. Leveraging advanced genomic techniques such as exome sequencing and optical genome mapping, her studies investigate the role of copy number variants and structural variants in various congenital and developmental conditions like intellectual disabilities, polymicrogyria, and Deafness. Her collaborative work includes analyzing large datasets from the United Kingdom Biobank and utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to understand complex traits and genetic predispositions linked to diseases, including asthma, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions like Marfan syndrome and thoracic aortic diseases. Lealâ€™s research also delves into the genetic mechanisms underlying rare disorders in diverse populations, particularly in Africa and the Philippines, revealing insights into inheritance patterns and the implications of genetic variation on health. Overall, her contributions significantly advance the understanding of genetic epidemiology, elucidate the complexities of human genetics, and aim to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for neurodevelopmental and hereditary conditions.
