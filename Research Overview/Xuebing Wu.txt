Researcher: Xuebing Wu
Research Overview:
Xuebing Wu's research encompasses a wide array of advanced molecular and genetic techniques, particularly focusing on the CRISPR-Cas systems and their applications in functional genomics and therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative diseases. His work often involves the use of CRISPR-Cas13 and Cas9 technologies for gene editing and RNA targeting, with significant applications in the study of microglial functions, chromatin accessibility, and cellular regeneration processes. Moreover, Wu's studies include the characterization of RNA dynamics through high-throughput analysis and profiling methods like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), thereby elucidating gene expression regulation in various conditions, including chronic renal failure and cancer. His investigations in proteomics and the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between immune cells and tumor microenvironments also highlight the complexity of cellular responses to environmental stressors such as hypoxia and inflammation. Altogether, Wu's research significantly contributes to the understanding and treatment possibilities for complex diseases, revealing intricate relationships between genetics, cellular environments, and disease pathology.
