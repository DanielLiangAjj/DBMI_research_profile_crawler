Researcher: Jonathan A. Javitch
Research Overview:
Jonathan A. Javitch’s research primarily focuses on the mechanisms and effects of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly the μ-opioid receptor and its interactions in the context of drug action, addiction, and analgesia. His extensive work with GPCRs encompasses functional assays, intrinsic efficacy, and the signaling pathways associated with various neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin. A key aspect of his studies involves the pharmacological properties and therapeutic impacts of opioid and cannabinoid receptors, highlighting the challenges associated with opioid analgesics like fentanyl regarding safety and respiratory depression. Beyond pharmacology, his research integrates advanced imaging techniques, including single-molecule imaging and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), to assess receptor dynamics and interactions at the cellular level. Furthermore, he explores the structural biology of these receptors to enhance understanding for drug discovery efforts aimed at developing safer, more effective therapeutic options for conditions like schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases. His comprehensive approach effectively bridges molecular neuroscience with translational applications, contributing significantly to the field's understanding of receptor biology and therapeutic advances.
