Researcher: Tal Korem
Research Overview:
Tal Korem's research primarily explores the intricate relationship between dietary influences, the microbiome, and various health outcomes, including esophageal cancer and metabolic disorders. His work emphasizes the role of the esophageal and salivary microbiomes, employing advanced genomic and metagenomic techniques to investigate their assembly and function. Korem examines how factors such as diet—particularly the effects of bread and glycemic index—interact with the microbiome to influence metabolism, symptom severity in functional bowel disorders, and even the severity of conditions like COVID-19. His research also delves into the connections between microbial diversity, dysbiosis, and various diseases, including obesity and diabetes, utilizing metabolomic approaches to understand host-microbe interactions. Through a combination of machine learning and precision medicine, Korem aims to personalize dietary recommendations, advancing our understanding of chronic disease prevention and management.
