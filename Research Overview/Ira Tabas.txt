Researcher: Ira Tabas
Research Overview:
Ira Tabas's research primarily focuses on the interplay between immune cells, particularly lymphocytes and macrophages, in the context of atherosclerosis, liver diseases, and metabolic disorders. His studies delve into the mechanisms of inflammation resolution, crosstalk between myeloid cells and various signaling pathways, and the role of efferocytosis in tissue homeostasis and repair. A significant portion of his work explores the impact of macrophage activation on chronic inflammatory diseases, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis, alongside the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis, particularly regarding lipid metabolism and the immune response in cardiovascular diseases. Tabas is keenly interested in translational research aimed at developing novel therapeutic approaches, such as GalNAc-siRNA for targeted gene silencing, and investigating biomarkers for disease progression. Overall, his research contributes valuable insights into the intricate connections between immune responses, metabolism, and the progression of chronic diseases, laying the groundwork for potential innovations in treatment strategies for atherosclerosis and liver-related diseases.
