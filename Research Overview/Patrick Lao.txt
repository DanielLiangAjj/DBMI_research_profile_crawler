Researcher: Patrick Lao
Research Overview:
Patrick Lao's research primarily focuses on the intersection of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS), with particular attention to the mechanisms of neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, and aging. His studies extensively utilize advanced neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess biomarkers of AD, including amyloid-beta and tau proteins, and their relationship to white matter hyperintensities and cerebrovascular disease. He investigates the impact of various factors including pulse pressure, ethnicity, and family history on AD progression and cognitive function. Additionally, his work explores the roles of neuroinflammation and small vessel disease in the aging brain, aiming to delineate the complexities of dementia and memory disorders in both typical aging and populations with DS. Through clinical trials and longitudinal studies, Lao's findings contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms and potential interventions for improving cognitive health across diverse demographic groups.
