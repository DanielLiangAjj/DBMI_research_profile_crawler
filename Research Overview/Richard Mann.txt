Researcher: Richard Mann
Research Overview:
Richard Mann's research encompasses a diverse array of topics within the realms of biology, neuroscience, and computational modeling, particularly focusing on the interactions between genetic and environmental factors influencing behavior and development. His work employs sophisticated methodologies such as Bayesian inference and machine learning to explore collective animal behavior, cognition, and decision-making processes, linking them to genetic underpinnings and evolutionary contexts. Significant emphasis is placed on Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism, which he utilizes to investigate the functional impacts of genetic variation, including missense mutations and gene regulatory dynamics. Additionally, his studies encompass neurodevelopment, motor control, and the implications of neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating a commitment to understanding the intricate relationships between genetics, behavior, and environmental influences. The integration of these elements not only sheds light on fundamental biological processes but also has broader applications, including insights into health economics and social behavior. Overall, Mann's research provides a comprehensive view of the interplay between genetics and behavior, contributing to our understanding of both individual and collective traits in biological systems.
