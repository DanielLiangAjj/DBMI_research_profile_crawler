Researcher: Gunnar Hargus
Research Overview:
Gunnar Hargus's research primarily focuses on neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Utilizing innovative techniques such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), Hargus develops disease models that deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these disorders. His work explores the roles of key biomarkers, such as tau proteins and osteopontin, in neuroinflammation and degeneration, while investigating the processes involved in neuronal development, microglial activation, and tau phosphorylation. Hargus also addresses the epidemiological impacts of conditions like COVID-19 on neurological health, probing into neuroinflammatory responses and their implications for disease progression. Through his research, he aims to uncover novel therapeutic targets and advance the field of neurology, with a specific emphasis on cell-based regenerative strategies and the interaction of various cell types in brain pathology.
