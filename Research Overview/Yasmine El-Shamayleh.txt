Researcher: Yasmine El-Shamayleh
Research Overview:
Yasmine El-Shamayleh's research predominantly explores the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual decision making and object recognition in nonhuman primates, specifically the rhesus macaque (*Macaca mulatta*). Utilizing advanced methodologies such as optogenetics and chemogenetics, her work investigates the roles of various brain regions—including the parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and visual areas like V4—in processing motion and visual information. Her studies employ tools like muscimol to inactivate specific neural pathways, and the application of adeno-associated viral vectors to manipulate neuronal activity. Through these approaches, El-Shamayleh examines how feedback signals and neural plasticity influence perceptual choices, saccade behavior, and visual encoding, providing insights into the cognitive functions associated with motion perception and visual recognition. Overall, her research significantly contributes to our understanding of the neural dynamics involved in decision making and the integration of sensory information in primate vision and cognitive processing.
