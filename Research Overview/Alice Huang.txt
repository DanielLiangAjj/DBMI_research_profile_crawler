Researcher: Alice Huang
Research Overview:
Alice Huang's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on the intricate interplay between tendon biology, regenerative medicine, and advanced imaging techniques. Central to her work is the exploration of electrospun fiber-reinforced hydrogel composites aimed at enhancing tendon progenitor cell function and facilitating tenogenesis in various tendons, including the anterior cruciate ligament and rotator cuff. Her investigations into tendinopathy and tendon injuries highlight the significance of biological augmentation and functional healing processes, alongside the roles of molecular markers like HER2 and advancements in imaging modalities such as PET/CT and SPECT/CT in oncology, particularly for breast cancer. Furthermore, Huang integrates artificial intelligence and deep learning methodologies to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes in both tendon repair and cancer therapy, including CAR T cell therapy. Her multidisciplinary approach combines insights from immunology, tissue engineering, and biomechanics, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of tendon regeneration, wound healing, and the management of adverse events in immunotherapy, positioning her as a pivotal figure in the convergence of orthopaedic and oncology research.
