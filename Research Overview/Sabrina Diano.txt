Researcher: Sabrina Diano
Research Overview:
Sabrina Diano's research focuses on the intricate relationship between metabolic disorders, particularly diabetes and obesity, and central nervous system functions, particularly within the hypothalamus. She explores the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance, glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial dynamics, emphasizing the roles of key regulators such as PGC-1Î± and uncoupling proteins. Her work addresses the interactions between neuroinflammatory responses, feeding behavior, and the regulation of energy homeostasis, while also investigating the influence of neuropeptides like pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) in these processes. Diano's findings contribute significant insights into how glial cells, microglia, and neurons interact to affect metabolic outcomes, highlighting the neural circuits that govern appetite and energy expenditure in the context of diet-induced obesity and related complications. Overall, her research advances our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of metabolic diseases and proposes potential avenues for therapeutic interventions focused on brain metabolism and endocrine regulation.
