Researcher: Jeffrey Liebmann
Research Overview:
Jeffrey Liebmann's research primarily focuses on glaucoma, particularly primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and explores the underlying epidemiological, genetic, and health disparity factors associated with this condition. His work integrates advanced imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), and machine learning methodologies to enhance the detection, monitoring, and understanding of glaucoma progression and treatment outcomes. His studies have emphasized the importance of racial differences, specifically in populations of African descent, and have highlighted the significance of community-based eye health screenings and public health initiatives to improve healthcare access for underserved communities. Furthermore, Liebmann's research delves into the neurodegenerative aspects of glaucoma, including the role of retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell health, while advocating for the use of telemedicine to reach vulnerable populations. Overall, his work supports the integration of technology and community-based approaches to advance glaucoma care and research while addressing significant health disparities.
