Researcher: Guillermo Horga
Research Overview:
Guillermo Horga's research encompasses a diverse range of topics centered around neuroscience, neuroimaging, and psychiatric disorders, with a strong emphasis on psychosis, particularly schizophrenia and its related conditions. Utilizing advanced techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), Horga investigates the neural correlates of decision-making, dopamine signaling, and reward processing in healthy and clinical populations. His work highlights the role of neuromelanin in neurodegenerative processes and its implications for cognitive dysfunction across various mental health disorders, including treatment-resistant schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and substance use disorders. Additionally, he explores the interactions of cognitive mechanisms such as perceptual inference and hierarchical processing, showcasing how these relate to psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. By integrating computational modeling and neuroimaging approaches, Horga aims to identify biomarkers for predicting treatment responses and advancing precision medicine in psychiatry, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of serious mental illnesses.
