Researcher: Yonghao Yu
Research Overview:
Yonghao Yu's research encompasses a diverse range of topics, predominantly focused on the interplay between cancer biology, anesthetic effects, and inflammatory responses in various biological systems. Key areas of investigation include the mechanisms underlying pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), utilizing advanced methodologies like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to identify potential diagnostic and prognostic markers, particularly in the context of tumor progression and epithelial marker expression. The studies further delve into the role of molecular hydrogen and its impact on oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuroprotection, especially in sepsis-associated encephalopathy and acute lung injury models. Yu’s investigations also highlight the influence of surgical anesthesia protocols—including agents like propofol and remifentanil—on postoperative outcomes and cognitive functions, underscoring the significance of drug interactions and neuroinflammatory pathways in pain management and recovery. Additionally, the researcher probes into cellular responses to oxidative stress, epigenetic modifications, and the development of therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders linked to conditions like diabetes and obesity. Collectively, Yu’s work aims to elucidate complex biological processes and establish integrated approaches to enhance patient care in surgical and oncological settings.
