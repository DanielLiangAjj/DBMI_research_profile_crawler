Researcher: Yalda Moayedi-Esfahani
Research Overview:
Yalda Moayedi-Esfahani's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily related to neurobiology and sensory innervation within the context of vocal fold paralysis and related neuroinflammatory conditions. Key themes include the study of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, mechanisms of laryngeal muscle innervation, and the implications of injury to this nerve, leading to vocal fold paralysis. The research utilizes advanced methodologies like calcium imaging and automated tracking to explore the roles of Merkel cells, PIEZO2 channels, and various transcription factors (such as Hoxb1, Hoxb2, and Phox2b) in mechanosensation and neuronal functionality. Additionally, Moayedi-Esfahani investigates the interactions of neuropeptides, inflammatory responses, and physiological changes in both animal models and human applications. The findings contribute significantly to understanding peripheral nervous system functions, mechanotransduction, and the intricate dynamics of oral and laryngeal structures in health and disease, paving the way for potential therapeutic strategies for conditions like dysphagia and chronic vocal fold pathologies.
