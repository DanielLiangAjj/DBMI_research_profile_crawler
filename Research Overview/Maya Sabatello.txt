Researcher: Maya Sabatello
Research Overview:
Maya Sabatello's research focuses on the intersection of genetics, health equity, and personalized medicine, particularly addressing the barriers faced by marginalized populations in accessing genomic technologies and understanding their implications. Her work examines critical themes such as the impact of polygenic risk scores (PRS) on individuals with chronic diseases, the ethical considerations surrounding the return of genetic results, and the necessity for improved genomic literacy and health education within diverse communities. Sabatello advocates for equity in healthcare, emphasizing the need to counteract structural injustices and the medical Matthew effect, which leads to disproportionate resources and better outcomes for certain demographics over others. Through community engagement and participatory design approaches, she aims to foster trust and inclusivity in precision medicine research, particularly for communities at the intersection of disability, race, and socio-economic status. Her contributions also delve into the ethical dilemmas posed by genetic testing and emphasize the importance of informed consent and privacy protections, paving the way for more equitable healthcare policies and practices that are responsive to the needs of vulnerable populations.
