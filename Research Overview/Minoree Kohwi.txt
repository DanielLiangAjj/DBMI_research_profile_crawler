Researcher: Minoree Kohwi
Research Overview:
Minoree Kohwi's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of cell fate determination and competence within the context of neural development, particularly utilizing *Drosophila* as a model organism. The central themes of her work revolve around the roles of various transcription factors such as Corto and Hunchback, as well as the influence of the nuclear architecture, including the nuclear lamina and Polycomb group proteins, on neuroblast identity and differentiation. Through her studies, Kohwi investigates how the temporal identity of neural progenitors is regulated, providing insights into the developmental gene expression pathways that govern the competence of stem cells and their subsequent fate in the formation of the central nervous system. Her findings contribute significantly to our understanding of developmental biology and neural stem cell dynamics, shedding light on the genetic and epigenetic factors that dictate cell differentiation in the nervous system.
