Researcher: Ikjae Lee
Research Overview:
Ikjae Lee's research primarily focuses on neurodegenerative diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and myasthenia gravis (MG), exploring their pathways, clinical management, and treatment implications. Key areas of investigation include the metabolism of bile acids like TUDCA and their potential neuroprotective effects in ALS, the use of machine learning algorithms to improve diagnostic and treatment approaches, and the impact of disease severity on quality of life and daily living activities for patients. Additionally, Lee's work encompasses natural history studies, patient registries, and clinical trials aimed at understanding disease progression and outcomes in both ALS and MG. The intersection of these studies is particularly critical in understanding the broader implications of health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic on these patient populations, alongside their psychosocial implications, as evidenced by anxiety and health-related quality of life assessments. Overall, Lee's research contributes valuable insights into the management, treatment, and prognostic understanding of motor neuron diseases and their associated disorders.
