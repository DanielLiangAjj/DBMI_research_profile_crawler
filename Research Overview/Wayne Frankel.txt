Researcher: Wayne Frankel
Research Overview:
Wayne Frankel's research focuses on the mechanisms underlying various forms of epilepsy and associated neurodevelopmental disorders using molecular neuroscience techniques. His work emphasizes the role of potassium and sodium channels, particularly the KCNT1 channel and its gain-of-function variants, affecting GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission in neuronal networks. His studies involve advanced electrophysiological methods, such as calcium imaging and electrocorticography, to investigate cortical hyperexcitability and spike-wave discharges characterizing absence seizures. Additionally, Frankel employs animal models and gene therapy approaches to explore potential therapeutic interventions for conditions like developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and infantile spasms. His contributions to understanding the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms of these disorders are significant, particularly in relation to concepts such as neuroprotection, excitatory-inhibitory balance, and the role of the mTOR pathway in epileptogenesis, paving the way for progress in epilepsy research and potential preventative strategies. Overall, Frankel's work integrates molecular biology, genetics, and neuroscience to elucidate the complexities of epilepsy and its treatment.
