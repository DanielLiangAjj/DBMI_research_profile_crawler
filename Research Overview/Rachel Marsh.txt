Researcher: Rachel Marsh
Research Overview:
Rachel Marsh's research encompasses a broad spectrum of psychological and neurobiological topics, with a particular focus on childhood and adolescent mental health disorders, including Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), eating disorders (particularly bulimia nervosa), anxiety disorders, and their interrelations with socioeconomic factors, maternal influences, and neurodevelopmental aspects. Utilizing advanced neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and fMRI, her studies investigate the underlying brain structures and functions associated with cognitive control, error processing, and emotional regulation, particularly in youth populations facing various adversities. Marshâ€™s work also delves into the relationships between neuroimaging findings and psychological outcomes, examining comorbidity in mental health conditions and the impacts of treatments like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Furthermore, her research addresses neurodevelopment during critical stages, including prenatal influences and childhood adversity, offering insights into how these factors contribute to long-term psychological health. Overall, Marsh's contributions illuminate the complexities of mental health in children and adolescents, emphasizing the importance of understanding both biological and psychosocial dimensions of these disorders.
