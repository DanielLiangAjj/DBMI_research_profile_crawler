Researcher: Rebecca Haeusler
Research Overview:
Rebecca Haeusler's research focuses on the intricate dynamics of metabolic diseases, particularly how bile acids, their metabolism, and specific regulatory mechanisms influence conditions like obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her work investigates the roles of molecules such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), various angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4), and significant metabolic regulators including insulin and glucose levels related to liver conditions like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis. Haeusler's studies also delve into the beneficial impacts of bariatric surgery on metabolic health, highlighting its effect on lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, she explores the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and macrophages in these metabolic dysfunctions. Through her work, Haeusler aims to elucidate the connections between bile acid signaling, hepatic metabolism, and their implications for diabetes treatment and management, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying metabolic syndromes and potential therapeutic interventions.
