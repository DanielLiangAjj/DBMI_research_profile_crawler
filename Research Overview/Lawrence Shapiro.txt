Researcher: Lawrence Shapiro
Research Overview:
Lawrence Shapiro's research primarily focuses on the development and understanding of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against various viral pathogens, particularly HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. His work extensively utilizes advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), molecular dynamics simulations, and binding affinity predictions to explore the structural biology of viral proteins, including the spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses and hemagglutinin of influenza viruses. Shapiro is heavily invested in the design of immunogens and vaccines, aiming to elicit robust neutralizing antibody responses and elucidating the mechanisms of antibody maturation and somatic hypermutation. His studies further delve into protein-protein interactions and the optimization of antibody binding interfaces, enhancing our understanding of immune responses to viral infections. Through in silico mutational screening and high-throughput sequencing, he investigates the dynamics of antibody evolution and the challenges posed by viral escape mechanisms, contributing significantly to vaccine design, immunology, and therapeutic strategies for combating infectious diseases. Overall, Shapiro's work represents a critical intersection of immunology, virology, and structural biology aimed at advancing global health outcomes.
