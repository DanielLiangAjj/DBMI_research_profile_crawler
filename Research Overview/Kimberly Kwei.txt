Researcher: Kimberly Kwei
Research Overview:
Kimberly Kwei's research primarily centers on the intersection of genetic and neurological disorders, with a strong focus on multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease, and various forms of ataxia. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), and colocalization techniques, her work aims to unravel the genetic underpinnings of these conditions. Additionally, she employs pathway analysis and gene-burden analysis to explore how specific genetic features contribute to the manifestation of neurological disorders. Kwei also investigates the impact of mind-body practices, including yoga and meditation, on managing symptoms associated with these diseases, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her comprehensive approach combines the genetic, physiological, and psychological dimensions of health, ultimately aiming to enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by movement disorders through innovative therapeutic strategies.
