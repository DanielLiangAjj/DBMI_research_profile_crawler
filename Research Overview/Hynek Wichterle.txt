Researcher: Hynek Wichterle
Research Overview:
Hynek Wichterle's research focuses on the intricate regulatory mechanisms guiding the fate specification, differentiation, and maturation of neuronal and pancreatic islet cells, particularly motor neurons and Î² cells. His work prominently features transcription factors such as NKX2.2, Isl1, and Lhx3, which are crucial for neuronal development and cellular diversity. Through the use of pluripotent stem cells and advanced techniques like CRISPR genome engineering and epigenome editing, Wichterle explores the role of chromatin structure, enhancer regulation, and DNA methylation in gene expression and development. Additionally, his studies encompass the implications of neuroinflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and cellular stress mechanisms, particularly in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative disorders. By integrating molecular biology, genomics, and regenerative medicine, his research aims to unveil novel therapeutic strategies to combat neuronal degeneration and enhance regenerative capacity within the spinal cord and pancreas. Overall, Wichterle's work significantly contributes to the understanding of gene regulatory networks and their roles in neural cell fate and function, with broader implications for neurodegenerative disease treatment and stem cell therapies.
