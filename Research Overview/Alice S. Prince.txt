Researcher: Alice S. Prince
Research Overview:
Alice S. Prince's research focuses primarily on the pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms of various bacterial pathogens, particularly **Klebsiella pneumoniae** and **Staphylococcus aureus**, as well as the immune response to these infections. Key aspects of her work include investigating the emergence of **carbapenem** and **colistin resistance** through mechanisms like **mcr-1** and exploring the role of host immune factors such as **neutrophils** and **oxidative burst** in combating bacterial infections. Her studies also delve into the interplay between metabolic adaptations of pathogens, including the roles of **itaconate** and **succinate**, and the influence of bacterial resistance on **pulmonary infections**. By employing various **animal models** and examining **host-pathogen interactions**, Prince aims to elucidate the **immunometabolic** shifts that accompany infections by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Overall, her research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying **bacterial persistence**, **host susceptibility**, and the challenges posed by **antimicrobial resistance** in respiratory infections, with potential implications for enhancing therapeutic strategies against pneumonia and other bacterial diseases.
