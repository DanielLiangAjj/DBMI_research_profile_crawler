Researcher: Alberto Ciccia
Research Overview:
Alberto Ciccia's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of DNA damage response and repair, particularly as they relate to genomic stability, cancer biology, and the application of CRISPR technologies in gene editing. His studies delve into key proteins such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are crucial for maintenance of genomic integrity, particularly in the context of break-induced replication and homologous recombination. Additionally, Ciccia's investigations into replication stress and stalled replication forks highlight the vulnerabilities leading to oncogene activation and cancer progression, with implications for therapies such as PARP inhibitors and cancer immunotherapy. The research employs advanced techniques, including CRISPR-Cas9 screens and high-throughput genomic analysis, to explore pathways of DNA repair and cellular reprogramming, providing insights into epigenetic regulation and chromatin dynamics. Overall, Ciccia's work contributes significantly to our understanding of genetic disorders, tumor biology, and novel therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.
