Researcher: Ian Lipkin
Research Overview:
Ian Lipkin's research primarily focuses on the interplay between infectious diseases, the microbiome, and chronic conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). His work employs advanced sequencing technologies like high-throughput sequencing and hybrid capture methods (e.g., VirCapSeq and BacCapSeq) to enhance pathogen discovery and diagnostic capabilities in clinical microbiology. Key areas of investigation include neuroinfectious diseases, the effects of viral infections like COVID-19 on long-term health (including Long COVID), and metabolic implications associated with persistent fatigue. Furthermore, Lipkin studies the gastrointestinal microbiome's role in various conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and autism spectrum disorders. His research integrates a wide spectrum of methodologies, from metabolomics and proteomics to transcriptomics and multi-omics approaches, contributing to a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions, disease progression, and the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. Overall, Lipkin's contributions significantly advance our knowledge of viral epidemiology, emerging infectious diseases, and the biological underpinnings of chronic fatigue syndromes and other related health conditions.
