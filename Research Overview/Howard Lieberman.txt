Researcher: Howard Lieberman
Research Overview:
Howard Lieberman's research focuses on several crucial areas within trauma care, cancer biology, and genetic repair mechanisms. His work includes significant contributions to understanding trauma management, particularly with the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) and its implications for quality improvement in trauma and critical care environments. Liebermanâ€™s investigations extend to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute kidney injury (AKI), and the factors affecting postoperative complications such as infections and readmissions. The research also delves into the molecular underpinnings of prostate cancer, emphasizing the roles of various oncogenes and tumor suppressors, particularly the RAD9 gene and its connections to DNA damage and repair processes. Through a combination of clinical studies and molecular biology, Lieberman's work aims to enhance treatment outcomes while addressing the complexities of postoperative care and cancer prognosis, thus contributing to better quality of life for patients facing these critical health challenges.
