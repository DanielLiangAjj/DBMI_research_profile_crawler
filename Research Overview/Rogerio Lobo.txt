Researcher: Rogerio Lobo
Research Overview:
Rogerio Lobo's research primarily focuses on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its associated metabolic, hormonal, and reproductive implications. His work delves into the various phenotypes of PCOS, examining factors such as insulin resistance, hormonal therapies, and the interplay between androgens and estrogens. He has explored the genetic underpinnings of PCOS, including chromosomal abnormalities and gene editing technologies like CRISPR, and their impacts on embryonic development and fertility diagnostics. Additionally, Lobo investigates the metabolic syndrome, obesity, central adiposity, and their cardiovascular complications in the context of women's health, particularly during menopause. He emphasizes the significance of accurate ovarian reserve testing and fertility treatments, contributing to the development of clinical guidelines for managing conditions like hirsutism and hyperandrogenism. His broader research also encompasses cognition, quality of life in menopausal women, and the effects of hormone replacement therapies. Overall, Lobo's multidisciplinary approach enhances the understanding of reproductive endocrinology and its implications for women's overall health.
