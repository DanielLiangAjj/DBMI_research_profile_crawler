Researcher: Catherine Spina
Research Overview:
Catherine Spina's research predominantly explores the immune response and therapeutic interventions in various cancers, particularly focusing on the roles of CD4-positive T-lymphocytes and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and bladder cancer. Significant attention is given to immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, and advanced strategies such as intravesical radionuclide therapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy. Additionally, her work evaluates the implications of aging and hormonal influences on sarcopenia and kidney development, linking aspects of autoimmunity and treatment outcomes in prostate cancer and Wilms tumor. Spina's research incorporates innovative techniques such as dosimetry and single-cell analysis, emphasizing the need for personalized approaches in oncology. Overall, her contributions facilitate a deeper understanding of tumor microenvironments and immune interactions, paving the way for enhanced therapeutic strategies in cancer care.
