Researcher: Andrew Einstein
Research Overview:
Andrew Einstein's research primarily focuses on advancing cardiovascular imaging and diagnostics through innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, mixed reality, and augmented reality. His work spans multiple aspects of cardiovascular diseases, including but not limited to coronary artery disease, heart failure, and valvular heart diseases like mitral valve insufficiency. He emphasizes the use of advanced imaging techniques like myocardial perfusion imaging, computed tomography angiography, and echocardiography, alongside machine learning applications for enhanced diagnostic accuracy and risk prediction. Einstein's investigations also address health equity, particularly in the context of COVID-19 and its impact on cardiac health, as well as the challenges of managing diagnostic disparities. His commitment to implementing innovative research and technology in clinical practices aims to improve patient care, optimize diagnostic procedures, and ultimately contribute to better cardiovascular health outcomes across diverse populations.
