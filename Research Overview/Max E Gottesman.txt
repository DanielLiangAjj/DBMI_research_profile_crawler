Researcher: Max E Gottesman
Research Overview:
Max E Gottesmanâ€™s research encompasses a variety of topics, primarily focusing on the molecular mechanisms of transcription, DNA repair, and the dynamics of RNA polymerase. His inquiries delve into processes such as liquid-liquid phase separation and its role in transcription elongation and termination, highlighting the significance of transcription-translation coupling within bacterial models, particularly E. coli. His work also addresses the functioning and regulation of transcription factors, including the NusG and Nus factors involved in transcription antitermination. Additionally, Gottesman investigates the molecular underpinnings of genomic instability, specifically through processes like double-strand break repair and recombination, alongside the implications of these mechanisms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated anosmia. A strong emphasis on biochemical techniques, including single-molecule tracking, cryo-electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations, reflects his dedication to understanding both the structural and functional dimensions of biomolecular interactions. Collectively, Gottesman's studies contribute invaluable insights into the intricate relationship between transcription dynamics, DNA repair mechanisms, and the implications for cellular integrity and replication fidelity.
