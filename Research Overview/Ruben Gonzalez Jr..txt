Researcher: Ruben Gonzalez Jr.
Research Overview:
Ruben Gonzalez Jr. is a researcher whose work intersects biochemistry and biophysics, focusing primarily on the mechanisms of translation and translational regulation in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. His investigations into the dynamics and interactions of ribosomes, initiation factors, and mRNA recruitment highlight the intricacies of translation initiation processes. Utilizing advanced techniques such as single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), mass photometry, and cryo-electron microscopy, he has elucidated the structural conformations and kinetics involved in protein biosynthesis. His research integrates mathematical frameworks like Bayesian inference and hidden Markov models to analyze complex datasets, contributing to a deeper understanding of gene expression regulation under various cellular conditions, including stress and dormancy. Additionally, his exploration of artificial enzymes and biofunctionalization expands the application of his findings within biotechnology. Overall, Gonzalez's work significantly advances our knowledge of translational mechanics and their implications for cellular functionality and regulation.
