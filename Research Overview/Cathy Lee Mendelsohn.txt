Researcher: Cathy Lee Mendelsohn
Research Overview:
Cathy Lee Mendelsohnâ€™s research focuses on the complex interplay between embryonic development, carcinogenesis, and the mucosal microenvironment, particularly in urinary tract and bladder cancers. Her work delves into mechanisms of field carcinogenesis and the effects of epigenetic regulation, encompassing studies on forerunner genes and histone modifications. Using various animal models, including transgenic and knockout mice, Mendelsohn explores the molecular pathways influencing urothelial differentiation and regeneration, linking genetic predispositions and environmental factors, such as bacterial dysbiosis and urinary tract infections, to cancer pathogenesis. Key topics include the roles of specific oncogenes, DNA methylation patterns, and the regulation of stem cell behavior in the urothelium. Her research also extends to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, connecting developmental kidney disease with genetic engineering approaches, and provides insights into potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for bladder neoplasms. Overall, her extensive work contributes significantly to understanding bladder cancer biology, the mechanisms of immune evasion in tumors, and the implications of epigenetics in oncogenesis and tissue repair.
