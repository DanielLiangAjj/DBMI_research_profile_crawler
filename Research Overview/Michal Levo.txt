Researcher: Michal Levo
Research Overview:
Michal Levo's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of gene expression regulation, particularly in model organisms such as Drosophila and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Utilizing advanced techniques including high-throughput sequencing, quantitative analysis, and single-cell measurements, his work explores the roles of transcription factors, enhancers, and promoter regions in developmental gene regulation. Through the construction of gene expression atlases and fluorescence-based methodologies, he investigates chromatin dynamics, DNA binding interactions, and the thermodynamics of protein-DNA complexes. Levo's contributions extend to computational biology, enriching our understanding of gene regulatory networks and the genetic underpinnings of transcriptional activation. His findings have significant implications for developmental biology and genetic engineering, offering insights into the fundamental processes that govern gene expression across different organisms.
