Researcher: Danish Saleheen
Research Overview:
Danish Saleheen's research primarily focuses on the genetic underpinnings of cardiovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, through the lens of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). His work centers on lipid biology, genetics, and precision medicine, where he employs sophisticated methodologies such as fine-mapping, functional genomics, and metabolic profiling to identify genetic variants linked to dyslipidemia and related disorders. He has investigated the influence of specific genes, including nitric oxide synthase type III and various apolipoproteins, on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk, particularly in diverse populations such as South Asians. By utilizing approaches like Mendelian randomization and Gaussian graphical modeling, Saleheen aims to elucidate causal relationships between genetic factors and disease phenotypes, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies and improved risk assessment methodologies in the context of development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. His research contributes significantly to understanding the complex genetic architecture of multifactorial traits, linking genetic predisposition to modifiable risk factors like obesity and diabetes mellitus, thereby advancing the field of cardiovascular genetics and public health.
