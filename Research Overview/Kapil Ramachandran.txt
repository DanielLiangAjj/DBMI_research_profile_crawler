Researcher: Kapil Ramachandran
Research Overview:
Kapil Ramachandran's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily centered around neuronal activity, proteasome function, and developmental biology, particularly in the context of congenital heart defects and hypertrophy. Utilizing techniques like BONCAT for identifying activity-induced nascent proteins in neurons, his work indicates a crucial interplay between neuronal activity and cellular processes such as proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins and ribosomal functions. The studies involve various model organisms, including mammalian systems and zebrafish, to explore the molecular and genetic underpinnings of neural plasticity and cardiovascular anomalies, including hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Through his examination of immediate early genes and calcium signaling pathways, Ramachandran aims to elucidate the mechanisms of signaling transduction in both neural and cardiac tissues. Overall, his contributions significantly advance the understanding of how developmental and neural processes interact, with implications for addressing congenital defects and enhancing neuronal function.
