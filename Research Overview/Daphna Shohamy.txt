Researcher: Daphna Shohamy
Research Overview:
Daphna Shohamy's research extensively investigates the interplay between cognitive processes, reinforcement learning, and neurobiological underpinnings, particularly focusing on conditions such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease and anorexia nervosa. Her work examines how brain regions like the striatum, hippocampus, and orbitofrontal cortex contribute to decision-making, reward processing, and memory. Through the application of advanced methodologies, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modeling, she explores topics like episodic memory, uncertainty, and reward generalization. Shohamy's studies provide insights into the cognitive and neurological mechanisms of learning and memory, particularly in the context of individual differences and aging, while also addressing the complexities of eating behaviors and mental health disorders. Ultimately, her research aims to enhance understanding of how these mechanisms can be disrupted in various psychiatric conditions, thereby contributing to the development of more effective treatment strategies.
