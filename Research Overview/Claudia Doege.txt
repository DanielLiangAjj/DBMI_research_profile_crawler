Researcher: Claudia Doege
Research Overview:
Claudia Doege's research primarily focuses on the intersection of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease, along with obesity and its associated metabolic pathways. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), and organoid modeling, her work delves into the molecular genetics underlying these conditions, emphasizing the role of key proteins like Tau and Osteopontin (OPN) in neuroinflammation and neuronal differentiation. Additionally, her studies investigate the genetic predisposition to obesity and related disorders, employing techniques from bioinformatics and functional genomics to explore gene regulatory networks and polymorphisms linked to body mass index. By integrating systems biology with cellular reprogramming approaches, her research aims to develop novel therapeutic strategies, including cell therapy and transplantation, to address neurological and metabolic diseases, ultimately providing insights into disease mechanisms that could inform future clinical applications.
