Researcher: Elana Bernstein
Research Overview:
Elana Bernstein's research primarily focuses on systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and its associated complications, particularly related to interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary hypertension. Through cross-sectional and cohort studies, she investigates the epidemiology, risk factors, and health outcomes of systemic sclerosis and its impact on lung and heart function. Her work emphasizes the role of immune components, such as monocytes, and biomarkers in understanding the progression of autoimmune diseases. Bernstein also explores therapeutic interventions, including the use of tocilizumab and other immunosuppressive agents, to manage symptoms and improve quality of life for patients suffering from these conditions. Key research themes involve evaluating lung function through pulmonary function testing and imaging modalities, assessing patient-reported outcomes, and analyzing healthcare resource utilization. Overall, her contributions enhance the understanding of systemic sclerosis, inform clinical practices, and guide future therapeutic strategies in managing related diseases.
