Research Overview:
J Sevelius's research focuses on the intersection of health equity and HIV prevention and treatment, particularly among transgender and gender-diverse populations. Through clinical trials and qualitative research, they explore the unique challenges faced by transgender individuals, including barriers to accessing healthcare, medication adherence, and the impact of stigma and discrimination. Their studies emphasize the importance of gender affirmation, the role of peer support and navigation services, and the need for inclusive health communication strategies. J Sevelius also addresses broader health disparities, emphasizing the importance of culturally relevant interventions tailored for marginalized communities, such as transgender women of color and those involved in sex work. Overall, their work aims to enhance healthcare access, improve health outcomes, and combat the systemic inequities that hinder effective HIV care and prevention efforts for transgender persons.
