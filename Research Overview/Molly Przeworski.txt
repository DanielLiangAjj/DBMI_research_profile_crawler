Researcher: Molly Przeworski
Research Overview:
Molly Przeworski's research encompasses a wide range of topics primarily centered around evolutionary biology, genetics, and genomics, with a particular emphasis on DNA damage and repair, germline mutations, and their evolutionary implications. Her work investigates mechanisms such as double-strand break (DSB) repair and gene conversion, particularly in the context of meiotic recombination and hotspot dynamics in both humans and mice. She explores the role of natural selection on mutation rates and patterns across species, examining factors such as the paternal and maternal age effects, sex differences in mutation spectrum, and genomic features like CpG transition rates and genetic fitness. Przeworski also utilizes comparative genomics and phylogenetic methods to shed light on the evolutionary trajectories of PRDM9, a key gene associated with recombination and hotspot formation. Furthermore, her research contributes to understanding complex human genetic diseases, including the implications of loss-of-function mutations and recessive lethals, integrating demographic influences and genetic variance within populations. Through her investigations, she aims to elucidate the interplay between genetic mechanisms and evolutionary processes, ultimately enhancing the understanding of human and vertebrate evolution.
