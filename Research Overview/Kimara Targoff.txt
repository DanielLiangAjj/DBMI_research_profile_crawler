Researcher: Kimara Targoff
Research Overview:
Kimara Targoff's research primarily focuses on cardiovascular development, particularly the mechanisms underlying heart formation and identity in zebrafish models. Her studies explore the role of critical transcription factors such as nkx2.5 and nkx2.7 in the development of heart structures, including the atrium and ventricle. Notably, her work delves into the complex interactions of various signaling pathways and genetic factors that contribute to chamber identity and heart rate variability. By investigating the second heart field and the arterial and venous poles, Targoff aims to understand congenital heart defects and cellular proliferation processes. Furthermore, her research emphasizes the developmental regulation of gene expression and the impact of neural crest-derived cells on cardiac morphology. Overall, her findings contribute to the broader understanding of heart development and the potential implications for addressing congenital heart disorders.
