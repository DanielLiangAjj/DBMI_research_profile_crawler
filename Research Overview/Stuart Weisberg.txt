Researcher: Stuart Weisberg
Research Overview:
Stuart Weisberg's research spans a diverse array of topics primarily focused on immune responses related to autoimmunity, cancer immunotherapy, diabetes, and viral infections like COVID-19. His work emphasizes the roles of adaptive immunity, T regulatory cells, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment, particularly in the context of melanoma and pancreatic cancer. Weisberg explores biomarkers associated with these immunological responses alongside the effects of aging and the interactions of various immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells. His studies also delve into complications arising from viral infections and their impact on lung immunity, particularly concerning SARS-CoV-2. By utilizing techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing, he aims to elucidate the mechanisms of immune regulation and dysfunction across multiple pathologies, thereby contributing valuable insights to the fields of immunotherapy and disease management.
