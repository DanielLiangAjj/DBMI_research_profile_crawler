Researcher: Monica Goldklang
Research Overview:
Monica Goldklang's research focuses on the multifaceted aspects of lung injury, inflammation, and immune response, particularly within the context of diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute lung injury. Her work incorporates various experimental models, including mice and rabbits, to explore the interplay between molecular pathways like the Wnt pathway, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and damage-associated molecular patterns in relation to lung health. Goldklang's investigations extend into the impact of environmental factors such as cigarette smoke and SARS-CoV-2 on lung pathology, emphasizing the role of neutrophils, macrophages, and mediators like matrix metalloproteinases and vascular endothelial growth factor. Additionally, her work on innovative imaging techniques for assessing lung morphology and functionality, alongside the evaluation of treatment strategies and the immune response against viral infections, positions her contributions as significant within pulmonary research. Overall, her research aims to enhance the understanding of lung disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches.
