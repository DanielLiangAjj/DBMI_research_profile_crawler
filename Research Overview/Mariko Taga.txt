Researcher: Mariko Taga
Research Overview:
Mariko Taga's research focuses primarily on the molecular underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease and associated cognitive disorders. With a particular emphasis on key genetic factors such as APOE, CLU, SMAD, and SORL1, Taga investigates their roles in processes like amyloid-beta accumulation, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation mediated by microglia and astrocytes. Her work extends to evaluating the impact of endolysosomal pathways and retromer functionality on neuronal health, as well as exploring the involvement of inflammatory markers and metabolic processes linked to neurodegeneration. The studies also highlight the significance of biomarkers, genetic variations, and environmental influences in Alzheimer's pathology, alongside addressing practical aspects like lumbar puncture complications in clinical settings. Overall, Taga's comprehensive approach combines genetic, biochemical, and clinical perspectives to advance the understanding and potential treatment avenues for Alzheimer's disease, targeting both neuronal resilience and inflammatory response mechanisms.
