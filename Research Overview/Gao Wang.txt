Researcher: Gao Wang
Research Overview:
Gao Wang's research focuses primarily on the genetic underpinnings of complex human diseases through advanced bioinformatics methodologies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). His work encompasses an array of health conditions, including asthma, type 2 diabetes, age-related hearing loss, essential tremor, and Alzheimer's disease, leveraging data from large-scale cohorts such as the United Kingdom Biobank. Wang employs various analytical techniques, including fine-mapping, mediation analysis, and spectral analysis of sequencing and exome data, to identify disease-associated variants and their potential regulatory effects. His studies also investigate the role of genetic and molecular traits, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variants, and gene expression regulation, in the phenotypic variability of these conditions. Overall, his contributions significantly enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets.
