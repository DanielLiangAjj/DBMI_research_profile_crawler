Researcher: Stephen Goff
Research Overview:
Stephen Goff's research focuses on the intricate interplay between histone modifications, transcriptional regulation, and retroviral interactions, particularly with HIV-1. His studies explore the mechanisms of transcriptional silencing, the behavior of unintegrated retroviral DNAs, and the roles of various histones and histone variants in chromatin dynamics. Goff has also contributed to understanding host-pathogen interactions, particularly concerning innate immunity and antiviral defenses against HIV-1 and coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2. His work encompasses diverse topics, including drug resistance in viral infections and the molecular basis of zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19. Additionally, Goff investigates the implications of gene regulation through post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation and ubiquitination, which play crucial roles in various biological processes including cancer biology and stem cell differentiation. Through a multidisciplinary approach, integrating virology, molecular biology, and epigenetics, Goff's research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms governing viral pathogenesis and host defense, and potentially informs the development of targeted antiviral therapies and vaccines.
