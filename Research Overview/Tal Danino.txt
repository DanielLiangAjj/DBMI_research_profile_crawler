Researcher: Tal Danino
Research Overview:
Tal Danino's research focuses on the intersection of microbiology and cancer therapy, exploring innovative approaches that leverage bacteria and probiotics in the treatment of various cancers, particularly breast and colorectal neoplasms. His work extensively investigates the tumor microenvironment and the mechanisms of immune response modulation through strategies such as checkpoint inhibitors and immunotherapy. By employing synthetic biology and genetic engineering, Danino aims to develop targeted biotherapeutics, including engineered probiotics that can deliver therapeutic agents like GM-CSF, butyrate, and other metabolites directly to tumors, potentially overcoming treatment-resistant cancer phenotypes. Additionally, his studies utilize advanced techniques such as high-throughput screening, single-cell analysis, and biosensing technologies to better understand the interaction between engineered bacteria and host immune cells. Through these multidisciplinary efforts, Tal Danino's research contributes significantly to the development of novel cancer treatments that harness the therapeutic potential of the gut microbiome and living biotherapeutics, paving the way for innovative cancer management strategies.
