Researcher: Annie Lee
Research Overview:
Annie Lee's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationships between mitochondrial dynamics, neurodegenerative diseases, and the impact of various psychosocial and vascular risk factors. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics, her work investigates the roles of specific genes (like ZCCHC17) and mitochondrial processes in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and heart disease. Additionally, her studies extend to the mechanisms of neurovascular interactions and the effects of COVID-19, particularly concerning the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its implications for vaccine efficacy against various variants. By integrating knowledge across genomics and disease modeling using human, mouse, and zebrafish models, Lee aims to enhance the understanding of disease etiology, identify potential biomarkers, and refine genetic testing for at-risk populations. Ultimately, her findings contribute to the growing knowledge of how genetic predispositions, mitochondrial health, and external factors may converge to influence the onset and progression of neurodegenerative conditions.
