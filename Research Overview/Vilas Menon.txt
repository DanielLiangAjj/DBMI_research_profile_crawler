Researcher: Vilas Menon
Research Overview:
Vilas Menon's research primarily focuses on Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, utilizing advanced methodologies such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), and lipidomics to explore the genetic, cellular, and molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions. His investigations encompass a wide range of topics, including the role of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in lipid metabolism and neuroinflammation, the genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and the implications of microglial activation in various forms of dementia, including frontotemporal dementia and multiple system atrophy. Furthermore, Menon's work involves disease modeling using iPSCs to analyze phenotypic variations and the effects of genetic mutations associated with neurodegenerative diseases. By integrating approaches from transcriptomics, proteomics, and computational biology, his research aims to elucidate complex neurobiological pathways, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of neurodegeneration and potential therapeutic targets.
