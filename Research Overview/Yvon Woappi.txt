Researcher: Yvon Woappi
Research Overview:
Yvon Woappi's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on cellular behaviors, particularly in the context of epidermal stem cells and human keratinocytes within innovative 3-D culture systems. His work investigates the mechanisms of anoikis and cell transformation, emphasizing the roles of integrins and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in signaling pathways. Through the development of cell-based models and spheroids, Woappi explores the influence of commensal bacteria and foodborne pathogens on immunity and inflammatory diseases, integrating concepts of carcinogenesis and antibiotic resistance. Additionally, his research delves into nanomedicine and drug-delivery systems, examining therapeutic strategies through cellular models for virally-induced conditions, particularly related to Human Papillomavirus type 16. His multifaceted approach combines systems biology and genetic engineering techniques to address issues of drug resistance and microbial pathogens, contributing valuable insights to the understanding of skin neoplasms and the intersection of microbiology and oncology. Ultimately, Woappi's work lays the foundation for potential therapeutic advancements and novel strategies in managing skin-related diseases and microbial infections through engineered cellular models and nanotechnology.
