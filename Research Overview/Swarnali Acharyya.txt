Researcher: Swarnali Acharyya
Research Overview:
Swarnali Acharyya's research primarily focuses on the complex interplay between cancer, particularly breast and lung cancers, and cachexia, a multifaceted syndrome characterized by muscle wasting and weight loss. Her studies explore the implications of BRCA mutations, KRAS mutations, and the role of specific zinc transporters (such as Slc39a14 and ZIP14) in cancer progression and cachexia. Utilizing various mouse models, Acharyya investigates the mechanisms underlying metastasis and muscle atrophy, examining the influence of factors like NF-ÎºB signaling, cytokines, and tumor microenvironment on disease outcomes. Additionally, her work delves into the effects of chemotherapy and novel therapeutics on muscle preservation and overall quality of life for cancer patients, contributing to a deeper understanding of the biological and molecular bases of cachexia associated with advanced malignancies like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer. Through her research, Acharyya aims to elucidate the pathways that lead to cachexia, ultimately seeking to inform better treatment strategies and improve the prognosis for patients with metastatic cancers.
