Researcher: Uttiya Basu
Research Overview:
Uttiya Basu's research primarily focuses on the mechanisms underlying B cell immunology, specifically the processes of somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, which are critical for antibody diversity and specificity. A significant emphasis is placed on the role of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in these processes, including its association with genomic integrity and epigenetic regulation. His work also explores the implications of aberrant somatic hypermutation in the context of Non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma, shedding light on potential therapeutic strategies. Additionally, Basu investigates the complexities of RNA processing and degradation, particularly the involvement of the RNA exosome complex and non-coding RNAs in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular health. His research integrates molecular biology, immunology, and genetics, contributing to a deeper understanding of immune regulation, cancer biology, and cellular differentiation in both stem and B cells. Overall, his findings advance the knowledge of immune system dynamics and present new avenues for treatment in related diseases.
