Researcher: Gene Yocum
Research Overview:
Gene Yocum's research primarily focuses on the role of GABAA receptors and their involvement in asthma pathophysiology, particularly concerning airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. Utilizing a range of experimental models such as precision-cut lung slices, FlexiVent systems, and organ bath techniques, Yocum investigates the effects of various agents— including benzodiazepines and house dust mite antigens—on airway smooth muscle function and cytokine release. The research delves into mechanisms of calcium signaling, macrophage and eosinophil activity, and the regulatory role of T-cells within the asthmatic response, measured using laboratory models, including mice and guinea pigs. Significant attention is given to the modulation of GABAA receptor subtypes and associated pharmacology, contributing to the understanding of alternative therapeutic strategies for asthma management. Overall, Yocum's work elucidates the intricate interplay of molecular pathways in asthma, highlighting potential avenues for effective treatment approaches.
