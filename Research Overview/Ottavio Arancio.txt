Researcher: Ottavio Arancio
Research Overview:
Ottavio Arancio's research predominantly focuses on understanding the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative conditions. His work explores the interplay between various factors such as autophagy, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive functions, particularly within the hippocampus. A significant emphasis is placed on the role of amyloid-beta peptides, tau protein, and the effects of neuroinflammation on cognitive impairment and dementia. His studies utilize advanced techniques such as fluorescence imaging, drug repurposing, and mouse models to investigate therapeutic strategies, including the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and other pharmacological agents. Additionally, his research encompasses the implications of genetic alterations, such as mutations in the presenilin genes, and the impact of stress and environmental factors on neuronal homeostasis and memory. Overall, Arancio's work significantly contributes to the understanding of the molecular pathways involved in Alzheimer's disease, aiming to identify potential targets for intervention and treatment strategies to alleviate cognitive decline.
