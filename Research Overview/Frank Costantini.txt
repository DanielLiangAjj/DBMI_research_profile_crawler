Researcher: Frank Costantini
Research Overview:
Frank Costantini's research focuses on elucidating the complex processes involved in kidney development and the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease. His work incorporates various methodologies including organ culture and the use of organoids, alongside advanced genetic manipulation techniques such as conditional knockouts utilizing Cre and FLP recombinases. A significant aspect of his research investigates the roles of receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly FGF receptors, in branching morphogenesis and nephron formation within the embryonic kidney. Moreover, he employs in-depth analyses on signaling pathways involving transcription factors and proto-oncogenes, which are critical for cell proliferation, differentiation, and overall renal organogenesis. His studies utilizing genetic models like chimeras and knockout mice further detail the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie congenital abnormalities in the urinary tract, such as congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). Overall, Costantini's research aims to bridge developmental biology and clinical nephrology, contributing valuable insights into renal health and disease.
