Researcher: Filippo Mancia
Research Overview:
Filippo Mancia's research encompasses a diverse array of topics within the fields of molecular biology, structural biology, and infectious diseases, with a particular focus on drug resistance mechanisms in pathogens and the molecular dynamics of membrane proteins. His studies often involve the exploration of Plasmodium falciparum and its adaptations to antimalarial treatments, notably examining the role of PfCRT in drug resistance evolution. Mancia employs advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography to elucidate the structures and functions of integral membrane proteins and glycosyltransferases relevant to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Additionally, he investigates Wnt signaling pathways and their implications in cellular behavior and disease progression. His research also intersects with the development of biosensors and point-of-care diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 variants, making significant contributions to understanding infectious diseases and drug resistance. Overall, Mancia's work illuminates critical biological transport mechanisms and their implications for developing therapeutic strategies against complex pathogens.
