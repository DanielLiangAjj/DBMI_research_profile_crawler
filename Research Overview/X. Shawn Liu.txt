Researcher: X. Shawn Liu
Research Overview:
X. Shawn Liu's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of gene regulation and the pathophysiology of neurological and cancer-related disorders, primarily through the lens of chromatin dynamics and epigenetic modifications. His work highlights key genes such as MECP2 and FMR1, linking their dysfunction to conditions like Rett syndrome and Fragile X syndrome, respectively. Utilizing advanced techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing and targeting DNA methylation, Liu explores potential therapeutic avenues for these brain disorders. Additionally, his investigations into pancreatic cancer emphasize the role of non-coding RNAs and miRNAs in tumor biology, aiming to identify prognostic biomarkers and enhance treatment modalities. Through methods like single-cell sequencing and epigenome editing, Liu contributes to a deeper understanding of cellular phenotypes, the underlying genetic mutations, and their impact on disease progression, ultimately bridging insights from molecular genetics to clinical applications in neurology and oncology.
