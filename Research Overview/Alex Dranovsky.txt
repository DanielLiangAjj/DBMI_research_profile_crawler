Researcher: Alex Dranovsky
Research Overview:
Alex Dranovsky's research primarily focuses on the interplay between neurogenesis, cognitive decline, and the aging process, utilizing model organisms to uncover mechanisms underlying learning and memory. His investigations reveal the crucial role of the hippocampus and its structural changes in response to early-life stress and aging, particularly in the context of anxiety and depression. Dranovsky's studies often employ advanced imaging techniques, such as resting-state fMRI and structural MRI, to explore brain activity and connectivity associated with memory disorders. His work also delves into the therapeutic potential of agents like fluoxetine and vilazodone in promoting neuroplasticity and alleviating cognitive impairments. Additionally, he examines the influence of critical developmental periods on resilience to stress and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, highlighting the importance of serotonergic signaling pathways, specifically the 5-HT(1A) receptor. Dranovsky's comprehensive approach not only contributes to our understanding of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and depression but also emphasizes the significance of neurodevelopmental processes throughout the lifespan.
