Researcher: René Hen
Research Overview:
René Hen’s research primarily focuses on the intricate interplay between neurogenesis, particularly in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and various factors related to mood disorders, including depression and anxiety. His work extensively studies the mechanisms of pattern separation and contextual encoding, both critical for memory and learning processes. Hen employs advanced methodologies such as in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics to investigate the role of adult neurogenesis in stress resilience and behavioral responses to antidepressants like fluoxetine. His research also delves into the neurobiological underpinnings of reward processing, examining how early-life stress affects reward learning and behavior. A notable aspect of his work is the exploration of serotonin receptors, especially the 5-HT1A and 5-HT4 receptors, and their implications in treating major depressive disorders and anxiety. By utilizing various animal models and a bioinformatics approach, Hen aims to uncover the molecular and cellular interactions that contribute to mental health conditions, ultimately contributing to better therapeutic strategies for mood disorders.
