Researcher: René Hen
Research Overview:
René Hen's research primarily focuses on neurogenesis and its implications for mental health, particularly in the context of depression and anxiety. His investigations delve into the role of the dentate gyrus, a critical region of the hippocampus, in processes such as contextual encoding and pattern separation, which are essential for memory and learning. Through advanced techniques like in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, his work explores how neurogenesis is influenced by various factors, including chronic stress, early-life adversity, and treatment with antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and fluoxetine. Hen's studies also examine the molecular underpinnings of these behaviors, investigating the role of serotonin receptors, doublecortin (a neuronal marker for neurogenesis), and the influence of genetic variations on anxiety and depression responses. The implications of his research extend to understanding the greater biological mechanisms that underlie mood disorders and stress resilience, ultimately aiming to inform drug discovery and therapeutic approaches for mental health conditions.
