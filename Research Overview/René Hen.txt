Researcher: René Hen
Research Overview:
René Hen's research focuses on the intricate relationship between neurogenesis, particularly in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and its influences on behavior, stress, and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. His work explores various biological mechanisms, including the roles of serotonin, β-arrestin, and various neurotransmitter systems, particularly in the context of adult neurogenesis. Hen employs advanced methodologies such as in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, animal models, and optogenetic techniques to study the processes of pattern separation and contextual encoding in relation to emotional resilience and stress responses. Additionally, his investigations include the effects of antidepressant treatments, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine, on neurogenesis and behavioral outcomes, providing insights that could inform therapeutic strategies for major depressive disorder and other stress-related conditions. Thus, Hen's body of work significantly contributes to elucidating the neurobiological underpinnings of depression and offers potential pathways for drug discovery and treatment interventions in mood disorders.
