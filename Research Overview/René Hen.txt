Researcher: René Hen
Research Overview:
René Hen's research primarily focuses on understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, through the lens of neurogenesis and neural circuits within the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. His work investigates the mechanisms of adult neurogenesis, contextual encoding, and pattern separation, emphasizing the impact of early-life stress and chronic stress on behavioral outcomes. Utilizing advanced techniques like in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, he explores the role of serotonin receptors, particularly 5-HT1A and 5-HT4, as well as the influence of antidepressants such as fluoxetine and the potential for therapeutic targets like β-arrestin-2. Hen's research also delves into the effects of neurotransmitters, stress resilience, emotional behavior, and the involvement of specific neural circuits in various model organisms, contributing to a deeper understanding of how biological and environmental factors intersect to shape cognitive and emotional processes in mental health. Through systematic reviews and meta-analyses, he aims to synthesize knowledge that offers insights into novel treatment strategies and the biological basis of psychiatric disorders.
