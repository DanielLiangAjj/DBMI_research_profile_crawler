Researcher: Timothy Cragin Wang
Research Overview:
Timothy Cragin Wang's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily focused on gastrointestinal cancers, particularly Barrett's esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and gastric cancer. His work extensively investigates the role of stem cells, regeneration, and the plasticity of intestinal epithelial cells in cancer progression and tissue homeostasis. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as single-cell analysis and regulatory network analysis, Wang explores the molecular pathways and cellular environments that contribute to carcinogenesis, with particular attention to the influence of bile acids, microbiome factors, and inflammatory responses. His studies delve into the roles of critical molecular players such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR), Wnt signaling, and trefoil factors in tissue regeneration and cancer biology. Additionally, his research includes the intersection of cancer and immunology, particularly the roles of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and cytokines. Wangâ€™s innovative approaches, including the use of murine models and patient-derived organoids, aim to enhance understanding of cancer mechanisms and improve therapeutic strategies for gastrointestinal malignancies, ultimately contributing to advancements in personalized medicine and cancer prevention strategies.
