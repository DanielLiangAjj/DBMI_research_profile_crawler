Researcher: Angela Christiano
Research Overview:
Angela Christiano's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationship between autoimmune disorders, particularly alopecia areata, and various cellular and genetic mechanisms underlying skin diseases. Her work explores T cell interactions, the role of cytokines, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and gene editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9, aiming to advance personalized treatments based on genetic predispositions and immune responses. Additionally, she investigates the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and tissue engineering to create novel therapeutic approaches for epidermolysis bullosa and other skin pathologies. By integrating systems biology, artificial intelligence, and comprehensive genomic studies, her research seeks to elucidate the pathogenesis of hair disorders and enhance patient outcomes through innovative therapies that address both the biological and psychosocial aspects of autoimmune conditions.
