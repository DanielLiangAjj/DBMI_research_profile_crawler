Researcher: Ian Kronish
Research Overview:
Ian Kronish's research primarily focuses on addressing the complexities of cardiovascular health, particularly in relation to hypertension, acute coronary syndrome, and their psychological implications on patients. His work emphasizes the importance of medication adherence and patient management strategies in the context of chronic diseases, often exploring the impact of psychological distress, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, on treatment outcomes. He employs various methodologies, including randomized clinical trials and feasibility studies, to assess interventions such as mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral therapies that aim to improve patient self-management and compliance. Additionally, Kronish investigates healthcare disparities influenced by social determinants of health and the effectiveness of telemedicine in improving follow-up care and patient education, thereby striving to enhance overall health-related quality of life for survivors of cardiac events. His comprehensive approach combines behavioral science with clinical practices, underscoring the critical interplay between physical health, mental well-being, and adherence to treatment protocols in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
