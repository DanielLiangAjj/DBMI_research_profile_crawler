Researcher: Emanuele Barca
Research Overview:
Emanuele Barca's research spans a wide range of scientific inquiries, primarily focusing on the intersection of mitochondrial diseases, environmental biology, and agricultural practices. His work investigates the implications of heavy metal contamination and micropollutants in agronomic settings, particularly concerning sludge quality and the plastic recycling processes. He has examined the role of oxidative stress as a contributing factor in mitochondrial diseases, and how metabolic reprogramming and immune responses—particularly those involving cytokines and macrophages—affect muscle and neuromuscular disorders. Additionally, Barca's research includes the ecological aspects of the Mediterranean region, emphasizing biodiversity, organismal responses to chemical herbicides, and the health of freshwater systems. By integrating clinical genetics with environmental science, Barca provides insights into both the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction and the environmental consequences of agricultural practices, thereby contributing to a multidisciplinary understanding of health and sustainability.
