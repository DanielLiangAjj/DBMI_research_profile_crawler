Researcher: Miguel Arce Rentería
Research Overview:
Miguel Arce Rentería's research predominantly revolves around cognitive function and its impairment across diverse populations, with a strong emphasis on cross-cultural and cross-national comparisons. His work investigates the influences of sociocultural factors, health beliefs, and disparities in health equity particularly among minority groups, including Hispanic/Latino and African American communities. Key themes in his research include the impact of cognitive aging, the role of neuropsychological assessments, and the genetic and lifestyle factors associated with dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and cognitive reserve. He explores how racial and ethnic disparities manifest in cognitive impairment, mental health outcomes, and the effects of structural determinants of health, such as socioeconomic status and perceived discrimination. By integrating findings from longitudinal studies, neuroimaging, and genetic analysis, Arce Rentería contributes significant insights into the complexities of cognition and aging, underlining the necessity of tailored interventions that address the unique experiences and risks faced by these populations. His work ultimately aims to enhance understanding of cognitive health and implement strategies that promote equity in mental health care.
