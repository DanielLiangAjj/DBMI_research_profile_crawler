Researcher: Giuseppe Tosto
Research Overview:
Giuseppe Tosto's research centers around the genetic underpinnings and epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders. His studies leverage advanced techniques such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, and transcriptome-wide association studies to identify genetic risk factors and biomarkers linked to AD across diverse populations, including African American and Caribbean-Hispanic cohorts. Tosto investigates the effects of specific genes, such as CNNM2 and APP, on brain morphology, vascular health, and cognitive performance, utilizing animal models like zebrafish and transgenic mice alongside human subjects. His work also scrutinizes the influence of APOE alleles, DNA methylation, and rare variants in the disease's progression and phenotypic expression, emphasizing the importance of ancestry and admixture in genetic predisposition. By integrating findings from neuroimaging, neuropsychological assessments, and genetic epidemiology, Tosto aims to enhance our understanding of neurogenesis, cerebrovascular interactions, and the complex genetic landscape of AD, ultimately contributing to prospective interventions and health care policies for aging populations.
