Researcher: Brett Youngerman
Research Overview:
Brett Youngerman's research encompasses a comprehensive exploration of various facets of neurosurgery, particularly focusing on epilepsy and its surgical interventions. His work covers a range of innovative technologies and methodologies, including the application of CMOS technology in implantable devices and the utilization of laser interstitial thermal therapy for treating conditions such as drug-resistant epilepsy and temporal lobe epilepsy. Youngerman's studies extensively analyze surgical techniques like stereotactic electroencephalography and the endoscopic endonasal approach, addressing outcomes in procedures for brain tumors, meningiomas, and epilepsy surgery. He also emphasizes the importance of quality improvement in healthcare, investigating patient safety, cost-effectiveness, and the impact of electronic health records on treatment decisions. Through his research, Youngerman aims to enhance patient outcomes in neurosurgery while refining practice patterns and exploring the intricate relationship between neurosurgical procedures and functional recovery, especially in patients with complex conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder and epilepsy. His work stands as a significant contribution to the evolving landscape of functional neurosurgery and the broader field of oncology, addressing both clinical practice and innovative research methodologies.
