Researcher: Sarah O'Shea
Research Overview:
Sarah O'Shea's research focuses on the complex interplay between COVID-19 and various movement disorders, including long-lasting effects such as myoclonus ataxia, parkinsonism, and other neurological challenges. Her work encompasses a range of themes, including the genetic underpinnings of these diseases, differential diagnosis techniques, and the efficacy of neurostimulation therapies like deep brain stimulation. The research employs advanced methodologies such as network analysis and FDG PET imaging to explore neuropathological changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 and their implications for conditions like essential tremor, chorea, and developmental delays. With an emphasis on both human and animal studies, O'Shea aims to unravel the risk factors and outcomes associated with these disorders, contributing valuable insights to the fields of neurology and neurodevelopmental disorders, while also addressing clinical decision-making and the need for precise diagnostic approaches. Ultimately, her work is poised to enhance our understanding of the long-term neurological consequences of COVID-19 and to inform the management strategies for affected individuals.
