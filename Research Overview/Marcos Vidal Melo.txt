Researcher: Marcos Vidal Melo
Research Overview:
Marcos Vidal Melo's research predominantly focuses on the intricate relationships between mechanical ventilation techniques, lung protective strategies, and postoperative respiratory complications, particularly within the contexts of thoracic and other surgical procedures. Key themes in his work include the impact of driving pressure, PEEP titration, and tidal volume adjustments on lung injury prevention and postoperative outcomes, with an emphasis on optimizing intraoperative mechanical ventilation. His investigations utilize advanced imaging modalities such as computed tomography and positron emission tomography to explore lung aeration and perfusion dynamics while integrating machine learning approaches for preoperative prediction of complications like ARDS and postoperative respiratory failure. Furthermore, his research considers the implications of health economics and practice patterns in perioperative medicine, alongside factors such as inflammation, hypoxia, and neuromuscular blockade agents like neostigmine and sugammadex. Overall, Melo's contributions significantly advance the understanding of ventilatory management in surgical settings, aiming to enhance patient outcomes while minimizing postoperative pulmonary complications.
