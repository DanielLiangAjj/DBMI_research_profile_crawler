Researcher: James McKiernan
Research Overview:
James McKiernan's research primarily focuses on the management, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary bladder and kidney neoplasms. His studies address various therapeutic modalities, including cystectomy, intravesical therapies, and immunotherapy, often examining their efficacy in relation to neoplasm recurrence, treatment outcomes, and patient survival rates. He has contributed significantly to understanding the role of biomarkers and tumor microenvironments in urologic cancers, focusing on transitional cell carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, McKiernan explores the complexities of treatment decision-making, such as the use of active surveillance versus surgery, particularly in elderly populations, and the implications of COVID-19 on patient management and quality of care in urological practice. His work in clinical trial design and precision medicine aims to tailor therapies to individual patients' needs, with a clear emphasis on improving survivorship and quality of life in patients facing these malignancies. Overall, his research underscores a commitment to advancing treatment protocols and enhancing patient outcomes in urologic oncology.
