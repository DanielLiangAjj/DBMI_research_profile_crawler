Researcher: Raul Rabadan
Research Overview:
Raul Rabadan's research significantly contributes to the fields of cancer genomics, computational biology, and machine learning, focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying various cancers, including glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, and leukemia. His work encompasses a diverse array of topics, such as the analysis of somatic variants, tumor microenvironment interactions, immune evasion strategies, and the impacts of inflammation and apoptosis on cancer progression. Utilizing advanced methodologies, Rabadan emphasizes dimensionality reduction, cell-type deconvolution, and data imputation techniques in single-cell and spatial omics studies. Additionally, he explores the roles of specific proteins and pathways, including NF-kappaB signaling, the JAK/STAT pathway, and the implications of cell metabolism and lipid dynamics in cancer biology. His research also examines the intersection of viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, with cancer, reflecting an interdisciplinary approach that integrates genomic, immunological, and epidemiological perspectives. Through his findings, he aims to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets that could pave the way for precision medicine and personalized cancer treatment.
