Researcher: Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic
Research Overview:
Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic's research encompasses a diverse array of topics centered around tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and the application of stem cell technologies, particularly related to cardiac and pulmonary health. Her work focuses on the engineering of bioartificial tissues and organs using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells, emphasizing the importance of the microenvironment and biomaterials in facilitating cell differentiation and tissue functionality. She explores concepts such as cardiac tissue engineering, organ-on-a-chip models, and the use of machine learning to optimize drug development and disease modeling. Her studies extend to understanding myocardial inflammation, the regeneration of cardiac tissues following injury, as well as the body's immunological responses in the context of autoimmune diseases. Additionally, Vunjak-Novakovic's research employs innovative bioreactor systems to develop model systems for testing therapeutics and developing personalized medicine approaches, aiming to bridge basic science with clinical applications to enhance organ preservation and transplantation outcomes.
