Researcher: Oliver Clarke
Research Overview:
Oliver Clarkeâ€™s research primarily focuses on the molecular dynamics and structural biology of ion channels, with a particular emphasis on hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN channels) and their interactions with various proteins and ligands. His work investigates key mechanisms such as protein trafficking, enzyme activation, and the role of post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bonds and palmitoleation, in channel function and regulation. He employs advanced techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy and mass photometry, to elucidate the structure-function relationship of these membrane proteins in various biological scenarios, such as calcium signaling and muscle contraction. Additionally, Clarke's research extends into the implications of aberrant protein folding and trafficking in conditions like hypothyroidism and autoimmune disorders, utilizing both experimental models and computational simulations to explore evolutionary perspectives in protein structure and function. Overall, his contributions significantly deepen the understanding of membrane protein dynamics, their physiological roles, and potential therapeutic targets related to ion channelopathies and hormone signaling pathways.
