Researcher: Aaron D Viny
Research Overview:
Aaron D. Viny's research focuses on the complex interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors underlying myeloid malignancies and B-cell disorders, particularly the role of chromosomal architecture and the cohesin complex in hematopoietic stem cell function and the development of hematologic neoplasms. His work extensively investigates germline predisposition factors, mutations affecting crucial genes such as TET2 and STAG1/STAG2, and their implications in diseases like Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Furthermore, the research delves into chromatin dynamics, immune tolerance mechanisms, and the implications of epigenetic modifications on gene expression and clonal evolution using advanced methodologies like Hi-C and CRISPR-Cas systems. Viny's studies also address epidemiological disparities in pediatric and adolescent populations affected by these malignancies, contributing valuable insights into their survival outcomes and the significance of precision medicine approaches in treating hematologic cancers. Overall, his contributions enhance the understanding of the molecular underpinnings of myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, aiming to improve diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies.
