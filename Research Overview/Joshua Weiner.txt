Researcher: Joshua Weiner
Research Overview:
Joshua Weiner's research encompasses a range of topics within the fields of transplantation immunology and cellular biology, with a critical focus on human intestinal transplantation, T cell biology, and xenotransplantation. His work investigates the dynamic reconstitution of the T cell receptor repertoire, particularly in the context of intestinal transplant recipients suffering from conditions like Crohn's disease and Clostridioides difficile infections. Weiner's studies utilize advanced methodologies such as TCRÎ² sequencing and ELISA to evaluate immune responses and the development of tissue resident memory T cells (TRM), which play a pivotal role in mucosal immunity. He also explores the implications of immunosuppression and immune tolerance in transplant recipients, delving into the mechanisms of graft-versus-host disease and methods to enhance graft survival. Furthermore, his contributions extend to the realms of gene editing and cardiac xenotransplantation, showcasing a commitment to advancing clinical practices through translational research. Overall, Weiner's work seeks to improve outcomes for transplant patients by enhancing our understanding of immune regulation and transplant biology.
