Researcher: Christopher Haggerty
Research Overview:
Christopher Haggerty's research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in cardiovascular health, particularly in analyzing electrocardiograms (ECG) and echocardiograms. His studies emphasize the development of deep learning models for risk prediction and diagnosis across various cardiomyopathies, including dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Haggerty's work also explores the genetic underpinnings of cardiovascular diseases through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and the integration of electronic health records (EHR) for improving predictive genetic testing and stratified risk assessments. A significant part of his research is dedicated to enhancing the explainability and interpretability of AI models, ensuring that clinical applications provide meaningful insights for practitioners. Additionally, Haggerty investigates the implications of pediatric obesity and its cardiovascular effects using advanced imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and myocardial strain analysis. Overall, his contributions lie at the intersection of computational biology, clinical cardiology, and genetics, aiming to innovate diagnostic and treatment pathways for cardiovascular conditions.
