Researcher: Xueling Wu
Research Overview:
Xueling Wu's research spans a diverse range of topics, focusing primarily on pulmonary and infectious diseases, as well as environmental biotechnology. Key areas of interest include the effects of direct oral anticoagulants on outcomes related to pulmonary embolism and the role of microbiota in lung conditions such as bronchiectasis exacerbations and interstitial lung disease. Additionally, Wu investigates the interplay between oral and parenteral therapies in diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung adenocarcinoma, including mechanisms of drug resistance. The researcher employs advanced techniques like metagenomic next-generation sequencing to analyze microbial communities in environmental samples and clinical settings, aiming to enhance understanding of both human health and ecosystem functionality. Wu's work also addresses pressing public health issues, including the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the development of effective vaccines, while exploring the potential of bioelectrochemical systems for waste treatment and heavy metal recovery. Overall, Xueling Wu's contributions significantly advance our knowledge of disease mechanisms, therapeutic interventions, and environmental sustainability.
