Researcher: Mikko Turunen
Research Overview:
Mikko Turunen's research spans a diverse array of topics primarily focused on cancer systems biology, advanced therapeutic strategies, and cellular mechanisms underlying diseases such as cancer and stroke. His work emphasizes the role of various genetic and molecular players, including TRPS1, microRNAs, and the VEGF-A pathway, in tumor progression, immune response, and therapeutic resistance, particularly in colorectal and breast cancers. By utilizing advanced techniques such as CRISPR/Cas genetic screening, RNA interference (including shRNA and siRNA), and engineered exosome delivery systems, Turunen investigates the interplay between inflammation, aging, and tumor biology. His research also delves into the molecular intricacies of cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and angiogenesis, often employing animal models and functional genomics to elucidate these mechanisms. Furthermore, his studies explore the potential of gene therapy and novel drug delivery systems to enhance treatment efficacy in various cancers. Overall, Turunen's multi-faceted research approach aims to unravel the complex biological frameworks of cancer and other diseases while paving the way for innovative therapeutic interventions.
