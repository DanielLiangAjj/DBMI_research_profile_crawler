Researcher: Ulrich Hengst
Research Overview:
Ulrich Hengst's research primarily focuses on unraveling cellular and molecular mechanisms related to neurodegeneration, neuronal resilience, and axon development. Central to his work is the role of CREB3L2 and related signaling pathways, such as the hedgehog pathway, which are instrumental in neuronal responses to stress, oxidative stress management, and neurogenesis, particularly in the context of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. His studies explore the dynamics of local protein synthesis and mRNA localization in axons, emphasizing the significance of axonal transport and translation in synapse formation and neuronal function. Utilizing advanced techniques like live cell imaging and microfluidic culture systems, Hengst's work also addresses the impact of cellular stressors, including amyloid-beta oligomers, on neuronal health and regeneration. By investigating these molecular interactions and signaling pathways, Hengst contributes valuable insights into promoting neuronal resilience and potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.
