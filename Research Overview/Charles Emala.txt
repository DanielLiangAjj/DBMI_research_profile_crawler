Researcher: Charles Emala
Research Overview:
Charles Emala's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily centered around the mechanisms of lung regeneration, the pathophysiology of asthma, and the influence of various pharmacological agents on respiratory health. His work investigates cellular responses to viral infections, particularly in the context of COVID-19, and explores the potential for alveolar regeneration through the roles of stem cells and basal cell biology. Emala also delves into the interactions between neurobiology and respiratory symptoms, examining how factors such as mast cells and neurobehavioral responses influence asthma and chronic lung inflammation. Moreover, he evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of natural supplements like ginger extract, focusing on its active constituents (gingerols and shogaols) in modulating the metabolic profile and pharmacokinetics related to asthma. His extensive studies on GABAA receptors and cyclic AMP signaling pathways provide insights into smooth muscle relaxation and airway hyperresponsiveness, crucial for developing novel bronchodilator therapies. Overall, Emalaâ€™s work contributes significantly to the understanding of lung disease mechanisms, particularly in asthma, while also offering promising avenues for regenerative medicine and targeted therapeutic strategies.
