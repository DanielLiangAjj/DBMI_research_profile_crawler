Researcher: Robert Carter
Research Overview:
Robert Carter's research encompasses a wide array of topics predominantly focused on understanding the complexities of human health, pathology, and responses to various therapeutic interventions. His work addresses significant issues such as age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction, which is linked to conditions like sarcopenia and mobility-disability, highlighting the need for effective function-promoting therapies. He has also made contributions to the field of cancer research, particularly through hospital-based cancer registries and studies on outcomes in oncology, including the behavior of cancer stem cells and chromosomal instability in neoplasms like glioblastoma. Additionally, Carter explores the intersection of infectious diseases and immune responses, particularly in the context of viral infections like influenza, pneumococcus, and their impact on metabolic pathways. His investigations extend to the implications of exercise on overall health, quantitative assessments of physical activity, and the psychological stressors faced by racial minority communities, demonstrating a commitment to comprehensive public health approaches. From innovative surgical techniques and patient-reported outcomes to the application of genome editing technologies, Carter's interdisciplinary research agenda aims to advance understanding and treatment of complex health issues, leveraging insights from molecular biology, clinical trials, and social determinants of health.
