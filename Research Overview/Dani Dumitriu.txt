Researcher: Dani Dumitriu
Research Overview:
Dani Dumitriu's research centers around the intersections of mental health, pediatric care, and the neurobiological underpinnings of caregiving, particularly during critical early life periods. Focusing on the centrality of relationships, Dumitriu investigates how parent-child interactions, especially in the context of postpartum mental health and maternal anxiety, contribute to child development and the long-term effects of early relational health. The impact of environmental stressors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, is evident as the research addresses disparities related to ethnicity and socioeconomic status in caregiving practices and health outcomes. By employing both clinical neuroscience and immunological perspectives, Dumitriu explores the neuroplasticity associated with caregiving behaviors, utilizing animal models to examine the effects of stress on cognitive aging and the mechanisms of neurodevelopment. This multi-disciplinary approach fosters a deeper understanding of responsive parenting, maternal confidence, and their implications for infant development and mental health, offering valuable insights for clinical practice and public health policy.
