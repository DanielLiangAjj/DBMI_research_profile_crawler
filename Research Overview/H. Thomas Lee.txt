Researcher: H. Thomas Lee
Research Overview:
H. Thomas Lee's research primarily investigates the mechanisms of cell death, specifically apoptosis and necrosis, in the context of inflammation and various injury models, particularly acute kidney injury (AKI) and ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). His studies emphasize the role of short-chain fatty acids like butyrate and propionate derived from the microbiome in modulating inflammatory responses and the apoptosis of neutrophils and macrophages. The research highlights the involvement of key signaling pathways, including NF-ÎºB and inflammasomes, in these processes. Furthermore, Lee explores the therapeutic potential of targeting these mechanisms, looking into biomarkers and pharmacological interventions that could mitigate acute kidney injury and its related inflammatory consequences. Overall, his work contributes significantly to understanding the interplay between cell death, inflammation, and kidney health, with wider implications for cardiovascular diseases and other inflammatory conditions.
