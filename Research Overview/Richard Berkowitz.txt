Researcher: Richard Berkowitz
Research Overview:
Richard Berkowitz's research focuses on two main areas: multimodal pain management in orthopedic surgery, specifically total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and issues surrounding neonatal thrombocytopenia in the context of pregnancy and fetal health. His work on TKA emphasizes the effectiveness of intravenous meloxicam as part of a comprehensive pain management strategy aimed at reducing length of hospital stay and overall healthcare costs while ensuring patient safety and quality of postoperative pain control. Concurrently, Berkowitz's investigations into neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) involve examining the immunological factors that contribute to conditions like thrombocytopenia and intracranial hemorrhage in newborns. This includes the role of intravenous immunoglobulins and their impact on fetal outcomes. His research spans clinical trials, cost-effectiveness analysis, and the development of guidelines to improve both maternal and neonatal health outcomes, bridging the fields of orthopedic surgery and obstetrics through a focus on pain and patient safety in diverse healthcare settings.
