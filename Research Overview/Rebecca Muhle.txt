Researcher: Rebecca Muhle
Research Overview:
Rebecca Muhle's research primarily focuses on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and its associated challenges within the domains of education, psychiatry, and developmental disabilities. Her work encompasses various interdisciplinary approaches, including the effects of genetic predispositions, particularly de novo mutations, on ASD. She leverages advanced methodologies such as statistical modeling, graph learning, and neural network interpretability to enhance clinical care and education strategies for affected individuals. Muhle also addresses the impact of factors like prenatal exposure to infectious diseases, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic, on developmental outcomes. Additionally, she explores the intersection of telepsychiatry with traditional psychiatric care, aiming to improve accessibility and support for diverse populations, including infants and children with intellectual disabilities. Overall, Muhle's comprehensive research aims to advance understanding and treatment of ASD through innovative genetic, psychological, and educational frameworks.
