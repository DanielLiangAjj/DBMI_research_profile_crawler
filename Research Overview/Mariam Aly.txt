Researcher: Mariam Aly
Research Overview:
Mariam Aly's research encompasses a wide range of topics primarily focusing on memory and cognitive processes, emphasizing interactions between episodic and semantic memory, the role of attention, and the underlying neural mechanisms. Through investigations into the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, among other brain regions, her work examines individual differences in memory capacity, the impact of temporal contexts, and how autonomic factors like familiar music influence autobiographical recall. Additionally, her studies explore the complexities of visual cognition, including perceptual decisions and event segmentation, as well as the implications of memory retrieval across various demographics, from children to the elderly. Another aspect of her research addresses the intersections between memory and oral health, particularly regarding the efficacy of antibacterial agents in managing oral bacteria, further showcasing a commitment to understanding cognitive processes in both clinical and everyday contexts. Overall, Aly's work provides valuable insights into the dynamics of memory and cognition, revealing the intricate relationships between neural functioning, attention, and long-term retention of information.
