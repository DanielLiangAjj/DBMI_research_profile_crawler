Researcher: Qi Yan
Research Overview:
Qi Yan's research encompasses a multifaceted exploration of genetic and environmental factors impacting fetal and maternal health, as well as the genetic predisposition to various diseases. His work prominently features advanced genetic testing techniques, including chromosomal microarray analysis and exome sequencing, to investigate fetal anomalies, genetic syndromes such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and congenital heart diseases. Yan also delves into the implications of maternal conditions, such as preterm birth, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and their subsequent effects on infant morbidity and mortality, through longitudinal studies and epidemiological approaches. Highlighting the importance of precision medicine, his research extends to evaluate the role of genetic markers, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and epigenetic factors, particularly DNA methylation, in diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Additionally, Yan employs modern data analysis techniques, including machine learning and meta-analyses, to better predict disease progression and outcomes, ultimately aiming to enhance prenatal diagnostics and maternal care strategies.
