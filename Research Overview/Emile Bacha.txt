Researcher: Emile Bacha
Research Overview:
Dr. Emile Bacha's research focuses on complex congenital heart diseases and various surgical interventions aimed at improving patient outcomes. His work delves into intricate matters such as biventricular repairs for conditions like double-inlet left and right ventricles, single-ventricle pathways, and the treatment of specific abnormalities like Ebstein anomaly and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. He extensively explores surgical techniques including the Ross procedure, Starnes operation, and valve replacements, emphasizing their durability and clinical efficacy. Bacha's investigations highlight the significance of preoperative assessment and postoperative care, evaluated through echocardiography and other imaging modalities, while addressing factors such as reinterventions, survival rates, and mortality risks across pediatric populations. Through his efforts in pediatric cardiac surgery, transplantation, and healthcare resource management, he aims to improve the quality and outcomes of care for infants, children, and adults with congenital cardiac conditions, ultimately contributing valuable insights into surgical standards and practices in resource-limited environments.
