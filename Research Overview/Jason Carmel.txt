Researcher: Jason Carmel
Research Overview:
Jason Carmel's research primarily focuses on understanding the mechanisms and therapeutic strategies related to motor recovery following neurological injuries, particularly involving the spinal cord, motor cortex, and their associated pathways. His work encompasses a variety of topics, including the application of electrical stimulation techniques, such as epidural and transcutaneous spinal stimulation, to enhance motor function and rehabilitation outcomes in conditions like cervical spinal cord injury, hemiplegia, and cerebral palsy. The researcher is particularly interested in the roles of neuroplasticity, neural interfaces, and the impact of different stimulation protocols on the recovery of motor function in both animal models and human subjects. Utilizing methods such as motor evoked potentials, non-invasive brain stimulation (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation), and advanced imaging techniques, Carmelâ€™s studies aim to elucidate the biological underpinnings of motor behavior and the efficacy of rehabilitation strategies on recovery, contributing to the broader field of neurorehabilitation and the development of innovative therapeutic approaches for enhancing motor skills and functionality.
