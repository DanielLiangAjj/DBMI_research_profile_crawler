Researcher: Aurel Lazar
Research Overview:
Aurel Lazar's research predominantly focuses on the intricate mechanisms of sensory processing in Drosophila melanogaster, utilizing advanced concepts from neuroscience and computational biology. His work explores critical phenomena such as divisive normalization and gain control, particularly in relation to motion detection and olfactory processing within the early olfactory system. Through detailed investigations of various neuronal types and their synaptic connections, Lazar effectively integrates connectomics and synaptomics to delineate the functional logic underlying neural encoding and decoding in complex circuits. His innovative approaches include implementing in silico models and channel identification machines to analyze multidimensional receptive fields and phase processing in relation to circadian rhythms. By employing cutting-edge techniques involving biophysical neuron models and interactive computing, Lazar enhances our understanding of neural dynamics, including the functional identification of sparse neural circuits and the encoding of visual and olfactory stimuli, ultimately contributing to a deeper comprehension of sensory integration and perception in both Drosophila and potential parallels in higher organisms.
