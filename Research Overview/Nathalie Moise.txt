Research Overview:
Nathalie Moise's research encompasses a wide array of critical areas within behavioral cardiology, particularly focusing on the interaction between mental health, chronic diseases, and health equity. Her work extensively explores the relationships between cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease and hypertension, and mental health disorders including depression and anxietyâ€”emphasizing the impact of socioeconomic factors, race, and gender differences. Employing implementation science, Moise is dedicated to developing and assessing innovative interventions to improve health outcomes, using methodologies like telemedicine and user-centered design. Her research also addresses the importance of collaborative care models, mental health integration into primary care, and community-based participatory research, particularly in the context of marginalized populations facing systemic racism and healthcare disparities.
