Researcher: Tarjinder Singh
Research Overview:
Tarjinder Singh's research is a multifaceted exploration of cellular and developmental neuroscience, focusing on the molecular interactions and genetic predispositions underlying psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. Utilizing advanced techniques such as proteomics and exome sequencing, Singh investigates loss-of-function variants and their implications in neurodevelopmental disorders, revealing significant connections between genetic variation and disease phenotypes. His work also extends into population genetics, analyzing polymorphisms and evolutionary aspects in specific species, particularly in relation to Arctic-alpine plants like *Sagina nodosa*. In a broader context, Singh's contributions to the biological and neurological sciences emphasize the complex interplay between genetics, cognitive function, and psychiatric conditions, paving the way for future therapeutic approaches and a deeper understanding of the genetic underpinnings of mental health disorders.
