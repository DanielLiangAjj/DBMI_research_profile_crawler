Researcher: Joanna Smeeton
Research Overview:
Joanna Smeeton's research predominantly focuses on cartilage biology and regenerative processes, particularly in the context of osteoarthritis and joint health. Utilizing zebrafish as a model organism, her work delves into the mechanisms of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, exploring genetic and developmental responses tied to skeletal remodeling and joint formation. Smeeton investigates key molecular factors such as Nkx3.2 and Mmp9, along with novel genome editing technologies like CRISPR and TALEN, to understand the underlying genetic regulation governing cartilage and skeletal development. Her studies contribute significant insights into the evolutionary biology of vertebrates, highlighting the potential of using zebrafish to model human conditions such as osteoarthritis and systemic diseases. By combining techniques from genomics, single-cell analysis, and experimental biology, Smeeton's work aims to elucidate pathways for cartilage regeneration, advancing the field of regenerative medicine and understanding the complexities of joint diseases.
