Researcher: Kevin Ochsner
Research Overview:
Kevin Ochsner's research primarily focuses on the interplay between emotional regulation, cognitive processes, and maladaptive behaviors such as those seen in various psychological disorders, including Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). His studies utilize advanced neuroimaging techniques, particularly functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), to explore neural emotion signatures and brain network dynamics related to emotion regulation strategies like cognitive reappraisal and attentional control. Ochsner's work delves into the neurobiological underpinnings of affective responses, craving, and social cognition, investigating how neural pathways such as those in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala influence emotional experiences and their regulation across different populations, including adolescents and individuals with alcohol use disorders. His findings contribute to understanding treatment mechanisms in psychotherapy, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and the role of mindfulness in improving emotional resilience and coping skills. Through his comprehensive approach combining machine learning, network analysis, and ecological momentary assessment, Ochsner's research offers significant insights into the mechanisms of emotion regulation and their implications for mental health interventions.
