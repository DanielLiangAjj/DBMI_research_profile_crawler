Researcher: Aliaa Abdelhakim
Research Overview:
Aliaa Abdelhakim's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily centered on neurological disorders and eye diseases, with a notable emphasis on genetic mutations and their implications for vision and cognitive function. The keywords highlight her work on conditions like compressive optic neuropathy, osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis, and hereditary retinopathy, alongside the exploration of the KIF1A and COQ2 genes. Her studies incorporate advanced imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography and multimodal imaging to assess retinal conditions, including macular edema and diabetic retinopathy. Abdelhakim has also explored the intersection of COVID-19 with ophthalmic manifestations, contributing to the understanding of pandemics and their epidemiological impact. Additionally, her research includes insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying axonal compression and ganglion cell health. Through her clinical and histopathological correlation studies, she aims to advance the diagnosis and treatment approaches across various ocular and neurological disorders. The application of genetic testing and awareness of syndromic conditions reflects her commitment to innovative research in both pediatric and adult populations, enhancing clinical outcomes in eye health and cognitive function.
