Researcher: Mitchell Benson
Research Overview:
Mitchell Benson's research primarily focuses on the intersection of oncology, particularly prostate and bladder cancers, and precision medicine. His work investigates crucial factors such as the genetic and biological markers that predict patient outcomes and drug responses. Specifically, he examines the role of Metformin, NKX3.1 expression, and oxidative stress in understanding tumor biology within prostate cancer. Additionally, his studies on bladder cancer encompass neoadjuvant therapy, cystectomy outcomes, and the efficacy of intravesical treatments like the BCG vaccine. Benson's research also delves into the concepts of clonal evolution and patient-derived organoids and xenografts, which provide tailored insights into tumor behavior. His commitment to improving patient lived experiences, such as quality of life post-treatment and survival analysis, is evident throughout his work. By revealing insights into biological aggressiveness, treatment failure, and various risk factors associated with neoplasm recurrence, his findings aim to enhance clinical decision-making and patient management strategies in urologic oncology. Ultimately, Benson's contributions aim to inform precision medicine approaches that align with individual patient profiles, leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes in cancer care.
