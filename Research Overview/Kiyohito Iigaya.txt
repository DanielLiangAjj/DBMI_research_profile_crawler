Researcher: Kiyohito Iigaya
Research Overview:
Kiyohito Iigaya's research encompasses a broad investigation into the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying decision-making processes across different species, including humans and animals such as rats and rhesus macaques. Core themes of the research involve understanding hierarchical structures in decision-making, value computation, aesthetics, and the interplay between these elements in both reinforcement learning and social neuroscience contexts. By employing advanced techniques such as fMRI and computational modeling, Iigaya explores aspects like memory consolidation, neuronal plasticity, and the role of prediction errors and surprise in decision outcomes. The integration of concepts from neuroscience—such as brain mapping of regions like the prefrontal and visual cortices—reveals insights into how aesthetic value and imitative behavior influence choice behavior. Overall, the research seeks to elucidate the complex dynamics of human cognition, learning, and reward mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of how both biological and psychological factors shape decision-making across individuals and species.
