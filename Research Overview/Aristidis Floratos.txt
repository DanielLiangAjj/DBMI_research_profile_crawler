Researcher: Aristidis Floratos
Research Overview:
Aristidis Floratos's research primarily focuses on the intricate dynamics of immune cell interactions, particularly involving dendritic cells, and the implications of cell surface receptors in immune responses and tumor progression. His work incorporates advanced gene editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas systems, to study the functionality and proliferation of various cell types, including both tumor cell lines and Jurkat cells. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and investigation of immune receptors, he explores mechanisms of signal transduction and the role of key proteins in immunologic responses in animal models. His studies also extend to the impact of genetic modifications, including gene knockout strategies, on cell behavior in contexts of neoplasms, using both mouse models and human-derived cells. Overall, Floratos's research contributes valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of immune system activation and regulation, with potential implications for therapeutic strategies in cancer and autoimmune diseases.
