Researcher: Li Qiang
Research Overview:
Li Qiang's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily centered around adiposity, metabolism, and the effects of aging on various biological systems. The work investigates the roles of critical factors such as estrogen receptor β, PPARγ, and various adipokines like adiponectin and leptin in metabolic dysfunction and obesity. The researcher explores mechanisms of adipose tissue remodeling, macrophage polarization, and the impact of chronic inflammation on health, particularly in the context of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Qiang’s studies also delve into regenerative processes in different tissues, including skin and lung, underlining a focus on cellular responses to injury and the potential for therapeutic interventions using nanoparticles and small molecule conjugates. His research further extends to understanding adipose tissue's plasticity, the roles of long non-coding RNAs, and the implications of metabolic disorders in aging. Collectively, Li Qiang’s findings contribute substantially to the understanding of metabolic regulation, inflammation, and the cellular mechanisms underlying chronic diseases, providing insights that could inform future therapeutic strategies.
