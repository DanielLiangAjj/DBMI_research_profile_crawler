Researcher: Carla Concepcion-Crisol
Research Overview:
Carla Concepcion-Crisol's research primarily focuses on the role of microRNAs and non-coding RNAs in adenocarcinomas, particularly non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Her studies utilize animal models, specifically genetically modified mice, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, encompassing gene expression regulation, neoplastic transformation, and metastasis. By employing techniques such as CLIP, RNA sequencing, and high-throughput analysis, she explores the interactions of these non-coding RNAs with various nuclear proteins and transcription factors, enabling a deeper understanding of their targets and functional implications in cancer progression. Moreover, her work examines the therapeutic potential of RNA-based interventions and CRISPR technologies in the treatment and prognosis of lung neoplasms, contributing significantly to the field of cancer genomics and therapeutics. Overall, Concepcion-Crisol's research underscores the intricate relationship between microRNAs, cancer biology, and potential avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies.
