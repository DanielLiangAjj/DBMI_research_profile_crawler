Researcher: Edmond Chan
Research Overview:
Edmond Chan's research predominantly focuses on the complexities of food allergies and their management, particularly in children. He explores innovative treatment strategies such as oral immunotherapy (OIT) and sublingual immunotherapy to induce desensitization in patients with specific food allergies, such as milk, peanut, and egg allergies. His work emphasizes the importance of protocol adherence and shared decision-making between healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers to improve treatment outcomes and quality of life. Chan also examines the economic burden of food allergies, including healthcare costs, and the psychological impact on families, particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. The integration of health economics and patient-centered care in allergy management highlights Chan's commitment to advancing clinical practices while addressing socio-economic factors in food allergy prevention and education. Overall, his multifaceted approach aims to enhance safety, efficacy, and accessibility of food allergy therapies, ultimately benefiting patients and their families through improved management strategies and outcomes.
