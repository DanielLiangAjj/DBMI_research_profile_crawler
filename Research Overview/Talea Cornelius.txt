Researcher: Talea Cornelius
Research Overview:
Talea Cornelius's research primarily focuses on understanding and addressing various aspects of behavior, psychological distress, and health outcomes through a dyadic lens, particularly in the context of couples and relationships. Her work explores the mechanisms of behavior change, measurement validity, and the efficacy of interventions, especially those delivered through telehealth and multimedia platforms. Key areas of investigation include the impact of psychological factors such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and emotional distress on relationship functioning and individual health, particularly in populations facing acute conditions like acute coronary syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. Her studies employ diverse methodologies, including quantitative methods, ecological momentary assessment, and daily diary methods, to capture the dynamics of close relationships and their influence on health outcomes. Additionally, she emphasizes the importance of social support, intimacy, and the socio-economic factors that shape health behaviors, particularly in underserved communities, highlighting the intricate interplay between mental health, relationship quality, and physical health. Through her work, Cornelius aims to develop strategies for effective behavior change interventions that can enhance health-related quality of life in individuals and couples facing chronic health challenges, particularly amid the sociocultural shifts seen during events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
