Researcher: Viraj Sanghvi
Research Overview:
Viraj Sanghvi's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms underpinning cellular signaling pathways, particularly the Hippo signaling pathway and its interactions with various proteins and kinases such as MAP4K and RAP2 GTPases. His work delves into the roles these signaling mechanisms play in cancer biology, including breast, lung, and hepatocellular carcinomas, as well as in drug resistance associated with therapies targeting the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). His studies encompass multiple elements of cellular dynamics, including the cytoskeleton, mechanotransduction, and the regulation of protein translation, particularly through factors like eIF4E and 4EBP1. Additionally, Sanghvi investigates oxidative stress responses mediated by KEAP1 and NRF2, as well as the implications of glycation and de-glycation processes on cellular health. Through a combination of mouse models, transcriptomic analysis, and ribosome footprinting techniques, Sanghvi's contributions enhance our understanding of tumor microenvironments and the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions in various malignancies. Overall, his work significantly advances the dialogue surrounding cancer treatment and the molecular underpinnings of cellular stress responses.
