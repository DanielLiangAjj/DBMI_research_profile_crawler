Researcher: George Hasko
Research Overview:
George Hasko's research focuses on the mechanisms of inflammation, immune response, and metabolic diseases, particularly in contexts such as sepsis, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and various forms of cardiomyopathy. His work extensively explores the roles of purinergic signaling, particularly through adenosine and its receptors (A2A, A2B), as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating intestinal inflammation and systemic effects during metabolic dysregulation. Hasko employs animal models, including rats and genetically modified mice, to understand how these pathways intersect with conditions like visceral hypersensitivity, obesity, chronic cardiovascular aging, and organ failure. By integrating transcriptomics and systems biology, he aims to unravel the complexities of immune cell polarization, inflammation resolution, and the metabolic impacts of adipose tissueâ€”ultimately seeking new therapeutic strategies for managing chronic inflammatory and metabolic disorders. His work highlights the significant connections between neuroimmunology, metabolic syndromes, and their ramifications for public health in inflammatory diseases and aging.
