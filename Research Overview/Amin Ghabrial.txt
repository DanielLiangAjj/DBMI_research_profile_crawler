Researcher: Amin Ghabrial
Research Overview:
Amin Ghabrial's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of cellular signaling and morphogenesis, particularly in the context of the Drosophila trachea. Central to this work is the analysis of key proteins such as CCM3, NDR, and mTOR, which are involved in hippo-like signaling pathways and metabolism regulation. The studies utilize techniques like mosaic analysis and mitotic recombination to explore the roles of kinases and other signaling molecules in processes such as tubular network formation and apical polarity. The relevance of these findings extends to understanding apoptosis regulation and organogenesis, with implications for developmental biology and potential applications in human health, particularly in disorders related to membrane proteins and signal transduction. Through a combination of genetic studies and cellular assays, Ghabrialâ€™s work contributes to unraveling the complex interactions governing cell size, polarity, and morphogenetic events, providing insights into both basic biology and clinical research.
