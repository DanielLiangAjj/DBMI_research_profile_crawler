Researcher: Qais Al-Awqati
Research Overview:
Qais Al-Awqati's research primarily focuses on the mechanisms underlying chronic kidney disease and the development of renal structures, particularly within the nephrology and cell biology domains. Key themes include the exploration of cell signaling pathways and their implications in inflammation, hypoxia, and autophagy, particularly in relation to kidney cell differentiation and the development of collecting ducts and intercalated cells. Investigations into gene regulation during developmental biology highlight the role of stem cells and their potential in kidney regeneration and nephron variability. Additionally, the research expands into microbiology, examining the interactions between uropathogenic Escherichia coli and kidney pathology. Utilizing various animal models, including transgenic mice, the studies aim to elucidate the associated genetic and physiological changes that contribute to acute and chronic renal insufficiencies. Overall, Al-Awqati's work significantly advances the understanding of kidney development and pathology, offering insights that may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for kidney diseases.
