Researcher: Stavros Thomopoulos
Research Overview:
Stavros Thomopoulos is a prominent researcher focused on the intricate biology and biomechanics of tendon development, injury, and repair, particularly emphasizing the rotator cuff and its associated entheses. His work explores critical molecular and cellular pathways, including Hedgehog signaling, TGFÎ², and the roles of transcription factors such as Gli1 in tendon regeneration and differentiation. Through the use of various animal models, including mice and canine systems, he investigates the mechanics of tendon-to-bone insertion, the effects of mechanical loading on tendon health, and the implications of factors like inflammation and muscle wasting. His research also delves into tissue engineering strategies using bioadhesive materials and scaffolds for effective tendon repair, examining the influence of growth factors like IGF-1 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) on healing outcomes. By integrating knowledge from biomechanics, regenerative medicine, and advanced imaging techniques, Thomopoulos aims to enhance our understanding of tendon pathology and promote better treatment modalities for tendon injuries and conditions like tendinopathy.
