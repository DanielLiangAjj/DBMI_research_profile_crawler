Researcher: Andrew Teich
Research Overview:
Andrew Teich's research predominantly centers around the multifaceted aspects of Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. His work explores critical themes such as disparities in disease prevalence among minoritized groups, the disease mechanisms linked to neurodegeneration, and the intricate roles of various pathologies like tauopathies and Lewy pathology. Employing cutting-edge methodologies, including multi-omics approaches, whole genome sequencing, and precision medicine strategies, Teich's research aims to elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease. His investigations extend to histology and neuropathology through autopsy studies, highlighting findings in brain banks and biobanks to advance knowledge of aging and dementia. Additionally, Teich's studies examine the cognitive implications of Alzheimer's and evaluate blood-based biomarkers and neuropsychological tests, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive understanding of cognitive dysfunction. Overall, Teich's research contributes significantly to the understanding of Alzheimerâ€™s disease, bridging genetic studies with clinical implications and potential therapeutic strategies, particularly in diverse and aging populations.
