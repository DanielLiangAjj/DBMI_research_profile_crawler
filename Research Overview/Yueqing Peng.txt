Researcher: Yueqing Peng
Research Overview:
Yueqing Peng's research primarily investigates the intricate relationships between neuronal function, sensory processing, and sleep, with a particular focus on the dentate gyrus and its role in epilepsy and sensory coding. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as calcium imaging, two-photon imaging, and fiber photometry, the research delves into calcium signaling mechanisms and neuronal activity during microarousals and various sleep states. By exploring genetic factors associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and seizure activity, including absence seizures, the work aims to unravel the underlying neural circuits and molecular pathways. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how perturbations in neuronal signaling and synaptic transmission may lead to neurological conditions, while also shedding light on sensory processing and the brain's response to stimuli, thus bridging gaps in molecular neuroscience, sleep research, and sensory neuroscience.
