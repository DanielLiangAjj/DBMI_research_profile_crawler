Researcher: Michael Gershon
Research Overview:
Michael Gershon's research primarily focuses on the enteric nervous system (ENS), its development, and its implications in various gastrointestinal disorders. He has extensively studied the role of neurotrophic factors, such as GDF11 and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), in neurogenesis and gliogenesis within the ENS, highlighting the importance of these factors in the context of conditions like Hirschsprung's disease and inflammatory bowel disease. His work investigates the interplay between the neuroimmune system, serotonergic signaling, and gastrointestinal motility, delving into sex differences in these processes. Furthermore, Gershon explores the therapeutic potential of pluripotent stem cells and cell-based therapies for regenerative medicine aimed at the ENS, along with the implications of microbial interactions in gastrointestinal health. In addition to nervous system disorders, his research spans vaccine efficiency against the varicella-zoster virus and herpes zoster, offering insights into virology and immunological responses. Collectively, his findings significantly advance the understanding of the ENS's role in both health and disease, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies.
