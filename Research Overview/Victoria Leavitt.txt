Researcher: Victoria Leavitt
Research Overview:
Victoria Leavitt's research focuses on the cognitive and emotional aspects of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), particularly the interplay between brain resilience, cognitive impairment, and psychosocial factors such as loneliness, depression, and social support. Utilizing advanced neuroimaging techniques like MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, her studies explore how MS affects various cognitive domains, including memory, executive function, and motor skills. Leavitt's work also examines how demographic factors, including sex differences, influence cognitive outcomes and the effectiveness of interventions, such as exercise and disease-modifying therapies. Additionally, she is interested in the impact of psychological resilience and social networks on the quality of life and mental health of MS patients, especially in the context of recent challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. Through her multidisciplinary approach, incorporating machine learning and neuropsychological assessments, Leavitt aims to enhance our understanding of MSâ€™s complexities and improve patient care strategies.
