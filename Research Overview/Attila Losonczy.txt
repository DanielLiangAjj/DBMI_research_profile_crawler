Researcher: Attila Losonczy
Research Overview:
Attila Losonczy's research primarily explores the intricate dynamics of neuronal circuits in the hippocampus, particularly focusing on the mechanisms underlying learning, memory, and neurogenesis. Utilizing advanced techniques such as in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, he investigates adult-born granule cells in the dentate gyrus and their roles in pattern separation, synaptic plasticity, and spatial navigation. Key themes in his work include the exploration of cellular excitability and the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, especially pyramidal cells and interneurons, in consolidating memory and facilitating reward learning. His studies also delve into neurophysiological processes, such as sharp-wave ripples and their relation to memory consolidation, while employing sophisticated methodologies like optogenetics and multi-modal imaging to elucidate these complex neural networks. Overall, Losonczy's contributions significantly enhance our understanding of the cellular and molecular foundations of cognitive functions and their implications for conditions like epilepsy.
