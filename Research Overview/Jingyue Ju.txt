Researcher: Jingyue Ju
Research Overview:
Jingyue Ju's research focuses primarily on the molecular mechanisms and antiviral strategies related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. The studies emphasize the evaluation of various compounds, including flavonoids and nucleotide analogues, as potential antiviral agents against coronaviruses by targeting essential viral proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and exonucleases. Utilizing advanced techniques such as molecular docking simulations, nanopore sequencing, and high-throughput nucleotide sequencing, Ju explores the efficacy of drug combinations and natural products in inhibiting viral replication. Additionally, the research delves into the genomic study of viruses, the design of antiviral agents, and the application of biosensing technologies for enhanced virus detection. By combining molecular biology with computational strategies, Ju aims to contribute significantly to the development of innovative therapeutic approaches to combat COVID-19 and other viral infections.
