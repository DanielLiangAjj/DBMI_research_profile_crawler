Researcher: Jose Gutierrez
Research Overview:
Dr. Jose Gutierrez's research primarily focuses on the intersections of cerebrovascular health, aging, and cognitive function, particularly in relation to Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. His work extensively utilizes advanced neuroimaging techniques, notably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), to explore arterial stiffness, blood pressure dynamics, and the morphological characteristics of brain arteries across diverse populations, including those with Down syndrome and various ethnic backgrounds. Key research themes include the impact of inflammation and dietary factors (such as Mediterranean diets and oily fish intake) on cerebrovascular diseases, as well as the role of genetic predisposition to conditions like cerebral small vessel disease and Alzheimer’s disease, with a focus on genome-wide association studies that investigate polymorphisms linked to arterial health. Additionally, Gutierrez examines the complex relationships between hypertension, vascular remodeling, and cognitive decline, emphasizing societal and ethnic disparities in cerebrovascular health. This comprehensive approach integrates population-based epidemiological studies and clinical cohorts, ultimately aiming to improve our understanding of how vascular conditions influence cognitive aging and the prevalence of dementia in varied demographic settings.
