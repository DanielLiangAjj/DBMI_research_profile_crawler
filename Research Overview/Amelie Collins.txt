Researcher: Amelie Collins
Research Overview:
Amelie Collins' research primarily focuses on the mechanisms of hematopoiesis and myelopoiesis during critical developmental stages, particularly in fetuses and neonates. She investigates the roles of hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors in conditions such as neutropenia and hypoxicâ€“ischemic encephalopathy, exploring how factors like interleukin-10 and maternal-fetal crosstalk influence these processes. Additionally, her work addresses the effects of various treatments, including sodium bicarbonate and therapeutic hypothermia, on acid-base homeostasis and resuscitation outcomes in neonates with infectious diseases, sepsis, and congenital conditions. By integrating insights from immunology and pediatrics, Collins aims to enhance understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways involved in neonatal health and disease, contributing to advancements in neonatal care and interventions.
