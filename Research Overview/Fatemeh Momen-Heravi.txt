Researcher: Fatemeh Momen-Heravi
Research Overview:
Fatemeh Momen-Heravi's research is characterized by a multidisciplinary approach that integrates gene editing technologies, particularly CRISPR-Cas systems, with investigations into the roles of extracellular vesicles and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in various health contexts, including cancer and inflammation. Her work spans a range of conditions, notably basal cell carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and examines the implications of immune profiling, tumor microenvironment, and macrophage dynamics in response to various treatments, including immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapies. She also explores disparities in healthcare, specifically related to surgical outcomes in skin cancer and dental implant success, highlighting the importance of racial and ethnic considerations. Momen-Heravi's investigations into periodontitis and other inflammatory conditions further elucidate the link between oral health and systemic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and liver fibrosis, through mechanisms involving macrophage activation and cytokine signaling pathways. Overall, her research contributes significant insights into cancer biology, immune dynamics, and the potential for innovative therapeutic strategies derived from genetic and extracellular biomarker studies.
