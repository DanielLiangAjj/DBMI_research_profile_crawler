Researcher: Osama Al Dalahmah
Research Overview:
Osama Al Dalahmah's research focuses on understanding neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) through innovative approaches like disease modeling using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and advanced sequencing technologies, including single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). His work investigates the role of various cellular components, such as microglia and astrocytes, in neuroinflammation and neurogenesis, exploring how these elements contribute to conditions like hypoxia and ischemia. Al Dalahmah also examines the interactions between genetic mutations—such as MAPT N279K—and factors like osteopontin and galectin-3 in these complex brain pathologies. By analyzing the transcriptomes of affected neurons and examining the tumor microenvironment in glial tumors, he aims to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying brain disorders. Such research not only contributes to our understanding of the cellular and molecular drivers of neurodegeneration but also has the potential to inform therapeutic strategies and interventions for these debilitating diseases, importantly in the context of viral afflictions such as COVID-19.
