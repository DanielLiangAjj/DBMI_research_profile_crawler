Researcher: Hemali Phatnani
Research Overview:
Hemali Phatnani's research primarily focuses on the genetic and molecular underpinnings of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and related neurodegenerative conditions. Key areas of investigation include rare-variant analyses, burden testing, and the application of advanced techniques like single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to understand the cellular mechanisms involved in ALS and peripheral lateral sclerosis (PLS). By utilizing various cell models, including human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and high-content imaging, Phatnani aims to elucidate the roles of RNA-binding proteins, neuroinflammation, and non-cell autonomous processes in disease progression. The integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and machine learning methodologies is central to her work, enabling the identification of novel genetic predispositions and biomarkers. Additionally, her research extends to exploring host-pathogen interactions and the transcriptomic responses associated with COVID-19, reflecting a broader interest in how environmental factors influence neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, Phatnani's contributions significantly advance the understanding of ALS and its relationship with genetic variation, cellular responses, and potential therapeutic avenues.
