Researcher: David Bickers
Research Overview:
David Bickers' research encompasses a broad range of topics within dermatology, with a particular focus on skin neoplasms, including melanoma and basal cell carcinoma. His work delves into the molecular underpinnings of these cancers, particularly the role of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and associated proteins such as Bcl3, Shh, and Patched-1. Bickers investigates immunological aspects like MRGPRX2 and lymphocyte transformation tests to better understand allergic reactions and their mechanisms, especially in relation to non-Î²-lactam antibiotics, photosensitivity, and other skin conditions. His studies also emphasize the importance of primary and secondary prevention in skin cancer, particularly the role of sun safety and sunscreen usage in reducing cancer risk. Additionally, he employs murine models for experimental research, contributing to the understanding of gene expression regulation and cell proliferation within the context of neoplastic processes. Overall, Bickers' research is pivotal in advancing knowledge on skin cancer mechanisms and enhancing strategies for prevention and treatment in dermatologic oncology.
