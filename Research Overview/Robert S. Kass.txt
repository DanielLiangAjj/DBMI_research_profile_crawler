Researcher: Robert S. Kass
Research Overview:
Robert S. Kass's research primarily revolves around the biochemistry and cellular biology of ion channels, particularly focusing on the KCNQ1 potassium channel, its involvement in long QT syndrome, and related cardiovascular physiology. His work extensively examines the mechanisms of ion channel regulation and trafficking, highlighting the role of calmodulin and phosphorylation in channelopathies and arrhythmias. Through methodologies like high-throughput screening, kernel electrophysiology, and genetic modeling using induced pluripotent stem cells, Kass investigates cellular responses to pharmacological agents such as mexiletine and propranolol, contributing to drug development and disease modeling. His studies also address genetic mutations that impact channel functions, thereby enhancing understanding of cardiovascular health and disease, particularly in relation to arrhythmias and pulmonary hypertension. Overall, his research integrates chemical biology with clinical implications, aiming to uncover novel therapeutic strategies for ion channel-related disorders.
