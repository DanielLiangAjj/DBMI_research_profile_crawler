Researcher: Wellington V. Cardoso
Research Overview:
Wellington V. Cardoso's research focuses on various aspects of lung development and regeneration, with a keen interest in epithelial differentiation and the roles of stem cells within these processes. His work utilizes evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) concepts to explore mechanisms of lung evolution and the regeneration of airway epithelium across different species, including mice, snakes, and humans. Key themes in Cardoso's research include the differentiation of basal cells, tuft cells, and various progenitor cell types, alongside the regulation of signaling pathways such as Notch, BMP, and Hippo; these pathways are critical in guiding developmental signaling and cellular communication during organogenesis. His investigations also extend to the implications of cellular responses in the context of diseases, including COVID-19 and chronic conditions like bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Through techniques such as organotypic cultures, transcriptomics, and lineage tracing, Cardoso aims to uncover novel insights into lung repair mechanisms and potential therapeutic avenues in regenerative medicine. The overarching goal of his research is to translate findings into innovative strategies relevant to lung repair, regeneration, and the better understanding of pulmonary diseases, thereby bridging basic science with clinical applications.
