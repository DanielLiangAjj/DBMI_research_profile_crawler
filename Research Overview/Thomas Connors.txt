Researcher: Thomas Connors
Research Overview:
Thomas Connors' research encompasses a comprehensive exploration of immunology, particularly focusing on the immune responses in infants and children, with a notable emphasis on diseases related to viral infections, including COVID-19 and its long-term effects. His work delves into the mechanisms of developmental immunity, highlighting the roles of natural killer cells, T cells, and mucosal immunity in pediatric populations. Connors investigates the pathobiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of post-viral syndromes such as Long COVID, alongside the implications of vaccinations, particularly mRNA vaccines. He employs advanced techniques such as imaging mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze immune responses and inflammation within various lymphoid tissues, contributing to the understanding of immunological memory and tissue-resident memory T cells. Overall, his research significantly advances the fields of pediatric immunology, global health, and the epidemiology of infectious diseases, particularly in the context of emerging viral threats and chronic inflammatory conditions in children.
