Researcher: Tom Maniatis
Research Overview:
Tom Maniatis' research encompasses a broad spectrum of studies focused primarily on the implications of COVID-19, specifically the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including vaccine efficacy, breakthrough infections, and the immune response in the context of variants of concern. Significant emphasis is placed on mechanistic insights into neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and schizophrenia, exploring the roles of various proteins including Î³-protocadherins, TBK1, and autophagy-related pathways in neuronal health and disease. His work integrates developmental biology and neuroscience to investigate axonal branching, synaptic formation, and cellular interactions within neural circuits, while employing advanced methodologies like whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing. Furthermore, Maniatis addresses the epigenetic factors influencing gene expression and the potential for stem cell applications in disease modeling and therapy. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining immunology, genomics, and neurobiology, his research aims to elucidate the interactions between infectious diseases, genetic predisposition, and neurodegeneration, contributing to the understanding of complex biological systems and aiding in the development of therapeutic strategies.
