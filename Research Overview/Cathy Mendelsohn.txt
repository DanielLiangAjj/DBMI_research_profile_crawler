Researcher: Cathy Mendelsohn
Research Overview:
Cathy Mendelsohn’s research focuses on the intricacies of cancer biology, particularly bladder cancer, field carcinogenesis, and the molecular mechanisms underlying urothelial development and differentiation. Her work explores various aspects such as the impact of genetic and epigenetic factors—like DNA methylation and histone modifications—on tumorigenesis and cancer progression in urothelial and head and neck cancers. Mendelsohn utilizes mouse models to investigate congenital anomalies of the urinary tract and the role of specific genes, such as DSTYK and EZH2, in these processes. Additionally, her research delves into the urobiome's influence on urinary tract infections and dysbiosis, examining the interplay between the mucosal microenvironment and immune evasion in cancer progression. Through a multidimensional approach that combines molecular diagnostic techniques, genetic studies, and targeted therapies, her findings contribute significantly to understanding bladder cancer's pathophysiology and potential therapeutic avenues for associated kidney diseases and urogenital disorders.
