Researcher: Wassim Elyaman
Research Overview:
Wassim Elyaman's research focuses on the intersection of immunology and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease. He investigates the roles of T cells, microglia, and various signaling pathways in the context of neuroinflammation and autoimmune responses. His work emphasizes the importance of genetic factors, such as polygenic risk scores, gene expression, and specific transcription factors (e.g., STAT1, STAT3, Sox9), in understanding the genotype-phenotype correlation within neurodegenerative conditions. Elyaman also explores the implications of cytokines, including interleukin-9 and interleukin-27, on T cell differentiation and regulatory functions, shedding light on their contributions to diseases like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. His multidisciplinary approach includes high-content drug screening and the investigation of neural stem cell behavior in the subventricular zone, aiming to uncover novel therapeutic strategies for managing neurodegenerative disorders and enhancing transplantation tolerance. Overall, his research significantly contributes to our understanding of the immunological underpinnings of neurodegeneration and the potential for targeted immunomodulatory interventions.
