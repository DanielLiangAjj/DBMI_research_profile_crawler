Researcher: Adam Bass
Research Overview:
Adam Bass's research focuses on the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic strategies related to gastrointestinal cancers, notably gastric and esophageal cancers, as well as colorectal cancer. His work encompasses various aspects of molecular oncology, exploring topics such as microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch repair deficiency, synthetic lethality, and the role of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes like TP53 and BRCA1 in cancer progression. He investigates the tumor microenvironment, signal transduction pathways (including EGFR and ERBB2 signaling), and the potential of targeted therapies and immunotherapy to enhance treatment outcomes. Utilizing advanced technologies such as whole exome sequencing, organoids, and patient-derived models, Bass seeks to identify genetic biomarkers for risk stratification and develop personalized medicine approaches. This multidisciplinary approach underlines his commitment to unravel complex interactions in cancer biology, with the ultimate goal of improving early detection, therapeutic efficacy, and patient survival in gastrointestinal neoplasms.
