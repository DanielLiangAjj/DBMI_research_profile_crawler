Researcher: Zhenpeng Dai
Research Overview:
Zhenpeng Dai's research is centered around understanding the immune mechanisms and therapeutic avenues related to alopecia areata, an autoimmune condition characterized by hair loss. By utilizing cutting-edge techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing, Dai investigates T cell dynamics, particularly focusing on T cell subsets like CD8-positive T-lymphocytes, T cell exhaustion, and the role of cytokines including Oncostatin M and interferon gamma in influencing hair follicle biology. The research emphasizes the significance of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in autoimmunity and explores innovative strategies for personalized medicine and drug development aimed at modulating the immune response in alopecia areata. Additionally, Dai's work incorporates elements of systems biology and artificial intelligence to predict drug efficacy and tailor therapies, representing a comprehensive approach to addressing the complexities of autoimmunity in dermatology. Overall, the research aims to bridge the gap between basic immunological findings and clinical applications, paving the way for improved treatment outcomes in patients with alopecia areata.
