Researcher: Suzanne Lentzsch
Research Overview:
Dr. Suzanne Lentzsch's research primarily focuses on advancing the understanding and treatment of multiple myeloma and related plasma cell dyscrasias, particularly in the context of relapsed/refractory cases and systemic AL amyloidosis. Utilizing innovative triplet combinations and novel agents such as pomalidomide, selinexor, and daratumumab, her studies aim to enhance patient outcomes while accounting for high-risk factors and extensive prior treatment regimens. Her work includes meticulous investigations into hematologic responses, therapy tolerability, and overall survival metrics, supported by extensive clinical trials and retrospective studies. Additionally, Dr. Lentzsch emphasizes the significance of biomarker utilization, immunologic factors, and imaging techniques in diagnosing, staging, and managing these conditions, thereby contributing to the establishment of consensus guidelines for treatment and risk stratification. Through her multidisciplinary approach combining insights from hematology, immunology, and epidemiology, Dr. Lentzsch strives to innovate therapeutic strategies that could potentially transform care for patients with these complex malignancies.
