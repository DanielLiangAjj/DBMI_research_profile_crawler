Researcher: Steven J Shea
Research Overview:
Steven J. Shea's research focuses on the interplay between cardiovascular health, respiratory conditions, and the effects of vitamin D on overall mortality and prognosis, particularly in older populations. His work encompasses investigations into the causes of death linked to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and myocardial infarction, highlighting the cumulative impact of these conditions across diverse racial and ethnic groups. Shea explores important biomarkers such as parathyroid hormone and vitamin D, addressing issues like vitamin D deficiency and its standardization for improving health outcomes. Additionally, his studies delve into sleep-disordered breathing and its associations with chronic respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung diseases. By employing various methodologies including randomized clinical trials, observational cohort studies, and advanced imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Shea aims to refine risk assessment and develop targeted strategies for fracture prevention and risk management in aging individuals. His comprehensive research underscores the complexity of these interrelated health issues and provides valuable insights for clinical epidemiology and preventive medicine.
