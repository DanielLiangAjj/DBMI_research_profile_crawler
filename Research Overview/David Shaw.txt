Researcher: David Shaw
Research Overview:
David Shaw's research encompasses a wide range of topics primarily focused on the intersection of health, genetics, ethical considerations in healthcare, and environmental influences on public health. He has extensively explored genetic analysis through techniques such as cgMLST and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), particularly in relation to infectious diseases like Hepatitis C and SARS-CoV-2. His work addresses critical issues in patient-centered care and involves participatory research, focusing on rare diseases such as Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, highlighting the socioeconomic burden faced by patients. Shaw also significantly engages with the ethical implications of AI in healthcare, advocating for responsible AI guidelines and decision-making processes. His insights into animal experimentation and associated laws reflect a commitment to improving animal welfare in research contexts. Additionally, Shaw's investigation into climate change and its consequences on health underscores the need for sustainable practices in public health. Through a blend of observational studies, qualitative research, and advanced computational biology, his contributions help bridge gaps between clinical practices, ethical standards, and public health policies, creating a comprehensive framework that informs better healthcare delivery and research integrity globally.
