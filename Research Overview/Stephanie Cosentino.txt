Researcher: Stephanie Cosentino
Research Overview:
Stephanie Cosentino's research encompasses a comprehensive examination of the relationships between essential tremor (ET), cognitive decline, and various neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Her work utilizes numerous methodologies, including longitudinal and prospective studies, cohort analysis, and genome-wide association studies to delve into pathophysiological mechanisms, biomarkers, genetic predispositions, and the impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms like sleep disturbances and depression on cognitive functioning. Cosentino's findings highlight the cognitive performance aspects of ET, such as episodic memory and executive function, while also investigating the implications of inflammation and other risk factors on aging, longevity, and dementia progression. Furthermore, her research emphasizes the importance of caregiver burden and the socio-economic factors influencing dementia care, contributing valuable insights into the clinical, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of essential tremor and related disorders.
