Researcher: Jonathan Barasch
Research Overview:
Jonathan Barasch's research primarily focuses on kidney health, including the mechanisms underlying acute and chronic kidney injuries, and the role of various biological factors in kidney disease and regeneration. He investigates both cellular and molecular aspects, such as the role of stem cells, endothelial cells, and biomarkers like NGAL in kidney pathology. His work also encompasses the inflammatory processes involved in conditions like urinary tract infections and the impact of systems such as the renin-angiotensin system on renal function. Additionally, Barasch applies advanced methodologies, including single-cell transcriptomics and cryo-electron microscopy, to explore complex interactions in cellular regeneration and responses to stressors like hyperoxia and infection (notably COVID-19). By integrating insights from nephrology, immunology, and developmental biology, his research aims to uncover novel therapeutic pathways and biomarkers for better precision medicine in kidney diseases, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes in pediatric and adult populations alike.
