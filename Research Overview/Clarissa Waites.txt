Researcher: Clarissa Waites
Research Overview:
Clarissa Waitesâ€™ research focuses on the interplay between glucocorticoids, tau protein dynamics, and their implications in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Through innovative methodologies such as live cell imaging, microfluidic techniques, and the study of extracellular vesicles and exosomes, Waites investigates how stress and glucocorticoids influence tau propagation, mitochondrial function, and synaptic integrity. Her work explores the molecular pathways involved in unconventional protein secretion, axonal transport, and synaptic transmission, shedding light on the mechanisms governing synaptic autophagy and proteostasis. The implications of her findings extend to precision medicine, biomarker development for disease progression, and potential therapeutic interventions for cognitive dysfunction. Ultimately, her research underscores the critical relationship between stress responses and neurodegeneration, aiming to contribute to a better understanding of the cellular processes underlying these complex disorders.
