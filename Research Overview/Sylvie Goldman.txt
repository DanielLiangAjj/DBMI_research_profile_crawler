Researcher: Sylvie Goldman
Research Overview:
Sylvie Goldman's research primarily focuses on the HNRNPH2 gene and its association with neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly HNRNPH2-related neurodevelopmental disorder (HNRNPH2-RNDD) and Rett Syndrome. Her studies investigate movement behaviors, motor function, and the developmental challenges faced by children with these disorders, often emphasizing the importance of caregiver strategies and assessment measures. The research also delves into the implications of genetic factors, such as deletions on chromosome 16p11.2, and the epidemiological aspects of neurodevelopmental disorders in the context of influences like the COVID-19 pandemic. By employing methods such as pose estimation and volumetric brain analysis, Goldman aims to enhance the understanding of autism spectrum disorders, motor development, and the overall neurodevelopmental trajectory of affected children. Her work underscores the need for effective diagnosis, support mechanisms, and the impact of environmental factors on the development and well-being of children with these conditions.
