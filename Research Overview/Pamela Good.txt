Researcher: Pamela Good
Research Overview:
Pamela Good's research primarily focuses on chronic kidney disease and its implications within nephrology, while also exploring the critical area of early-onset sepsis, particularly in pediatric populations. Her work encompasses the development and application of sepsis risk assessment tools, such as the sepsis calculator, which aim to enhance clinical decision-making through serial physical examinations. In addition, her studies involve a comprehensive analysis of kidney-related conditions, including acute kidney injury and renal insufficiency, utilizing various models including animal research. Good's research is further enriched by her examination of factors influencing healthcare practices, medical education, and clinical competence, particularly in the context of neonatal and pediatric health. Overall, her contributions significantly advance the understanding of kidney health and the management of sepsis in vulnerable populations, reflecting a dedicated effort to improve clinical outcomes in nephrology and pediatrics.
