Researcher: Sabrina Simoes
Research Overview:
Sabrina Simoes’ research focuses on the intricate roles of endo-lysosomal dysfunction and the endosomal trafficking pathways in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease and Niemann-Pick type C disease. Through the exploration of biomarkers such as cholesterol and tau proteins, as well as the characterization of extracellular vesicles like exosomes, her work delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying lysosomal storage disorders and related conditions. By utilizing proteomic analyses on human brain tissue and various mouse models, she investigates the impact of lysosomal function and gene therapy strategies in modifying pathways associated with diseases exemplified by juvenile CLN3 disease and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Notably, her studies on proteins related to the retromer complex, such as VPS26b, SORL1, and VPS35, offer insights into their roles in endosomal transport and neuronal health. Simoes’ interdisciplinary approach links cellular transport processes to the broader implications of neuroimaging findings in cerebrovascular disease, enhancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.
