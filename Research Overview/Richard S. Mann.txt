Researcher: Richard S. Mann
Research Overview:
Richard S. Mann's research focuses on the intricate roles of transcription factors in gene regulation and development, primarily using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. His work emphasizes the significance of DNA binding specificity and the functional implications of missense mutations within transcription factor families, notably the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain proteins. Mann's investigations into genome engineering techniques, including CRISPR/Cas9 and site-specific recombination, facilitate the exploration of gene regulatory networks involved in processes such as appendage development and neurogenesis. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as ChIP-seq and fluorescence microscopy, his studies provide insights into 3D nuclear architecture and local transcription factor concentration, enhancing our understanding of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, Mann employs machine learning approaches to interpret biophysical interactions between proteins and DNA, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation, evolutionary dynamics, and the impact of epigenetic modifications on DNA shape and binding characteristics. Overall, his research integrates developmental biology and neuroscience, revealing fundamental mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic control in organismal development and function.
