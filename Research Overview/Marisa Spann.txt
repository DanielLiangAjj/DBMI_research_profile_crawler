Researcher: Marisa Spann
Research Overview:
Marisa Spann's research is centered around understanding the intricate interplay between prenatal and early postnatal factors that influence brain development and cognitive functioning in infants and children. By utilizing advanced neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging, and electroencephalography, her studies explore the effects of maternal health, environmental stressors, and genetic influences on the developing brain. Key themes in her work include the investigation of heart rate variability (HRV) as an indicator of autonomic nervous system functioning, the implications of maternal immune activation on offspring brain morphology, and the intergenerational transmission of mental health disorders like autism and ADHD. Additionally, her research integrates machine learning approaches and predictive modeling to identify biomarkers for cognitive and emotional outcomes in vulnerable populations. Overall, Spann's work contributes significantly to the field of developmental neuroscience and maternal-child health, with a focus on identifying risk factors and understanding the mechanisms underlying infant brain development.
