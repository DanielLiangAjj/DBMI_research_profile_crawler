Researcher: Steven Siegelbaum
Research Overview:
Steven Siegelbaum's research centers on the complex interplays within the hippocampus, particularly focusing on the roles of the CA1 and CA2 regions in memory processing, social behavior, and epilepsy. His work examines the functionality and plasticity of pyramidal neurons, exploring mechanisms like NMDA receptor interactions, synaptic integration, and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Siegelbaum employs advanced techniques such as optogenetics, calcium imaging, and two-photon imaging to study neuronal behavior in animal models, particularly mice. His investigations into social memory, sensory coding, and the modulation of memory recall have provided insights into the neural circuits underlying familiarity and novelty discrimination. Additionally, he explores the impacts of hyperexcitability and neuroactive substances on seizure activity, contributing significantly to our understanding of temporal lobe epilepsy and related disorders. Overall, his interdisciplinary approach merges behavioral neuroscience with molecular and cellular mechanisms, shedding light on cognitive processes and their implications for neurological diseases.
