Researcher: Michael Lipton
Research Overview:
Michael Lipton's research is centered on various aspects related to aging, cognition, and brain health, particularly focusing on neuroimaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). His work explores how factors like cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and brain structure correlate with cognitive function, mobility, and the impact of conditions such as multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Lipton investigates how repetitive subconcussive head impacts, commonly experienced in sports like soccer, contribute to cognitive impairment and the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the importance of understanding the long-term effects of such injuries. By examining the interplay between aging, brain function, and risk factors like depression and apathy, his research aims to enhance our understanding of cognitive reserve and its role in resilience against cognitive decline. Furthermore, Lipton's studies extend to the implications of hormonal influences on cognitive processes and the effects of community mobility on the quality of life in older adults. Overall, his multidisciplinary approach integrates neuropsychology, imaging, and clinical outcomes to provide insights into brain health across the lifespan.
