Researcher: Donna Farber
Research Overview:
Donna Farber's research significantly contributes to understanding T cell biology and immunological responses in various contexts, particularly in infants and children. Her work elucidates the intricate mechanisms governing tissue-resident memory T cells, which play a pivotal role in adaptive and mucosal immunity, revealing their importance in protecting against infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Through innovative methodologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and advanced imaging techniques, Farber investigates the development of immunity against respiratory diseases and the impact of the tumor microenvironment on immune cell behavior. Her studies highlight the implications of immunosenescence and the heterogeneity of immune responses across different age groups, shedding light on the nuances of infant and aging immunity. Moreover, her exploration of the interplay between innate and adaptive immune systems underscores the critical roles of various T cell subsets, regulatory mechanisms, and the microbiota's influence on immune homeostasis. Overall, Farber's multifaceted research underscores the complexities of human immunology and offers insights necessary for advancing vaccine strategies, immunotherapies, and understanding disease susceptibility.
