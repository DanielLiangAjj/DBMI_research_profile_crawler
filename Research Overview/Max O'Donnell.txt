Researcher: Max O'Donnell
Research Overview:
Max O'Donnell's research focus is primarily centered around critical diseases and health disparities, with a notable emphasis on respiratory conditions like ARDS and its relationship with COVID-19, as well as the management of drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and HIV/AIDS in South Africa and Uganda. His work highlights the significant racial and ethnic disparities in access to care, revealing the challenges faced by marginalized communities in managing complex health conditions, including the burden of long COVID and emergent resistance in tuberculosis treatments. O'Donnell employs a variety of methodologies, such as mixed-methods studies, latent class analysis, and high-throughput sequencing to improve treatment adherence among patients, particularly through innovative solutions like mHealth and electronic monitoring devices. His contributions underscore the importance of patient-centered care and the need for effective adherence support strategies for antiretrovirals and antitubercular agents. Through spatiotemporal analysis and cost-effectiveness evaluations, he aims to enhance public health strategies aimed at combating infectious diseases in tropical regions, with a particular focus on the interplay between seasonal effects and disease outbreaks such as influenza in the context of HIV and tuberculosis. Overall, O'Donnell's research integrates clinical epidemiology and public health to address complex health challenges in South Africa and Uganda, advocating for improved health outcomes for vulnerable populations.
