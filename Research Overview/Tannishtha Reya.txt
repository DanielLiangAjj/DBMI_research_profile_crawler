Researcher: Tannishtha Reya
Research Overview:
Dr. Tannishtha Reya's research focuses on the intricate biology of cancer, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its various forms, including acinar cell and adenosquamous carcinomas. Her work delves into the role of cancer stem cells, tumor microenvironments, and cell state plasticity, highlighting how these factors contribute to cancer progression, therapy resistance, and metastasis. She employs single-cell analysis, gene editing techniques, and signaling pathway investigations, such as Wnt and cytokine signaling, to unravel the complexities of tumor evolution and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. By integrating concepts from stem cell biology, like the differentiation of mammary stem cells and neural crest cells, Dr. Reya explores regenerative mechanisms and the cellular origins of cancers, aiming to develop innovative therapeutic strategies. Overall, her research significantly enhances our understanding of cancer pathology and provides potential avenues for targeted cancer therapies.
