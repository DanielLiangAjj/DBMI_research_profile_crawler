Researcher: Mijo Simunovic
Research Overview:
Mijo Simunovic's research primarily focuses on the intricate processes of embryonic development and biomechanics, with a particular emphasis on key stages such as blastulation, gastrulation, and implantation. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as mechanosignaling and mechanotransduction, Simunovic investigates the role of stem cell embryo models, including blastoids and embryoids, in unraveling the complexities of human embryo development. Central themes in the research include the mechanics of embryo attachment, symmetry breaking during early stages, and the principles of synthetic embryogenesis. Simunovic employs molecular dynamics simulations and coarse-grained modeling to explore the biomechanics of membrane dynamics, including protein scaffolding, endocytosis, and the behavior of BAR domain proteins in relation to membrane curvature and scission processes. Overall, Simunovic's work contributes significantly to our understanding of embryonic distinctions and the mechanical interactions that govern early developmental decisions, providing a foundational framework for future biomedical applications in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.
