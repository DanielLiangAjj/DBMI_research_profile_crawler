Researcher: Jean Gautier
Research Overview:
Jean Gautier's research encompasses a wide array of topics centering primarily on DNA damage and repair mechanisms, with implications in cancer biology and genomic stability. His work investigates the complexities of DNA interstrand crosslinks and double-strand breaks, focusing on the cellular responses to such damage, including homologous recombination and alternative end-joining repair pathways. Notably, he has explored the roles of proteins involved in these processes, such as CtIP and BRCA1, and their influence on chromatin architecture and nuclear organization. Beyond cancer, Gautier's research extends into the field of metabolic disorders, particularly diabetes and its complications, including diabetic retinopathy, integrating lipidomics and metabolomics to understand the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, he addresses chronic pain management in healthcare settings, emphasizing professional development and resource allocation in pain care protocols. By bridging molecular biology with practical health implications, Gautierâ€™s multifaceted research contributes significantly to the understanding of DNA repair mechanisms, cancer progression, metabolic diseases, and healthcare practices in chronic pain management.
