Researcher: Jan Claassen
Research Overview:
Jan Claassen's research primarily focuses on critical neurological conditions such as coma, traumatic brain injuries, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. His studies extensively employ advanced monitoring techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroimaging to assess brain function, consciousness disorders, and the prognosis of patients in neurocritical care environments. Claassen's work also explores factors influencing patient outcomes, including coagulation, the effects of treatment protocols, and the psychological impacts of critical illness, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. He integrates machine learning and data analytics into his research to improve prognostication and patient management strategies. Furthermore, Claassen investigates the impacts of systemic factors, including blood type and gender differences, on recovery trajectories in critically ill patients. His contributions are instrumental in enhancing our understanding of brain injury recovery processes and improving clinical care for patients experiencing debilitating neurological events.
