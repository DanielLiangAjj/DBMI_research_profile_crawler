Researcher: Sivan Kinberg
Research Overview:
Sivan Kinberg's research focuses on the critical transition of adolescents with complex medical conditions such as short bowel syndrome and intestinal failure, particularly those relying on parenteral nutrition. By addressing the unique healthcare needs of pediatric patients moving into young adulthood, Kinberg emphasizes the importance of self-management in promoting health outcomes during this vulnerable transition phase. The integration of concepts around chronic diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and strategies for effective healthcare transitions demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted challenges faced by these young individuals. Through her studies, Kinberg contributes to the advancement of pediatric gastroenterology and the development of targeted interventions that improve quality of life and health management for adolescents and young adults facing significant medical hurdles.
