Researcher: Wendy Chung
Research Overview:
Wendy Chung's research merges the fields of cardiology and genetics, focusing on the interplay between congenital heart defects and neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism and intellectual disabilities. Her work encompasses a broad spectrum of elements, including genetic variation, advanced genomic techniques such as exome and whole genome sequencing, and the ethical implications surrounding genetic testing and counseling. Chung employs innovative approaches like machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance the clinical understanding and diagnostic accuracy of rare genetic disorders. Her emphasis on social determinants of health and community engagement highlights the importance of integrating social perspectives into medical research. Moreover, her contributions extend to public health issues, particularly in the context of pandemic preparedness, underscoring the role of comprehensive health informatics. By advocating for early interventions and precision medicine strategies, her research not only addresses pressing healthcare challenges but also aims to improve the quality of care for affected individuals across various demographics.
