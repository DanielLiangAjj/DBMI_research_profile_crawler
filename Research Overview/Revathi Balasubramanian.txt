Researcher: Revathi Balasubramanian
Research Overview:
Revathi Balasubramanian's research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on retinal biology, neurogenesis, and genetic factors affecting vision. Key areas of her work include investigating the roles of various proteins and signaling pathways, such as CyclinD2, Wnt, and BMP, in the development and maintenance of retinal structures like the retinal pigment epithelium and retinal ganglion cells. She explores conditions such as albinism and glaucoma, examining the genetic predisposition and underlying mechanisms that lead to neurodegeneration and impaired visual pathways. Through advanced techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing and the development of animal models, including genetically modified mice, her studies aim to elucidate fundamental processes such as retinal development, neuronal metabolism, and neuroprotection. Balasubramanian's contributions are significant in understanding both normal and pathological states of the eye, ultimately aiming to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies for vision disorders.
