Researcher: Vincent Racaniello
Research Overview:
Vincent Racaniello's research focuses primarily on virology, emphasizing the study of various viral pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 and enteroviruses, particularly poliovirus and rhinovirus. His work explores critical themes such as pandemic preparedness, the mechanisms of viral emergence, and the implications of biosafety in viral research. Utilizing animal models, Racaniello investigates the neurotropism of enteroviruses, their biological interactions, and innate immune responses, including the roles of interferons and macrophages. Additionally, he addresses the complex relationships of viruses like the Zika virus with neurological disorders, such as cortical malformations and acute flaccid myelitis. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including in vitro and in vivo studies, he contributes to a deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis and the development of effective countermeasures against viral diseases. Overall, Racaniello's work is pivotal in advancing knowledge in virology, particularly concerning human health, emerging infectious diseases, and the strategies necessary to combat global pandemics.
