Researcher: Matthew Lebowitz
Research Overview:
Matthew Lebowitz's research primarily focuses on the intersections of psychology, genetics, and social cognition, particularly concerning mental health and disorders. His work explores concepts such as causal attribution, motivated reasoning, and stigma, shedding light on how these factors influence health beliefs, behavioral intentions, and treatment outcomes. Lebowitz emphasizes the role of genetic predispositions in understanding mental health issues like psychosis, depression, and substance use while also examining the impact of social behavior, dehumanization, and moral psychology. His interest in causal explanations extends to the study of obesity and ADHD, especially in relation to attitudes towards weight and health. Through predictive analytics and polygenic risk scoring, his research aims to integrate insights from genetics and behavioral health to inform better practices in psychiatry and health psychology. Overall, Lebowitz's work contributes significantly to our understanding of how cognitive and social dynamics shape mental health perceptions and interventions.
