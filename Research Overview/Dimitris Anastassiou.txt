Researcher: Dimitris Anastassiou
Research Overview:
Dimitris Anastassiou's research focuses on the intricate relationships between cancer genomics and the tumor microenvironment, with a particular emphasis on immuno-oncology and immune subtypes. By leveraging advanced methodologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and integrative network analysis, his work explores the complexities of tumor immunology, including the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts and other stromal cells in shaping the immune landscape of various neoplasms. His investigations encompass a wide range of malignancies, including breast, pancreatic, and lung cancers, and involve sophisticated computational biology techniques to analyze genetic heterogeneity, gene expression regulation, and disease progression. With a commitment to enhancing the understanding of tumor microenvironments and developing novel immunotherapeutic strategies, Anastassiou's contributions offer insight into personalized cancer treatment approaches and hold promise for improving patient outcomes through targeted therapies and biomarkers.
