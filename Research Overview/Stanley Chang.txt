Researcher: Stanley Chang
Research Overview:
Stanley Changâ€™s research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily centered on ocular health, surgical interventions, and innovative treatment modalities for various retinal conditions. His work includes deep investigations into lamellar macular holes, the natural history of retinal diseases, and advanced imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). He explores surgical approaches, including vitrectomy and secondary intraocular lens implantation, highlighting their outcomes in treating conditions like glaucoma, retinal detachment, and age-related macular degeneration. Furthermore, his studies delve into the translational aspects of oncology, focusing on oncolytic adenoviruses in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment and the role of genetic factors such as hTERT promotion and tumor microenvironment interactions in cancer therapy. Chang's innovative utilization of modalities like optical imaging, multimodal retinal imaging, and lab-on-a-chip technologies underscores his commitment to integrating cutting-edge methodologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy in both ophthalmic and oncological fields. Through this multifaceted approach, he aims to improve clinical outcomes, enhance understanding of disease mechanisms, and contribute to advancing tailored therapeutic strategies.
