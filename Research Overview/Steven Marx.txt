Researcher: Steven Marx
Research Overview:
Steven Marx's research primarily focuses on the roles of calcium channels, phosphorylation processes, and various therapeutic approaches in cardiology and infectious diseases, particularly hepatitis C. His work extensively studies the mechanisms by which calcium channels influence myocardial contraction and excitation-contraction coupling, which are vital for understanding and treating cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease and heart failure. He also investigates the efficacy of direct-acting antiviral agents for hepatitis C treatment, exploring real-world outcomes and compliance in treatment-na√Øve populations. Through his application of high-throughput drug screening and proteomics, he examines cellular pathways involved in arrhythmias and other cardiac conditions, while also assessing the impact of pharmacological interventions such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors and dual antiplatelet therapies. Additionally, Marx's research includes the exploration of innovative therapies like bioresorbable scaffolds and drug-eluting stents, aimed at improving treatment outcomes in coronary interventions. Collectively, his findings contribute to a better understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology and the optimization of therapeutic strategies in managing both cardiac disorders and chronic viral infections.
