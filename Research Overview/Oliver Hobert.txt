Researcher: Oliver Hobert
Research Overview:
Oliver Hobert's research primarily investigates the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying synaptic development, neuronal identity, and neurogenesis in the model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans* (C. elegans). His work encompasses various aspects of developmental biology, molecular biology, and neurobiology, with a particular focus on the roles of transcription factors, homeobox genes, and neuropeptides in shaping neural circuits and behaviors. Hobert employs various techniques including RNA-seq, whole nervous system imaging, and super-resolution microscopy to elucidate the intricacies of neuronal differentiation, connectivity, and plasticity. His studies delve into the genetic regulation of synaptic dimorphisms and sexual differentiation, linking molecular pathways to neuroanatomical and behavioral outcomes. By investigating the genetic architecture and connectomic structure of C. elegans, Hobert aims to uncover fundamental principles that govern nervous system organization and function, which may extend to broader biological contexts, including other species and disorders.
