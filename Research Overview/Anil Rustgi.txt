Researcher: Anil Rustgi
Research Overview:
Anil Rustgi's research predominantly focuses on cancer, particularly the molecular and cellular dynamics of esophageal and colorectal cancers. His work integrates cancer systems biology, investigating the role of immune responses, tumor microenvironments, and the interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts and malignant cells. Key themes include the regulatory mechanisms underpinning epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metabolism alterations, and the roles of various signaling pathways such as Wnt and Notch in tumor progression. Rustgi emphasizes the importance of transcriptomic analyses, including single-cell RNA sequencing and organoid models, to understand the heterogeneity and plasticity of tumors. Moreover, his research is directed towards advancing personalized medicine approaches, improving immune checkpoint inhibitors, and addressing challenges related to immunotherapy resistance. By leveraging insights from experimental models, clinical trials, and innovative therapeutic strategies, Rustgi's work significantly contributes to the understanding of cancer biology and the development of more effective treatments.
