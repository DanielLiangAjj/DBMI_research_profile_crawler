Researcher: Mimi Shirasu-Hiza
Research Overview:
Mimi Shirasu-Hiza's research integrates genetics, neuroscience, and developmental biology, utilizing Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans as model organisms to explore complex biological processes. Her work employs advanced techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing, GAL4/UAS for targeted gene expression, and optogenetics for manipulating neuronal activity, allowing a detailed investigation into the molecular mechanisms underpinning circadian rhythms, sleep, and oxidative stress responses. Additionally, Shirasu-Hiza examines the roles of the microbiome in influencing behavior and lifespan, linking dietary factors and metabolic pathwaysâ€”particularly the mechanisms regulated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (TOR) complexes. The breadth of her research addresses fundamental questions in cell biology, immunity, and behavior, contributing to a deeper understanding of the interactions between genetic, environmental, and cellular factors in health and longevity.
