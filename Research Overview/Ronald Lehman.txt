Researcher: Ronald Lehman
Research Overview:
Ronald Lehmanâ€™s research primarily focuses on advanced surgical techniques and outcomes related to spinal deformities, specifically in the context of adult spinal deformity (ASD), spinal fusion, and the application of robotics and electrical stimulation in spine surgery. His work investigates various factors influencing surgical outcomes, including motor evoked potentials, patient-reported outcomes, and complications associated with procedures such as anterior cervical discectomy, kyphosis correction, and scoliosis management. He emphasizes the importance of precision in surgical techniques, robotic assistance, and innovative tools like Mazor X for improving patient outcomes and minimizing complications. Additionally, his studies explore the integration of machine learning for predictive modeling of post-operative outcomes and complications, as well as the implications of spinal alignment, pelvic parameters, and deformity corrections on quality of life. Overall, Lehman's extensive contributions advance the understanding of spine surgery methodologies, patient care, and long-term health outcomes in surgical practice.
