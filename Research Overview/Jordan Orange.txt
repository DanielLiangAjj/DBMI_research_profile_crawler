Researcher: Jordan Orange
Research Overview:
Jordan Orange's research is primarily focused on the intricate field of inborn errors of immunity, particularly emphasizing the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of primary immunodeficiency diseases. His work explores the underlying mechanisms by which genetic defects, such as haploinsufficiency, affect immune function, involving assessments of natural killer (NK) cells and various immune disorders like 3M syndrome, ARTEMIS deficiency, and Hyper-IgM syndromes. By employing advanced techniques such as whole-exome sequencing and next-generation sequencing, his research aims to enhance diagnostic rates, reduce diagnostic delays, and improve patient management through decision support tools that facilitate shared decision-making and personalized treatment options like immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Additionally, he investigates the role of machine learning and clinical data science in advancing our understanding of these complexities. Orangeâ€™s contributions extend to public health aspects, aiming to raise awareness and foster education about primary immunodeficiency diseases, showcasing a comprehensive approach that combines clinical and laboratory research with community-directed initiatives. Overall, his work is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving outcomes for patients suffering from these genetic immunodeficiencies.
