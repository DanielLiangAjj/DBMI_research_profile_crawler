Researcher: Ronald Wapner
Research Overview:
Ronald Wapner's research spans a comprehensive range of topics in maternal-fetal medicine, genetics, and prenatal diagnostics. A significant portion of his work focuses on advanced genetic testing modalities such as chromosomal microarray analysis and exome sequencing, particularly as they relate to identifying fetal anomalies, diagnosing congenital conditions, and understanding genetic predispositions to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and preeclampsia. His investigations often emphasize the integration of next-generation sequencing and the use of non-invasive prenatal screening methods to enhance prenatal diagnosis. Wapner’s studies also highlight the impact of various maternal health factors—such as obesity, gestational diabetes, and socioeconomic determinants—on fetal growth, birth weight, and overall neonatal outcomes. He investigates the role of social and environmental influences, including food insecurity and access to healthcare, in shaping maternal and infant health trajectories. Moreover, through the application of advanced ultrasound technologies, including both two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging, his work aims to refine prenatal assessment protocols, improve the precision of fetal growth evaluations, and ultimately inform clinical practices that can enhance maternal and fetal health. Overall, his research contributes significantly to understanding the multifaceted interactions between genetics, maternal health, and fetal development, informing clinical practices and public health strategies aimed at improving pregnancy outcomes.
