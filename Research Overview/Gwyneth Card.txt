Researcher: Gwyneth Card
Research Overview:
Gwyneth Card's research primarily focuses on the neural circuits of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies), investigating the intricacies of connectomics, the mechanisms of sensory integration, and the underlying biology of animal behavior. Emphasizing the study of the ventral nerve cord, the research delves into the function of ascending and descending neurons, their role in motor control during flight, and the processing of visual stimuli, particularly in the context of courtship behaviors and escape reactions. The approaches used in Card's work include optogenetics, calcium imaging, and high-speed video analysis to explore the dynamic responses of neurons to sensory input. Moreover, the work contributes to a broader understanding of the neuroanatomy and functional connections that facilitate complex behaviors, integrating insights from developmental biology, neurophysiology, and computational modeling, thereby expanding our knowledge of sensory-motor integration and neural activation in response to environmental stimuli.
