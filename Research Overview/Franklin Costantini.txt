Researcher: Franklin Costantini
Research Overview:
Franklin Costantini's research centers around the development and pathology of the kidney, particularly in relation to chronic kidney disease and various forms of kidney morphogenesis. His studies employ advanced methodologies such as organ culture and the use of organoids to investigate the underlying mechanisms of kidney development. Significant themes include the role of receptor tyrosine kinases, including FGF receptor 2, and their influence on cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and gene regulation during nephric development. By utilizing genetic tools like conditional knockouts and various recombinase systems (Cre and FLP), his work elucidates the functions of essential transcription factors and proto-oncogenes, including GATA3 and multiple Eph receptors, in embryonic kidney organogenesis and disease models, including congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). Through the analysis of gene expression regulation and signaling pathways, Costantini's contributions advance our understanding of renal biology and pathology, ultimately aiming to inform strategies for treatment and prevention of kidney-related diseases.
