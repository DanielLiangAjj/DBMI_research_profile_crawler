Researcher: Andrew Chan
Research Overview:
Andrew Chan's research focuses predominantly on the intersection of spinal health, neurosurgery, and patient-reported outcomes related to various surgical interventions. His work extensively covers degenerative spinal conditions, including cervical spondylotic myelopathy and lumbar spondylolisthesis, investigating the effectiveness of both traditional and minimally invasive surgical techniques like anterior cervical discectomy, fusion, laminoplasty, and lumbar interbody fusion. Chan's research emphasizes the importance of patient-reported outcome measures, which capture the effectiveness of treatment from the patient's perspective, particularly in terms of pain alleviation, mental health, and overall quality of life. He employs machine learning and real-world evidence to analyze factors affecting surgical outcomes, including readmission and reoperation rates, thus contributing to improved strategies for management and care in neurosurgery. Additionally, Chan explores links between diet, genetics, and health risks—such as colorectal cancer—and investigates their implications for surgical populations. Overall, his multifaceted approach aims to enhance patient care in spine health through evidence-based practices and innovative methodologies.
