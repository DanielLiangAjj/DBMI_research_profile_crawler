Researcher: Casey Ta
Research Overview:
Casey Ta's research primarily focuses on the intersection of health data management, artificial intelligence, and translational science. His work emphasizes the development of interoperable data models and health standards, such as the OMOP-CDM and Phenopackets schema, to enhance phenotyping and patient recruitment in clinical trials. Ta employs advanced methodologies like machine learning and natural language processing to optimize eligibility prescreening, evidence-based medicine, and the retrieval of medical literature. His research also explores the implementation of large language models, including ChatGPT, in enhancing human-computer collaboration and knowledge representation in biomedicine. Furthermore, his studies on electronic health records (EHR) aim to improve patient selection and outcomes in real-world evidence contexts, especially in relation to diseases such as COVID-19 and various cardiovascular conditions. His efforts in team science and open data sharing are directed towards fostering a collaborative research environment that facilitates data-driven discoveries in health care and clinical research. Overall, Casey Ta's contributions aim to bridge the gap between data science, clinical application, and patient care, establishing a foundation for improved health outcomes through innovative technologies and interdisciplinary collaboration.
