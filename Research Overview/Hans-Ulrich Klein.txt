Researcher: Hans-Ulrich Klein
Research Overview:
Hans-Ulrich Klein's research focuses on the intricate relationships between mitochondrial functions, genetic predispositions, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder. His studies utilize advanced methodologies including single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics to explore the transcriptomic and proteomic landscapes associated with aging and neurodegeneration. A significant aspect of his research examines the role of psychosocial factors in cognitive resilience, highlighting the impact of environmental and genetic factors on individuals' responses to mental health conditions. Klein has also contributed to the elucidation of molecular pathways implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology, particularly concerning amyloid beta peptides, tau proteins, and the influence of mitochondrial dynamics. Overall, his extensive investigation bridges genomics, epigenomics, and neurological health, providing insights that could inform future therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative diseases.
