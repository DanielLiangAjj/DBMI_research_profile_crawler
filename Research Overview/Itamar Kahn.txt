Researcher: Itamar Kahn
Research Overview:
Itamar Kahn's research encompasses various dimensions of neuroscience, with a particular focus on neurodegenerative conditions, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and autism. By utilizing advanced imaging techniques like diffusion MRI and functional MRI, Kahn investigates the structural and functional connectivity of the brain, examining factors such as myelin sheaths, oligodendrocytes, and genetic diversity in mouse models. His work delves into brain reserve capacities and intrinsic connectivity, exploring how these elements influence cognitive functions and memory across the lifespan. Additionally, Kahn's research incorporates optogenetics and advanced modeling techniques to understand the dynamics of brain networks and neural pathways, ultimately contributing to a greater understanding of neurological disorders and the evolutionary aspects of mammalian brain function. Through this comprehensive approach, Kahn aims to elucidate the complex interplay between genetic factors, neurodevelopment, and neurodegeneration, which is critical for developing targeted interventions in pediatric and adult populations affected by these conditions.
