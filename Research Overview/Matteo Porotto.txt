Researcher: Matteo Porotto
Research Overview:
Matteo Porotto's research primarily focuses on viral pathogenesis and the mechanisms of viral fusion, particularly concerning the measles virus and other paramyxoviruses. His work investigates antiviral strategies against these viruses, exploring resistance mechanisms and the efficacy of various inhibitors, including fusion inhibitors and lipopeptides. Significant emphasis is placed on the role of viral proteins such as the fusion and spike proteins in mediating viral entry and pathogenesis. Porotto also examines the implications of viral infections in central nervous system diseases, notably subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, and how therapies like remdesivir and nitazoxanide can impact viral infections and immune responses. His research employs a range of approaches from organotypic cultures to advanced imaging techniques like cryo-electron tomography, underscoring the importance of structural analysis in understanding virus-host interactions and developing novel antiviral agents. Overall, his contributions aim to enhance our understanding of viral fusion mechanisms and inform therapeutic advancements for viral infections, including those posed by emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2.
