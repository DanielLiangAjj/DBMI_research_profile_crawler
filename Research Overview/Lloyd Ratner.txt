Researcher: Lloyd Ratner
Research Overview:
Lloyd Ratner's research primarily focuses on the intricacies of kidney transplantation and the complex factors influencing graft survival, rejection, and donor-recipient dynamics. His work explores critical themes such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), renal transplantation, donor-derived infections, and the implications of racial disparities in transplant outcomes. Ratner emphasizes the importance of both living and deceased donor kidney transplants, highlighting the role of donor selection criteria, health policy, and ethical considerations in organ allocation. His studies investigate various complications associated with renal transplants, including delayed graft function, acute rejection, and infectious diseases, especially in the context of recent challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the use of robust clinical trials, cohort studies, and systematic reviews, his research contributes significantly to understanding patient outcomes, quality of care in transplantation practices, and the optimization of the kidney donor pool. Overall, Ratner's work aims to enhance the efficacy and safety of kidney transplantation, ultimately improving patient survival and quality of life.
