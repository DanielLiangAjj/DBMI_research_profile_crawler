Researcher: Samuel Sternberg
Research Overview:
Samuel Sternberg's research centers on the development and understanding of CRISPR-Cas systems, particularly focusing on their applications in genetic engineering and genome editing. His work explores various mechanisms of RNA-guided transposition and transposase activity, particularly with transposons like Tn7 and Tn6677. Through innovative methods such as single-molecule imaging and SMRT-seq, Sternberg investigates the kinetics of DNA transposition, CRISPR-Cas9 functionality, and structural characterization using cryoelectron microscopy. His significant contributions also extend to the study of molecular biophysics related to substrate specificity, integration host factors, and the evolution of these systems across bacterial genomes. Overall, Sternberg's extensive research not only advances the understanding of CRISPR and transposon technologies but also contributes to the broader field of genetic modification and targeted gene repair methodologies.
