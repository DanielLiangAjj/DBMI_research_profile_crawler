Researcher: Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele
Research Overview:
Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele's research primarily focuses on understanding neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), through various lenses including genetic, biochemical, and behavioral approaches. His work extensively investigates the roles of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, utilizing techniques like chemogenetics and in vivo electrophysiology to explore their contributions to motor and social behaviors as well as stereotypic and repetitive actions often observed in ASD and related disorders. Additionally, Veenstra-VanderWeele examines genetic factors associated with chromosomal abnormalities, such as DNA copy number variations impacting conditions like 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, and how these genetic markers correlate with distinct phenotypes in neurodevelopmental contexts. His research also addresses the implications of psychotropic medications on treatment outcomes in children and adolescents with ASD, especially investigating biomarkers that can predict response to therapies. Furthermore, the impact of environmental factors like COVID-19 on neurodevelopmental outcomes is also a pertinent area of study. Through a multifaceted approach combining animal models, clinical trials, and genetic analyses, Veenstra-VanderWeele's work contributes significant insights into the atypical neurodevelopmental trajectories seen in autism and associated psychiatric disorders, ultimately aiming to improve diagnostic methods and personalized interventions.
