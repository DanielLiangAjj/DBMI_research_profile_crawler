Researcher: Arthur Palmer III
Research Overview:
Arthur Palmer III's research primarily focuses on the dynamics and kinetics of biomolecules, particularly proteins and nucleic acids, employing advanced techniques in NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. His work emphasizes the exploration of methyl dynamics, barrier crossing dynamics, and chemical exchange processes, with a strong emphasis on model-free formulations and spectral density mapping. Palmer's studies encompass critical aspects of protein dynamics and interactions, including binding mechanisms and conformational changes in protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid complexes, often using structures derived from cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, his research investigates the catalytic efficiency and mechanism of enzymes, as well as the kinetics of small molecules and their interactions in the biochemical landscape. Through integrating high-pressure NMR and relaxation dispersion methods, Palmer aims to uncover fundamental insights into molecular behavior, with applications in elucidating the roles of cadherins in cell adhesion, RNA dynamics, and enzyme functionality, contributing significantly to structural biology and chemical kinetics.
