Researcher: Ana Emiliano
Research Overview:
Ana Emiliano's research focuses on the metabolic roles of brown adipose tissue in relation to energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis, particularly in the context of obesity and bariatric surgery. Her studies explore the physiological implications of dietary interventions and the hormone leptin in metabolic adaptation, addressing both human and animal models. Employing a clinical physiology perspective, Emiliano investigates the effects of various surgical procedures, such as gastrectomy and gastric bypass, on weight loss and post-operative complications, utilizing qualitative and comparative effectiveness research methodologies. Her work underscores the significance of patient-centered care and the influence of factors like gender and age on obesity-related health outcomes, deepening the understanding of metabolic dynamics and potential therapeutic strategies. Through these investigations, she contributes valuable insights into the intersection of metabolic health, surgical interventions, and lifestyle factors in managing obesity and related metabolic disorders.
