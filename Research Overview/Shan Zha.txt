Researcher: Shan Zha
Research Overview:
Shan Zha's research primarily focuses on the mechanisms of DNA damage response and repair, particularly in the context of PARP proteins, including PARP1 and PARP2, and their role in maintaining genomic stability. Key investigations involve live-cell quantitative imaging to explore interactions and modifications involved in DNA repair processes such as non-homologous end joining, homologous recombination, and DNA damage signaling pathways, including the roles of ATM and ATR kinases. Additionally, Zha's work extends to understanding the implications of these processes in aging, metabolic dysfunction, and cancer, particularly through the modulation of pathways associated with poly(ADP-ribosylation) and the response to genotoxic stress. Other significant aspects of the research involve the exploration of BAR domain proteins and the effects of mutations associated with familial breast cancer, suggesting a critical intersection between DNA repair mechanisms and tumorigenesis. Overall, Zha's contributions elucidate fundamental aspects of cellular mechanisms that uphold genomic integrity across various biological contexts.
