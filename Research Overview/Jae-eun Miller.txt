Researcher: Jae-eun Miller
Research Overview:
Jae-eun Miller's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of sensory processing in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice, utilizing advanced techniques such as in vivo calcium imaging and two-photon microscopy. The primary themes of the research include exploring intrinsic neuronal activity, ongoing activity patterns, and how these relate to perceptual learning and visual memory. By employing graph theory and analyzing multidimensional population vectors, Miller examines the dynamics of neuronal ensembles and their role in visual recognition tasks. Additionally, the research delves into the interplay between circadian rhythms and sensory discrimination, particularly in olfactory contexts, highlighting the complex interactions within the nervous system. Overall, Miller's work contributes to our understanding of how neural mechanisms underpin perceptual experiences and learning, advancing knowledge in the fields of neuroscience and cognitive functions.
