Researcher: David D. Ho
Research Overview:
David D. Ho's extensive research focuses on the immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, particularly within the context of COVID-19. Key themes include antibody evasion, the evolution of virus variants, neutralization mechanisms, and vaccine responses, particularly with mRNA vaccines and their effectiveness against various strains, such as Omicron subvariants. His work also delves into the roles of neutralizing antibodies, drug resistance, potential antiviral agents, and the serological testing landscape, emphasizing the implications for public health and therapeutic strategies. Utilizing advanced techniques, such as cryoelectron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, Ho's studies support a deeper understanding of the virus's receptor engagement and immune evasion tactics. His findings significantly contribute to the ongoing global efforts to combat COVID-19 by enhancing vaccine efficacy and tailoring antiviral drug development. Overall, Ho's research underscores the dynamic interplay between virus evolution and host immunity, shaping strategies for effective pandemic response.
