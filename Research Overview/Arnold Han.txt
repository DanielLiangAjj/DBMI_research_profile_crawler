Researcher: Arnold Han
Research Overview:
Arnold Han's research encompasses a wide range of topics primarily focused on the biology of the immune system, intestinal health, and cancer immunotherapy. His studies investigate critical aspects of intestinal epithelium and the roles of various cell types including intestinal stem cells, crypt base columnar cells, and B and T lymphocytes in both healthy and diseased states such as celiac disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). He employs advanced methodologies such as time-resolved fate mapping, single-cell sequencing, and high-throughput T cell receptor sequencing to explore lineage hierarchies and immune responses in the context of inflammation and autoimmunity. Additionally, his work delves into cancer immunology, focusing on colorectal cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer, emphasizing immune checkpoint blockade and the intricacies of T cell repertoire fitness and antigen specificity. Overall, Hanâ€™s research significantly contributes to our understanding of mucosal immunity, tissue regeneration, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies in immunology and oncology.
