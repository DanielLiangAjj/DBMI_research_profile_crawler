Researcher: Jonathan Dworkin
Research Overview:
Jonathan Dworkin's research focuses on the interplay between protein synthesis, cellular dormancy, and microbial physiology, particularly within the context of bacterial responses to nutrient limitations and environmental stresses. His work extensively investigates the role of elongation factor P (EF-P) in translational regulation and ribosome quality control during growth arrest and quiescence in bacteria like *Bacillus subtilis* and *Escherichia coli*. Dworkin also explores how signaling molecules such as (p)ppGpp mediate the stringent response to starvation and contribute to phenotypic variation in microbial populations. In addition to fundamental biological processes, his studies delve into clinical aspects such as the implications of bacterial infections, particularly in relation to the incidence of endocarditis and the burden of antibiotic resistance. Collectively, Dworkin's contributions provide insights into microbial adaptation strategies, the mechanisms governing sporulation, and the potential clinical ramifications of bacterial behavior under stress conditions.
