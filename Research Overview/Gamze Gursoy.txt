Researcher: Gamze Gursoy
Research Overview:
Gamze Gursoy's research integrates diverse fields such as genomics, machine learning, and privacy-enhancing technologies to explore complex biological systems and improve health outcomes. Her work emphasizes geno-phenotype associations, particularly in relation to mental health issues like suicide and physical health conditions such as stroke, hereditary angioedema, and opportunistic infections in renal transplant recipients. Gursoy employs advanced methodologies including multiomics approaches, RNA-seq, and machine learning algorithms to uncover allele-specific activities and functional genomic interactions, while also prioritizing genetic privacy and data security through tools like blockchain and homomorphic encryption. She addresses the implications of genomic data sharing and privacy, ensuring that while advancing personalized medicine and predictive models, patient confidentiality and ethical data practices remain paramount. Her comprehensive investigations into the human genome not only shed light on the genetic underpinnings of diseases but also pave the way for innovative solutions in healthcare delivery and precision medicine.
