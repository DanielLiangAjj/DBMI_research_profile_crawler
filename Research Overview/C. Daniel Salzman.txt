Researcher: C. Daniel Salzman
Research Overview:
C. Daniel Salzman's research broadly investigates the neural mechanisms underpinning emotion, attention, and learning, particularly focusing on the amygdala and its interactions with various brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and hippocampus. His work examines how interneurons contribute to processing both threat and non-threat stimuli, employing advanced techniques such as optogenetics and brain mapping to elucidate neural dynamics. By studying neural circuits and employing computational models, including artificial neural networks and factorized representations, Salzman explores the underlying abstractions of behavior and perception in both human and nonhuman primates. His findings delve into the complexities of reward-based learning, attention, and cognitive processing, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the neural basis of decision-making and emotional regulation.
