Researcher: Yiyi Ma
Research Overview:
Yiyi Ma's research focuses on the complex pathology of Alzheimer's disease through integrative multi-omics approaches, including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. By utilizing techniques such as whole genome sequencing and genome-wide association studies, the studies delve into the genetic and epigenetic factors influencing the disease, such as DNA methylation and the role of apolipoprotein E (APOE) variations. The research also explores the contributions of various cell types, including microglia and astrocytes, to brain health and cognitive function, addressing mechanisms like insulin resistance and cognitive resilience. Furthermore, the findings emphasize the importance of episodic memory trajectories, rare and common genetic variations, and the significance of cell-type specific expression quantitatively assessed through eQTL and sQTL analyses. Overall, Yiyi Ma's work advances our understanding of Alzheimer's disease by illuminating the interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental context, and cellular mechanisms in the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders, thereby contributing to the development of precision medicine strategies.
