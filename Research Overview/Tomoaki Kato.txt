Researcher: Tomoaki Kato
Research Overview:
Tomoaki Kato's research primarily focuses on advancements in transplant immunology, especially in the context of various organ transplantations, including liver, intestine, and spleen. His work emphasizes understanding acute cellular and antibody-mediated rejections, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and the role of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and memory T cells in transplant tolerance and graft survival. By exploring dynamic reconstitution and the impact of immunosuppressive therapies, Kato investigates patient outcomes in pediatric and adult transplant populations. His studies also extend to the surgical techniques and complications associated with multivisceral and living donor liver transplantations, analyzing factors that influence patient and graft survival rates. Additionally, Kato's research incorporates the intersections of transplantation with cancer biology, investigating the implications of soft-tissue tumors and responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors in transplant recipients. Ultimately, Kato's research contributes to the enhancement of transplant methodologies and patient care, aiming to improve outcomes in organ transplantation and address the challenges surrounding graft acceptance and immune response.
