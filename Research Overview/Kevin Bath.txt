Researcher: Kevin Bath
Research Overview:
Kevin Bath's research primarily focuses on the interplay between early life adversity, stress responses, and neurodevelopmental outcomes, particularly related to psychiatric conditions. His work investigates how early experiences, including trauma and adversity, influence behavioral and neurobiological processes throughout development, leading to variations in emotional regulation, anxiety, and resilience among different sexes. Utilizing rodent models, he examines mechanisms involving corticosterone, neurogenesis, and the associated changes in brain structures such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Additionally, his research explores the impact of factors like maternal behavior, social interaction, and environmental stressors on neurodevelopmental trajectories, shedding light on the vulnerability and resilience to psychiatric disorders, particularly in the context of conditions such as ADHD, depression, and autism spectrum disorders. Kevin Bath's investigations contribute valuable insights into the biological and psychosocial frameworks underlying mental health, emphasizing the critical role of early life experiences in shaping emotional and cognitive outcomes.
