Researcher: Luke E. Berchowitz
Research Overview:
Luke E. Berchowitz's research focuses on the intricate roles of RNA-binding proteins and amyloid-like assemblies in cellular processes, particularly in the context of meiosis and gametogenesis. His work delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying nutrient signaling, protein translation, and the regulation of gene expression, emphasizing the functional significance of protein aggregates and homeostasis. Utilizing *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* as a model organism, Berchowitz investigates key players such as 14-3-3 proteins, Polo kinase, cyclins, and various transcriptional regulators, linking their activities to cellular processes like meiosis, chromosome segregation, and DNA replication. His studies also explore the intersections of these protein interactions with neurodegeneration and cancer, particularly colorectal cancer driven by the bacteria *Fusobacterium nucleatum*. Overall, Berchowitz's research offers compelling insights into the dynamic nature of RNA-binding proteins and their implications in both developmental biology and disease contexts.
