Researcher: Chuchun Chang
Research Overview:
Chuchun Chang's research primarily focuses on the roles of omega-3 fatty acids and lipid metabolism in various health conditions, with particular emphasis on cardiac and inflammatory diseases. The studies explore acute and chronic treatment modalities related to myocardial infarction, stroke, and spinal cord and brain injuries. Key areas of investigation include the effects of dietary fat sources, such as fish oil and soy oil emulsions, on triglyceride levels, lipoprotein lipase activity, and the interplay of immune cells like macrophages and monocytes within the context of atherosclerosis and obesity. Additionally, the research delves into the kinetics of fatty acid absorption and organ uptake, as well as the implications for hematopoiesis and leukocytosis in response to high-fat diets and inflammation. Overall, Chang's work significantly contributes to understanding the biochemical pathways and cellular mechanisms underpinning cardiovascular health, obesity, and related metabolic disorders, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies centered around dietary interventions.
