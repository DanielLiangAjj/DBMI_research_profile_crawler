Researcher: Hulya Bayir
Research Overview:
Dr. Hulya Bayir's research encompasses a diverse spectrum of topics primarily centered around the mechanisms of cell death and neurodegeneration, with a particular focus on ferroptosis, lipid peroxidation, and the roles of iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in various disease models. Through the investigation of processes such as ferritinophagy, lipophagy, and the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction, her work sheds light on the biochemical pathways contributing to conditions like cancer, traumatic brain injury, and rare diseases. Employing techniques like mass spectrometry and redox lipidomics, Dr. Bayir explores the tumor microenvironment, neuroinflammation, and the implications of lipid signals in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Her studies aim to elucidate the interplay between autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis, enhancing our understanding of regulated cell death mechanisms in pediatric and adult populations. By integrating insights from animal models, her research contributes to the design of potential therapeutic interventions targeting neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, emphasizing the importance of lipid metabolism, mitochondria health, and oxidative stress in promoting cellular resilience. Ultimately, Dr. Bayir's work not only advances scientific knowledge but also has the potential to inform clinical approaches in critical care and rehabilitation settings.
