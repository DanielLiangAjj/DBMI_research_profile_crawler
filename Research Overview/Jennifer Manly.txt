Researcher: Jennifer Manly
Research Overview:
Jennifer Manly's research encompasses a comprehensive examination of cognitive health, particularly in relation to dementia and cardiovascular diseases, emphasizing the intersections of socioeconomic status, race, and health disparities. Her extensive investigation into risk factors for dementia includes analysis of blood pressure, biomarkers such as Apolipoprotein E4 and tau proteins, and the impact of chronic conditions like diabetes and depression on cognitive function across various populations, particularly among older adults. Additionally, Manly explores the influence of environmental factors, including air pollution, as well as lifestyle interventions such as physical activity and dietary patterns, on cognitive aging and dementia risk. Through the use of longitudinal studies and diverse cohort analyses, her work highlights structural racism and socioeconomic inequities as significant determinants of cognitive decline and health outcomes in aging populations. Overall, Manly's research aims to enhance understanding of the multifactorial nature of dementia and promote health equity through targeted prevention and intervention strategies in vulnerable communities.
