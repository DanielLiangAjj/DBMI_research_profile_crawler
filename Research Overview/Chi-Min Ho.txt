Researcher: Chi-Min Ho
Research Overview:
Chi-Min Ho's research primarily focuses on the intersection of malaria parasitology and advanced imaging techniques, specifically cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryoET). The work centers on the structural analysis of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, with an emphasis on endogenous structure determination and structural proteomics. Through the exploration of protein conformation and biological transport mechanisms in erythrocytes, Ho investigates host-parasite interactions and the trafficking of protozoan proteins within cellular environments. Additionally, the research is aimed at understanding the implications of these processes in malaria pathology and developing strategies for effective interventions against the disease. This comprehensive approach highlights the integral role that cutting-edge imaging methods play in advancing our understanding of malaria at the molecular level.
