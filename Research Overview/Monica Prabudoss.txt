Researcher: Monica Prabudoss
Research Overview:
Monica Prabudoss's research encompasses a diverse array of topics within the fields of oncology, public health, and healthcare systems, focusing on both clinical implications and implementation science. Key areas of her interest include gene therapy for cancers such as breast and pancreatic cancers, as well as the application of innovative cancer treatments like CAR T-cell therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Her work also addresses public health challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, emphasizing the importance of social determinants of health, access to care, and tailored interventions for HIV patients and vulnerable populations. Additionally, Prabudoss has contributed to the discourse on healthcare disparities, mental health, and the integration of artificial intelligence in medical practice. Her comprehensive approach combines clinical research methods with qualitative studies to optimize patient care, improve health outcomes, and promote evidence-based practices across diverse healthcare settings. Ultimately, Prabudoss aims to bridge the gap between laboratory research and real-world healthcare applications, advocating for reforms that enhance patient experience, accessibility, and disease management in various populations.
