Researcher: Delivette Castor
Research Overview:
Delivette Castor's research focuses on pivotal public health strategies aimed at addressing the HIV epidemic, particularly through the lens of HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (HIV PrEP), implementation science, and health equity. Through an extensive exploration of provider feedback mechanisms, sexual health education, and disparities in healthcare access, Castor emphasizes the importance of context-specific interventions within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and marginalized populations, including adolescent girls, young women, and LGBTQ+ communities. The integration of innovative approaches such as digital health, machine learning, and cost-effectiveness analyses further underpins the exploration of prevention strategies, viral management, and retention in care. Additionally, the influence of comorbidities like COVID-19 and mental health issues on healthcare behaviors and outcomes is examined, affirming the necessity of comprehensive models in tackling infectious diseases. Overall, Castorâ€™s body of work is instrumental in shaping health policy and enhancing the efficacy of HIV prevention frameworks, thereby contributing to initiatives aimed at ending the HIV epidemic and promoting health equity globally.
