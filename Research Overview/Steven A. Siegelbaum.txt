Researcher: Steven A. Siegelbaum
Research Overview:
Steven A. Siegelbaumâ€™s research focuses on intricate aspects of hippocampal function, particularly in the context of memory and learning. His work involves investigating the roles of various regions within the hippocampus, specifically the CA1 and CA2 areas, in processes such as social recognition, novelty detection, and contextual memory formation. Siegelbaum employs a range of advanced techniques, including optogenetics, calcium imaging, and electrophysiology, to elucidate the underlying synaptic mechanisms and neuronal excitability that contribute to hippocampal plasticity and behavior. His studies also explore the implications of NMDA receptors, cholecystokinin, and parvalbumin in the modulation of inhibitory-excitatory balance, which is crucial for maintaining cognitive functions and preventing pathological conditions like epilepsy. Through his comprehensive approach, Siegelbaum aims to deepen the understanding of how neural circuits and molecular interactions influence memory processes and behavioral responses in both healthy and diseased states.
