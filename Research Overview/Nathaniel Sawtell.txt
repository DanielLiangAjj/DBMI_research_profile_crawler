Researcher: Nathaniel Sawtell
Research Overview:
Nathaniel Sawtell's research primarily investigates the intricate relationships between sensory processing, motor control, and learning through the lens of neuroethology and computational neuroscience, with a focus on electric fish as a model system. His work explores phenomena such as corollary discharge, synaptic plasticity, and internal models that underpin decision-making, proprioception, and the flexibility of neural networks in both electric fish and mice. By employing advanced techniques such as electrode arrays and neurophysiological stimulation, Sawtellâ€™s studies elucidate how the cerebellum and other neural circuits contribute to locomotion and sensory feedback. His findings enhance our understanding of dendritic spikes and temporal coding in neurons, signaling the importance of these mechanisms across various species. Overall, Sawtell's research significantly contributes to the field of neuroscience by uncovering the biological bases of perception and behavior, and by advancing the knowledge of how neural structures adapt and learn from experiences.
