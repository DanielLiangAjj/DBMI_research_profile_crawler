Researcher: Steven L. Reiner
Research Overview:
Steven L. Reiner's research focuses extensively on the immunological mechanisms underlying T cell differentiation, functionality, and memory, particularly regarding CD8(+) T cells. His studies delve into the regulation of immune checkpoints such as PD-1 and PDL1 and their roles in cancer immunotherapy, exploring topics such as resistance to immune checkpoint blockade and cancer immune evasion. Reiner employs advanced techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9 screenings to investigate asymmetric cell division and metabolic pathways that underpin self-renewal in T cells and stem cells. His work also addresses the interplay between the tumor microenvironment and immune responses, encompassing the impact of metabolic syndrome and microbiota on immunity, particularly in models of autoimmunity and cancer. Furthermore, he examines the contribution of various transcription factors, including TCF1 and Pax5, to T cell lineage commitment and differentiation. Overall, Reiner's research significantly enhances the understanding of adaptive immunity and the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies against cancer and autoimmune diseases.
