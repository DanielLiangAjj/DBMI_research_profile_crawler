Researcher: Nikhil Sharma
Research Overview:
Nikhil Sharma's research spans a diverse array of topics within the fields of neurosurgery, cardiology, and infectious diseases, emphasizing innovative approaches such as augmented and virtual reality in surgical education and practice. His studies on interferon signaling, particularly with the gene IFIT2, highlight its role in immune response to neurotropic viruses and cancer, linking neurology with immunotherapy for conditions like glioblastoma and other gliomas. Notably, Sharma has also contributed to understanding pregnancy-related health issues, specifically through investigations of supraventricular tachycardia management during and after cesarean sections. His interests extend to the implications of COVID-19 on various health sectors, involving the exploration of biomarkers, vaccination responses, and the viral genome's mutation rates. Additionally, his work integrates advanced technologies such as machine learning and 3D imaging, enhancing surgical outcomes and patient care. By converging surgical innovation, patient-centered research, and the biological understanding of diseases, Sharma's contributions significantly advance the fields of neurology, cardiology, and public health through both clinical and translational research.
