Researcher: Jacqueline Gottlieb
Research Overview:
Jacqueline Gottlieb's research primarily revolves around the intricate relationship between cognitive processes, attention, decision-making, and learning, with a strong emphasis on how these elements are influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Utilizing a combination of human neuroimaging and animal models, particularly monkeys, her work explores concepts such as reinforcement learning, information-seeking behaviors, and the neurological underpinnings of perception and action, including eye movements and saccadic responses. Key themes include the exploration of factors like curiosity, effort, and uncertainty in decision-making, alongside the neural mechanisms within critical brain regions such as the prefrontal and parietal lobes. Gottliebâ€™s studies often employ advanced computational techniques, including machine learning and data mining, to unravel the complexities of how organisms navigate their environments and make choices based on learned information, reward features, and attentional dynamics. Through this multidisciplinary approach, her research contributes significantly to our understanding of cognitive functions across species, emphasizing the role of motivation and salience in guiding behavior.
