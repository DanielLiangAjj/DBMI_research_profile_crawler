Researcher: Jennifer Small Saunders
Research Overview:
Jennifer Small Saunders' research focuses primarily on the evolution of drug resistance in *Plasmodium falciparum*, the protozoan parasite responsible for malaria. Her investigations shed light on critical mechanisms such as PfCRT mutations that contribute to the development of antimalarial drug resistance, particularly in the context of artemisinin-based combination therapies and piperaquine resistance. In addition to malaria research, Saunders has also explored health-related topics surrounding COVID-19, including its gastrointestinal symptoms and implications for individuals with comorbidities like obesity. Her work employs various methodologies, including genomic and proteomic analyses, to connect evolutionary fitness with the emergence of antibiotic resistance in both malaria and bacterial infections. By integrating findings across different health challenges, her research addresses significant public health concerns, emphasizing the need for an adaptive approach to combating infectious diseases.
