Researcher: Teresa Palomero Vazquez
Research Overview:
Teresa Palomero Vazquez's research focuses on the interplay between tumor biology and therapeutic strategies for T-cell lymphomas, particularly cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Utilizing preclinical models, her work explores combination therapies involving agents like romidepsin and various chemotherapeutics. She investigates genetic factors, such as mutations in genes like TET2, GATA3, and RHOA G17V, as well as gene fusions, and their implications for T-cell differentiation and chemotherapy resistance. Her studies also emphasize the tumor microenvironment, including the roles of tumor-associated macrophages and T follicular helper cells, which contribute to the pathophysiology and treatment resistance observed in these malignancies. By leveraging advanced genomic techniques, such as whole-exome sequencing, her research aims to identify biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets, ultimately enhancing the efficacy of treatments and addressing recurrence in conditions like acute lymphoblastic leukemia and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Through her work, Vazquez contributes significantly to understanding the complexities of T-cell lymphomas and developing more effective therapeutic strategies.
