Researcher: David Ho
Research Overview:
David Ho's research primarily focuses on the intricate dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, particularly its diverse variants and implications for COVID-19 immunity and vaccine efficacy. His work extensively investigates the mechanisms of antibody evasion, highlighting the roles of various subvariants such as BA.2.87.1, EG.5.1, and the impact of mRNA vaccines. Through advanced techniques like cryoelectron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, he explores receptor engagement strategies, the neutralization potency of antibodies, and adaptations in viral infectivity due to convergent evolution. His studies also address the complex nature of immunity, including antibody-mediated trans-infection and the kinetics of immune responses following vaccinations or infections. Moreover, he examines therapeutic options such as small-molecule inhibitors, highlighting Nirmatrelvir as a key protease inhibitor in the fight against COVID-19. Overall, Ho's research contributes significantly to understanding the evolving landscape of viral pathogens and designing effective intervention strategies for managing COVID-19 and its variants.
