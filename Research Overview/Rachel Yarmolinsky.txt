Researcher: Rachel Yarmolinsky
Research Overview:
Rachel Yarmolinsky’s research centers on the intersection of ethics and genetics, emphasizing themes of equity, justice, and the ethical implications of genomic advancements. Through her exploration of biases that affect genetic research and its applications, she examines how ELSI (Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications) frameworks can foster fairness in genomic practices. By engaging with concepts in bioethics and the role of ethics committees, she critiques existing codes of ethics while advocating for more inclusive practices that address the diverse needs of societies, particularly in the context of the United States. Yarmolinsky’s work underscores the necessity of integrating ethical considerations into genomics to promote a just and equitable approach to human health.
