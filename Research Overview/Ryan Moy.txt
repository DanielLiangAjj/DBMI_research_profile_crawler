Researcher: Ryan Moy
Research Overview:
Ryan Moy's research primarily focuses on the advancement of therapeutic strategies and understanding the underlying mechanisms in gastric and esophagogastric cancers. His investigations encompass a wide array of topics including adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies, immunotherapy, and novel targeted therapies that leverage biomarkers and patient-derived organoids. Special attention is given to overcoming chemoresistance and improving treatment outcomes through the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T and CAR NK cells, and antibody-drug conjugates. In addition, his work delves into the intricacies of the tumor microenvironment, highlighting the roles of various proteins such as ITPR3 and RELB, as well as signaling pathways pertinent to angiogenesis and metastasis. His exploration extends beyond cancer therapy into antiviral mechanisms, examining the roles of DEAD-box helicases and RNA interference in the context of RNA viruses. Overall, Moy's multidimensional approach seeks not only to enhance therapeutic efficacy in gastric and esophageal cancers but also to contribute to the broader understanding of host-pathogen interactions and immune responses.
