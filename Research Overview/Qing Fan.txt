Researcher: Qing Fan
Research Overview:
Qing Fan's research encompasses a wide array of topics within health and biological sciences, highlighting significant intersections between obesity, metabolic disorders, cancer therapy, mental health, and viral infections. A recurrent theme in Fan's work is the investigation of brown adipose tissue and the complex interactions between metabolic pathways and immune responses, particularly in the context of obesity and its phenotypes. The researcher explores innovative treatment modalities such as metabolic and bariatric surgery, therapeutic interventions like mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and advancement in cancer-targeting therapies, which include novel applications of photothermal-immunotherapy and the utilization of nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery. Furthermore, Fan's work investigates the immunological aspects of viral diseases, particularly those related to SARS-CoV-2, with a focus on vaccine responses and neutralizing antibodies. Other areas of inquiry include the characterization of various viral pathogens affecting avian species, harnessing bioinformatics for cancer studies, and translational applications in public health. Overall, Fanâ€™s comprehensive research aims to integrate findings across disciplines to advance therapeutic strategies and improve health outcomes in diverse populations.
