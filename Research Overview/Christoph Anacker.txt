Researcher: Christoph Anacker
Research Overview:
Christoph Anacker's research focuses on the neurobiological underpinnings of stress, depression, and resilience, particularly in the context of the hippo-campal circuitry and its interactions with various neurotransmitter systems, including serotonergic and opioid pathways. His work examines the impact of prenatal and chronic stress on neurogenesis and epigenetic modifications, as reflected in DNA methylation and gene expression changes. Anacker's studies employ advanced imaging techniques like MRI and DTI to explore structural and functional alterations in key brain regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and cingulate cortex, as they relate to psychological resilience and vulnerability. He also investigates the roles of antipsychotic medications, such as fluoxetine, and their effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and neuroplasticity. His findings underscore the significance of maternal care and sex differences in stress response and susceptibility to depressive disorders, highlighting the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and biochemical factors in mental health outcomes. Overall, Anacker's research contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of stress-related psychopathologies and the potential for targeted interventions in treating depression and improving resilience.
