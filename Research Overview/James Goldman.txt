Researcher: James Goldman
Research Overview:
James Goldman's research encompasses a broad range of topics primarily focused on neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular emphasis on frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer’s disease, and the role of neuroinflammation in various neurological disorders. His work integrates cutting-edge techniques, such as single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to model diseases and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Key highlights of his research include the study of tau proteins, osteopontin (Spp1), and the implications of genetic mutations—especially the MAPT N279K mutation—on the pathophysiology of FTD and associated neuroinflammatory processes. Additionally, Goldman explores the impact of environmental factors like hypoxia as well as the interplay between microglia and astrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases. His investigations into the mechanistic links between neuroinflammation, neuronal pathology, and genetic predispositions offer valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets and the broader implications for diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease, particularly in the context of rising concerns related to COVID-19 and its neurological sequelae. Through his interdisciplinary approach, Goldman significantly contributes to the understanding of neurodegeneration, disease modeling, and the role of cellular interactions in maintaining brain health.
