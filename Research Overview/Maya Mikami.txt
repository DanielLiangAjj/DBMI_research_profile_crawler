Researcher: Maya Mikami
Research Overview:
Maya Mikami's research encompasses a range of topics primarily oriented around the interactions of pharmacological agents, particularly anesthetics like propofol and sevoflurane, with neuropsychological outcomes and respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic allergic lung inflammation. Her studies utilize electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and patient state indices to better understand emergence agitation and its implications during anesthesia. Additionally, Mikami explores cellular mechanisms underlying inflammation and airway management, focusing on mast cells, cytokines, and their roles in neurobehavior and memory functions. Her research employs various animal models, including inbred mice, to investigate the therapeutic potentials of smoothing muscle relaxation and bronchodilation in conditions exacerbated by allergens like house dust mite. Notably, she examines the signaling pathways involving cAMP, regulatory T cells, and osteoclast activity, revealing insights into cell stiffness, inflammation, and the broader physiological impacts of her findings. Overall, her work significantly contributes to the fields of anesthesiology, immunology, and neurobehavior, highlighting the intricate relationships between anesthetic agents, immune responses, and memory processes.
