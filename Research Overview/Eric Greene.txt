Researcher: Eric Greene
Research Overview:
Eric Greene's research focuses on the complex mechanisms of DNA repair and homologous recombination, particularly through the investigation of helicases, recombinases, and DNA-binding proteins within single-molecule contexts. Utilizing advanced techniques like single-molecule fluorescence, DNA curtains, and various microscopy methods (e.g., cryoelectron microscopy), Greene explores the roles of key proteins such as Rad51, Rad54, and Srs2 in maintaining genome integrity and facilitating DNA repair processes. His work delves into the mechanics of DNA translocation, interaction dynamics, and the structural biology of protein complexes involved in nucleotide synthesis and repair pathways. Through his studies, Greene aims to elucidate the underlying principles of DNA damage response and the interplay between various recombination pathways, including homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, enhancing our understanding of genomic stability in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. This multifaceted approach not only advances fundamental molecular biology but also has implications for insights into genetic repair mechanisms in diseases such as cancer.
