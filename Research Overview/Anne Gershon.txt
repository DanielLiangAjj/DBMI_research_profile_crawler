Researcher: Anne Gershon
Research Overview:
Anne Gershon's research extensively focuses on the interplay between viral infections, particularly Herpes Zoster (HZ) and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Her work encompasses various aspects of vaccinology, investigating the role of vaccines, including the varicella vaccine and shingles vaccine, in both pediatric and adult populations. Her studies have delved into the mechanisms of virus latency and reactivation, notably in immunocompromised individuals, and the association of these infections with neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and postherpetic neuralgia. Gershon has employed a range of methodologies, including advanced viral serology techniques and high-throughput genotyping, to explore viral dynamics, clinical efficacy, and safety profiles of antiviral therapies like valacyclovir and acyclovir. Her contributions underscore the importance of vaccination in mitigating complications from viral infections and highlight risks associated with breakthrough infections in various populations. Overall, Gershon's research significantly enhances the understanding of VZV pathogenesis, vaccination strategies, and the broader implications for public health in the context of ongoing global health challenges.
