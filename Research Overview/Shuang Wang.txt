Researcher: Shuang Wang
Research Overview:
Shuang Wang's research interests encompass a broad spectrum of topics primarily focused on cancer biology, healthcare practices, and microbiome studies. Central to their work is the investigation of signaling pathways involved in tumor progression and immune response, particularly emphasizing the roles of transmembrane proteins like Epithelial Membrane Protein 3 and various factors within the tumor microenvironment. Wang has explored various aspects of glioma and other cancers, linking histone variants and gene rearrangement to drug resistance and therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, Wang's work delves into pharmacology, assessing the implications of drug interactions and prescribing practices in diverse healthcare settings. They have made contributions in the field of microbiomics, focusing on gut microbiota's role in diseases such as diabetes and its association with metabolic dysfunction. Techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9, meta-analysis, and advanced imaging methodologies like Raman spectroscopy and single-cell RNA sequencing are frequently employed in their studies to elucidate complex biological interactions. Wangâ€™s notable investigations also incorporate the effects of environmental factors and dietary constituents on health outcomes, particularly in the context of chronic diseases and aging. Overall, their research significantly bridges molecular biology, clinical implications, and environmental health, contributing valuable insights into the prevention and treatment of various diseases.
