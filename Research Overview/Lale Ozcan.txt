Researcher: Lale Ozcan
Research Overview:
Lale Ozcan's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationships between lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, emphasizing the role of key proteins such as PCSK9, Rap1a, and various signal transduction pathways involved in metabolic regulation. The studies explore how modulating cholesterol levels through interventions like statins, and the impact of adipo-inflammatory responses in obesity, influence conditions such as atherosclerosis and hyperglycemia. Furthermore, the research examines the interplay of glucagon, hepatic glucose production, and gluconeogenesis, alongside the metabolic effects of geranylgeranylation, revealing insights into the molecular mechanisms of metabolic diseases. By utilizing a range of model organisms—including human, mouse, and zebrafish—Ozcan's work contributes significantly to understanding the cellular and molecular basis of cholesterol and glucose homeostasis, ultimately aiming to identify potential therapeutic targets for obesity and type 2 diabetes.
