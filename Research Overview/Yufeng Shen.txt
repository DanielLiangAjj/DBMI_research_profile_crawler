Researcher: Yufeng Shen
Research Overview:
Yufeng Shen's research embodies a multifaceted exploration of adaptive biological mechanisms, genetic predispositions in congenital conditions, immune responses, and neurological disorders. His work spans various domains, including the study of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and its implications in human immunology, the investigation of neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and cognitive impairment, as well as the evaluation of postoperative complications in modified surgical procedures. Furthermore, Shen's research also delves into gene expression regulation and the impact of genetic variants on congenital anomalies like congenital heart disease and diaphragmatic hernia. In addition, he explores antiviral activities against various pathogens and the role of autophagy in health and disease. His findings contribute significantly to the understanding of developmental immunity, the genetics of organ transplantation, and the interplay between genetics and environmental factors in shaping human health. Overall, Shen's research integrates computational methods and deep learning approaches to enhance genetic associations and immunological insights, positioning it at the forefront of modern biomedical research.
