Researcher: Mary D'Alton
Research Overview:
Mary D'Alton's research primarily focuses on the intersection of chronic pain and cognitive mechanisms, particularly how music listening can influence pain perception and psychological well-being. Her work is situated within the broader context of obstetrics and gynecology, with an emphasis on pregnancy-related complications and maternal health outcomes. D'Alton has also investigated various factors affecting hospitalization and readmission rates in postpartum women, alongside examining infectious risks such as Hepatitis C and their implications for both mothers and newborns. By exploring both psychological factors and clinical risks, D'Alton contributes valuable insights into improving patient care and understanding the multifaceted nature of health challenges faced during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
