Researcher: Gulgun Tezel
Research Overview:
Gulgun Tezel's research predominantly focuses on the intricate relationships between neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and glaucoma, with a significant emphasis on the role of glial cells, specifically astroglia, in these processes. Through extensive studies using animal models, including transgenic mice and rats, Tezel investigates how cytokines and molecular signaling pathways contribute to retinal ganglion cell survival and death. Key aspects of the research involve the application of various advanced imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography, alongside proteomic approaches to identify potential biomarkers and assess changes in ocular health related to intraocular pressure and ocular hypertension. The integration of immunological studies highlights Tezel's dedication to understanding the immunomodulatory effects within the glaucomatous environment. Overall, this body of work aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying glaucoma pathology and to explore therapeutic strategies that may harness neuroprotection and regeneration potentials, ultimately improving prognosis for patients affected by this leading cause of irreversible blindness.
