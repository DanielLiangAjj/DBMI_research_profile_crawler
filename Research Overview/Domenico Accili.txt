Researcher: Domenico Accili
Research Overview:
Domenico Accili's research primarily focuses on understanding the complex mechanisms underlying diabetes and its associated metabolic disorders, including autoimmunity, insulin resistance, and the dedifferentiation of pancreatic beta cells. Utilizing various animal models, his work explores the roles of key transcription factors such as FoxO1 and HNF4A in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. Additionally, he investigates novel therapeutic approaches, including the development of selective insulin sensitizers and targeted drug therapies to enhance insulin action and improve metabolic health. His studies also address the interplay between diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and the gut microbiome, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of these interconnected conditions. Accili's findings aim to pave the way for the development of advanced treatment options for diabetes and its complications, emphasizing the importance of transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, and cellular plasticity in the management of metabolic diseases.
