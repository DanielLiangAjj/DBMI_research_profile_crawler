Researcher: Julian Agin-Liebes
Research Overview:
Julian Agin-Liebes' research focuses on the intricate relationship between genetic factors and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly emphasizing the role of LRRK2 and TDP-43 proteins in the pathology of Parkinson's disease and associated movement disorders such as Tourette syndrome. His studies delve into neuropathological mechanisms, investigating how mutations in DNA-binding proteins like LRRK2 contribute to neuronal degeneration and protein aggregation, particularly involving alpha-synuclein and tau proteins. Additionally, Agin-Liebes explores therapeutic avenues such as neurofeedback, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to mitigate symptoms. His work also touches upon immunological aspects related to the disease, highlighting the potential involvement of T-lymphocyte responses and autoimmunity. Overall, his research contributes to a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases and seeks to inform potential interventions for affected individuals.
