Researcher: Cindy Smalletz
Research Overview:
Cindy Smalletz's research focuses on breast cancer, particularly in the context of consumer health informatics and decision-making processes related to genetic testing and risk communication. Her work emphasizes the development of decision aids to support individuals in making informed choices concerning risk-stratified screening and early detection of breast neoplasms. By incorporating insights from focus groups and considering ethnic and demographic factors, her studies address communication barriers and enhance risk assessment strategies. Overall, Smalletzâ€™s research aims to improve the decision-making landscape for women, particularly middle-aged individuals in the United States, as they navigate the complexities of breast cancer prevention and health management.
