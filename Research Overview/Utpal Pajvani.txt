Researcher: Utpal Pajvani
Research Overview:
Utpal Pajvani's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationships between insulin secretion, diabetes, liver diseases, and metabolic disorders. His work encompasses the role of pancreatic beta and alpha cells in diabetes pathology, highlighting factors influencing beta cell maturity and functionality such as Notch signaling, PPARÎ³ acetylation, and transcription factors like MafA and FOXO1. He investigates the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), exploring the mechanisms of liver fibrosis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma. Pajvani's studies extend to the impact of obesity on metabolic dysfunction, the significance of macrophage activity in adipose tissue remodeling, and the effects of pharmacological interventions such as metformin and thiazolidinediones. Moreover, he employs model organisms to elucidate the molecular pathways governing insulin resistance and liver cirrhosis. Through his explorations, Pajvani aims to uncover novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision medicine approaches in treating metabolic diseases and their complications.
