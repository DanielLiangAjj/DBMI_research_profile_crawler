Researcher: Hans-Willem Snoeck
Research Overview:
Hans-Willem Snoeck's research primarily focuses on the molecular biology and stem cell dynamics involved in hematopoiesis, lung development, and pulmonary diseases. His work extensively examines the mechanisms of stem cell differentiation, particularly in relation to hematopoietic stem cells, and explores the impacts of various signaling pathways such as NOTCH, WNT, and TGF-Î². A significant aspect of his research is the modeling of diseases like Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and myelodysplastic syndromes through the utilization of pluripotent stem cells and organoids. Additionally, he investigates the role of calcium signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, and the Warburg effect in cellular metabolism and DNA damage response. By leveraging advanced techniques such as RNA sequencing and single-cell analysis, Snoeck aims to deepen the understanding of cell lineage and the cellular microenvironment in order to develop therapeutic strategies for blood-related disorders and lung diseases. Through his comprehensive studies, he contributes valuable insights into regenerative medicine and the potential for stem cell therapies in treating complex diseases.
