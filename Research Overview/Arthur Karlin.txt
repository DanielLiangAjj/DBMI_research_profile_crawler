Researcher: Arthur Karlin
Research Overview:
Arthur Karlin's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily focused on calcium channels and their integral role in cardiology and cardiovascular diseases. His work delves into the mechanisms of excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes, exploring the structure and function of ligand-gated ion channels, particularly nicotinic receptors. Utilizing advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy, Karlin investigates the molecular conformation and gating mechanisms of these membrane proteins, contributing to our understanding of ion channel dynamics. His studies also involve the interaction of various agents, including adrenergic compounds and toxins like Î±-bungarotoxin, with calcium channels and other receptors, further elucidating their pharmacological relevance. Through the application of patch-clamp methods and analysis in animal models, Karlin aims to provide insights into the molecular underpinnings of arrhythmias and other cardiovascular disorders, ultimately informing potential therapeutic strategies.
