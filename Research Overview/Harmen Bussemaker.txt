Researcher: Harmen Bussemaker
Research Overview:
Harmen Bussemaker's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms of gene regulation, particularly the specificity and activity of transcription factors. His work employs biophysically interpretable machine learning and statistical modeling techniques to unravel how non-coding genetic variations and missense mutations impact DNA binding specificity and transcription factor dynamics. Utilizing high-throughput methodologies such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, he examines the role of epigenetic modifications, like DNA methylation and structural configurations of DNA, in regulating gene expression. Additionally, Bussemaker investigates the interplay between transcription factors and their binding sites within the context of gene regulatory networks, employing computational biology approaches to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) and explore trans-acting genetic variation. His research contributes to a deeper understanding of how developmental transcription factors, particularly the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain families, orchestrate intricate regulatory networks that govern cellular differentiation and response to genetic mutations, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of genetic predisposition to diseases and regulatory complexities in various biological systems.
