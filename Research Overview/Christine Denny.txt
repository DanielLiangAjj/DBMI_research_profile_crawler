Researcher: Christine Denny
Research Overview:
Christine Denny's research centers on the intricate interplay between neurobiology, memory, and psychiatric disorders, particularly focusing on the hippocampus and its associated processes. Utilizing a combination of animal models (particularly mice) and advanced techniques such as optogenetics, Denny investigates the roles of immediate early genes like Arc and Fos in memory encoding and retrieval, the impact of stress on neurogenesis, and the neurochemical pathways underlying resilience against conditions like depression and PTSD. Her work emphasizes the physiological effects of the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, such as (R,S)-ketamine, exploring their potential therapeutic roles in treating stress-related disorders and cognitive decline associated with aging. Furthermore, Denny's research addresses sex differences in behavioral responses to stress and memory processes, aiming to enhance understanding of how these factors contribute to psychiatric conditions across different demographics. Overall, her investigations contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular and circuit-level dynamics of memory and emotion, paving the way for novel treatments for mental health disorders.
