Researcher: Amelia Averitt
Research Overview:
Dr. Amelia Averitt's research significantly spans chronic liver diseases and their intersection with genetics, lifestyle, and health outcomes. She investigates conditions like cirrhosis and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, leveraging genomic approaches like whole-exome sequencing and polygenic risk scores. Her work in epidemiology encompasses diverse populations, revealing genetic predispositions to chronic diseases and cancers, while also addressing cardiometabolic diseases and female health conditions. Additionally, her research utilizes advanced methodologies, including Mendelian randomization and machine learning techniques such as deep learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs), to enhance causal inference and generalizability of findings. By integrating lifestyle factors like diet and addressing the economic burden of healthcare resource use, Dr. Averitt aims to inform evidence-based medicine and improve treatment outcomes for complex disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and opioid-related disorders. Overall, her comprehensive approach strives to elucidate the multifactorial nature of chronic diseases, paving the way for targeted interventions and improved healthcare strategies.
