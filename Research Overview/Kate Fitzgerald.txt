Researcher: Kate Fitzgerald
Research Overview:
Kate Fitzgerald's research revolves around the intricate relationships between childhood anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and various neuropsychological processes. Her work emphasizes the significance of cognitive control and error processing mechanisms, as evidenced by her study of error-related negativity (ERN) and error-related alpha suppression in both pediatric and adult populations. Fitzgerald employs advanced neuroimaging techniques, including fMRI and EEG, to investigate brain connectivity and the role of specific neural networks, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and default mode network, in the manifestation of anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Her focus on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention indicates a commitment to developing effective therapeutic strategies for adolescents and children suffering from anxiety and OCD. Further, her studies contribute to our understanding of the psychopathology underlying these conditions, highlighting how factors such as repetitive negative thinking and self-regulation shape mental health outcomes across different developmental stages. Through her expansive research efforts, Fitzgerald aids in the identification of potential biomarkers and treatment outcomes, ultimately striving to enhance mental health interventions for youth in various settings, including schools and clinical environments.
