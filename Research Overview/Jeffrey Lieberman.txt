Researcher: Jeffrey Lieberman
Research Overview:
Jeffrey Lieberman's research focuses extensively on various aspects of schizophrenia, depression, and gun violence, particularly emphasizing the interplay between genetics, pharmacogenetics, and neurodevelopmental factors. His work examines the links between severe mental illnesses and violent behavior, including mass shootings and gun violence in academic settings. Lieberman's studies involve investigating genetic markers associated with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, tardive dyskinesia, and cognitive deficits, utilizing tools like MRI and genome-wide association studies. He also explores the potential roles of neurotransmitter systems, particularly dopamine and glutamate, on cognitive functioning and the impacts of antipsychotic medications on weight gain and metabolic disorders. Additionally, his contributions to understanding clinical high-risk populations for psychosis aim to advance early detection and intervention strategies. Through this multifaceted approach, Lieberman's research seeks to enhance our understanding of mental health disorders and their social implications, ultimately aiming to inform better therapeutic strategies and preventive measures against violence linked to mental health crises.
