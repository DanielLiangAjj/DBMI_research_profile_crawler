Researcher: Emmanuelle Passegué
Research Overview:
Emmanuelle Passegué's research focuses on the intricate dynamics of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their roles in aging, inflammation, and regeneration. Her work encompasses a broad range of topics, including the mechanisms of autophagy, metabolic regulation, and the impacts of the stem cell niche on hematopoiesis. Key aspects of her studies investigate how age-related changes influence HSC function, emergency myelopoiesis, and responses to inflammatory stimuli, including the roles of specific cytokines such as interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Passegué explores the interplay between HSCs and various progenitor cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages, as well as the epigenetic factors that govern stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Incorporating advanced methodologies such as single-cell analysis, her research also delves into the regeneration processes in different organ systems and the therapeutic implications for diseases like leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Overall, her contributions significantly enhance our understanding of HSC biology and its relevance to aging and regenerative medicine, highlighting novel pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic interventions.
