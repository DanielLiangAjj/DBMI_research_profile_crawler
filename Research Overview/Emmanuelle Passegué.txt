Researcher: Emmanuelle Passegué
Research Overview:
Emmanuelle Passegué's research focuses on various aspects of hematopoietic stem cell biology and the intricate relationships between aging, inflammation, metabolism, and stem cell function. Her work extensively explores mechanisms such as autophagy, cell differentiation, and quiescence in hematopoietic stem cells, particularly in the context of aging and disease. Passegué investigates how these factors influence regeneration, emergency myelopoiesis, and the response to inflammatory stimuli, bridging gaps in understanding maternal-fetal interactions and the regulation of immune responses. She applies advanced techniques, including single-cell analysis, to unravel the complex signaling pathways that govern stem cell behavior, the immune microenvironment, and their implications in hematologic conditions such as leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Overall, her research contributes significantly to the fields of regenerative medicine, cancer biology, and the development of therapeutic strategies targeting stem cell dynamics in various disease contexts.
