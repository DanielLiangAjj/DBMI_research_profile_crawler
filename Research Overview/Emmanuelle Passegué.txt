Researcher: Emmanuelle Passegué
Research Overview:
Emmanuelle Passeguéis research primarily focuses on the complex interplay between aging, inflammation, and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) biology. Her studies investigate how aging impacts HSC function and regeneration, including the mechanisms underlying autophagy, epigenetic regulation, and metabolic changes in these cells. Emmanuelle's work explores the roles of inflammatory cytokines and the stem cell niche in regulating HSC activity during homeostasis and pathology, such as leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. She also examines maternal-fetal interactions and their implications on hematopoiesis during development, addressing how external factors may influence stem cell behavior and immune responses. The integration of single-cell analysis and animal model studies provides insights into cellular signaling pathways and cell lineage differentiation critical for advancing regenerative medicine and understanding age-related hematological disorders. Overall, her research contributes valuable knowledge to the fields of stem cell biology, immunology, and hematology, emphasizing the importance of the aging process and inflammatory contexts in hematopoietic systems.
