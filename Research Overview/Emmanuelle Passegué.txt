Researcher: Emmanuelle Passegué
Research Overview:
Emmanuelle Passegué's research focuses on the intricate dynamics of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in both physiological and pathological contexts, with significant emphasis on aging, inflammation, and regeneration. Utilizing a variety of techniques including single-cell analysis, the work investigates how factors such as autophagy, metabolism, and immune responses affect stem cell behavior and regeneration capabilities. Key themes include the impact of maternal-fetal interactions, the regulation of HSC niches, and the role of cytokines such as interleukin-10 in hematopoietic development and response to injury. By exploring the mechanics of emergency myelopoiesis and extramedullary hematopoiesis, as well as the interplay between stem cells and their microenvironments, this research contributes significantly to the understanding of tissue regeneration, cancer, and the aging process. Overall, Passegué's work enhances our insight into how hematopoietic stem cells can be harnessed for regenerative medicine and how their dysregulation contributes to diseases such as leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.
