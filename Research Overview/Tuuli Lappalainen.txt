Researcher: Tuuli Lappalainen
Research Overview:
Tuuli Lappalainen's research encompasses a comprehensive investigation of gene expression, genetic variation, and their interplay with various diseases, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as RNA sequencing, multi-omics approaches, and machine learning techniques, Lappalainen has explored the complexities of gene regulation, including the effects of DNA methylation, alternative splicing, and the functional impact of rare variants. This work emphasizes the significance of gene-environment interactions and the role of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in understanding phenotypic diversity across populations. Additionally, Lappalainen's studies underscore the importance of integrating genetic data with clinical insights to improve risk prediction and personalized medicine for COPD and other respiratory diseases. By addressing the heritable and multifactorial aspects of these conditions, the research contributes to broader fields such as statistical genetics and functional genomics, paving the way for future developments in disease management and therapeutic strategies.
