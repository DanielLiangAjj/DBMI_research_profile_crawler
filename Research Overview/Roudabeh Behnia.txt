Researcher: Roudabeh Behnia
Research Overview:
Roudabeh Behnia's research encompasses a diverse array of topics across multiple disciplines including dentistry, pulmonology, oncology, and neuroscience. She investigates the applications of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins and Platelet-Rich Fibrin in dental procedures like pulpotomy and mandibular osteotomies, exploring their roles in bone regeneration and healing. In the realm of pulmonary health, her work focuses on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), examining factors such as exercise intolerance and lung function through various diagnostic modalities. Additionally, Behnia's research extends to the neurological impacts of viral infections, notably alphaviruses causing encephalitis, while also addressing emotional and cognitive factors associated with autism spectrum disorder. Utilizing advanced methodologies, including convolutional neural networks for gait analysis and imaging techniques for cancer diagnosis, her contributions significantly advance our understanding of the complex interplay between biological systems and therapeutic interventions. Overall, Behnia's interdisciplinary research provides valuable insights into enhancing patient care and treatment outcomes across different medical domains.
