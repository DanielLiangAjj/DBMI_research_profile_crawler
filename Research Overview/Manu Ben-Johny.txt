Researcher: Manu Ben-Johny
Research Overview:
Manu Ben-Johny's research focuses on the intricate mechanisms governing ion channels, particularly voltage-gated sodium (Nav1.5) and calcium (CaV) channels, and their roles in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. Through a combination of advanced techniques such as mass spectrometry, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and high-throughput screening assays, Ben-Johny investigates how post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation, affect channel function and protein interactions. The work delves into various cardiac conditions, including arrhythmias and long QT syndrome, while also exploring the biophysical properties and stoichiometry of ion channels. Ben-Johny's contributions position him at the cutting edge of cardiology and ion channel biophysics, aiming to bridge molecular mechanisms with therapeutic potentials for cardiovascular diseases.
