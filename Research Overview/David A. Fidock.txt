Researcher: David A. Fidock
Research Overview:
David A. Fidock's research centers on understanding and combating drug resistance in malaria, particularly focusing on the Plasmodium species, including *P. falciparum* and *P. berghei*. His work encompasses drug discovery efforts, targeting novel antimalarial compounds and mechanisms of action associated with drug resistance. One area of emphasis is the characterization of key proteins and genetic factors, such as import and export mechanisms involving transporters like *PfCRT*, and the use of advanced molecular techniques like CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing. His studies also explore the biochemical pathways and cellular processes involved in lipid metabolism and protein degradation through the proteasome, which are critical in the malaria parasite's lifecycle and response to therapeutics. Fidock has contributed significantly to the development and evaluation of combination therapies, particularly artemisinin-based regimens, in the context of rising resistance, while also investigating the molecular epidemiology of these developments. His holistic approach integrates computational biology, proteomics, and drug interaction studies, aiming to enhance antimalarial strategies and address global health challenges posed by malaria.
