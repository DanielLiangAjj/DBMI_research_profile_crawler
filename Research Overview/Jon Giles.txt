Researcher: Jon Giles
Research Overview:
Jon Giles' research primarily focuses on the intricate relationship between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), particularly examining how systemic inflammation influences both conditions. His studies explore the role of biomarkers, such as serum amyloid A and various autoantibodies, in predicting cardiovascular risk in RA patients. He investigates the impact of different treatment strategies, including disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, on cardiovascular health outcomes, highlighting the risks of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and heart failure associated with inflammatory processes. His work utilizes advanced imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, to assess vascular and cardiac health in these patients. Additionally, Giles addresses the implications of lifestyle factors, metabolic syndrome, and psychosocial aspects like disability and quality of life on disease progression and management. Overall, his research aims to advance understanding of the intersection between autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular morbidity, ultimately aiming to improve treatment approaches for at-risk populations.
