Researcher: Annemieke de Jong
Research Overview:
Annemieke de Jong's research spans several critical areas within dermatology and immunology, focusing on the mechanisms of antigen presentation and the role of CD1 antigen-presenting molecules in T-cell activation, particularly concerning skin-related diseases. A significant portion of her work investigates the effects of lipids, autoimmunity, and the mycobiome, particularly in relation to conditions like alopecia areata and the immune dysfunction observed in responses to HIV and other infectious agents. Furthermore, her exploration of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, including its role in proteolysis and protein modifications, highlights the intricate relationship between protein dynamics and immune responses. De Jongâ€™s research integrates various fields, including the interactions between the immune system, skin microbiomes, and the implications for chronic diseases, combining advanced techniques such as activity-based protein profiling and cellular assays to provide insights into therapeutic avenues and biomarkers for autoimmune conditions. This comprehensive approach not only enhances our understanding of dermatological immunity but also addresses broader implications for immune-related disorders and their treatment.
