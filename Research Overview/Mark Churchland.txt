Researcher: Mark Churchland
Research Overview:
Mark Churchland's research focuses on understanding the complex interactions of the motor system and the underlying neural mechanisms governing movement in both humans and primates, particularly the rhesus macaque. His work integrates concepts from neuroscience, behavioral studies, and mathematical modeling to explore motor control, motor learning, and neural computation. Key areas of investigation include the dynamics of spiking networks and recurrent neural networks, as well as the role of population coding in motor cortex function. He leverages techniques such as electromyography (EMG), microstimulation, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to study movement generation, preparation, and reaction time. Furthermore, his research addresses the implications of these neural processes in contexts like stroke recovery and the enhancement of prosthetic devices, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of motor behavior and its computational frameworks.
