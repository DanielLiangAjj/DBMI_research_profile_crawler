Researcher: Darcy Kelley
Research Overview:
Darcy Kelley's research predominantly focuses on the neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying vocal communication in various anuran species, with a particular emphasis on the genus *Xenopus*. The interplay between auditory perception, central pattern generators, and vocalization forms a core component of her investigations. She examines evolutionary adaptations related to sex differences in vocal behaviors, highlighting how hormonal influences—such as androgens—affect neural circuits responsible for sound production. Kelley's work integrates acoustic stimulation studies and neural activity assessment to explore motor circuits involved in vocal display and communication patterns, as well as their ecological implications. Her research not only contributes to understanding the complex neural basis of vocalization in frogs but also sheds light on broader themes of evolutionary biology, behavior, and the phylogenetic relationships among vertebrates. Ultimately, Kelley's studies bridge the fields of neuroscience, ecology, and evolutionary biology, making significant strides in our understanding of anuran communication systems.
