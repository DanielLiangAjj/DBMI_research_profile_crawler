Researcher: Raju Tomer
Research Overview:
Raju Tomer's research spans a diverse range of topics primarily within the fields of neuroscience and biological sciences. His work focuses on the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning antidepressant effects, particularly investigating the roles of dopamine and ketamine in promoting neural circuit adaptations and synaptic plasticity through advanced techniques such as whole-brain mapping, calcium imaging, and light sheet microscopy. Additionally, he delves into the intricacies of biofilm physiology and metabolic heterogeneity, specifically in the context of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, where he applies methodologies like CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and tissue clearing. His exploration of neuroanatomy covers critical regions like the arcuate nucleus and its relationship with feeding behaviors, while also addressing the complexities of blood-brain barrier dynamics using focused ultrasound for gene delivery. Overall, Tomerâ€™s work melds cutting-edge imaging and genetic techniques to enhance our understanding of brain function and plasticity, while also contributing to the field of microbiology, particularly regarding the adaptive behaviors of bacterial biofilms.
