Researcher: Sandra Ryeom
Research Overview:
Sandra Ryeom's research focuses on various aspects of cancer biology, particularly molecular oncology, germ cell development, and gastric cancer. Her work encompasses the intricate relationships between cancer stem cells, tumor microenvironments, and therapeutic strategies such as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies, as well as immunotherapy. Ryeom's studies delve into specific conditions, such as Pallister-Killian syndrome and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, examining biomarkers and genetic predispositions including germline mutations like CDH1. She investigates the roles of cellular processes, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis, in the progression and metastasis of tumors such as seminomas and gastric adenocarcinomas. Her methodologies include the use of patient-derived organoids and in vitro culture techniques to better understand cancer biology and chemosensitivity. With a strong emphasis on the development and application of targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and understanding the tumor microenvironment, Ryeom's research aims to enhance treatment outcomes and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms governing cancer initiation and progression.
