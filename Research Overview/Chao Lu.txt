Researcher: Chao Lu
Research Overview:
Chao Lu's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics primarily focused on cancer biology, molecular mechanisms, and therapeutic interventions. Key themes in Lu's work include the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts and exosomes in hepatocellular carcinoma, the influence of microRNAs on tumor stemness and metastasis, and the exploration of novel drug delivery systems utilizing nanocarriers and photosensitizers. Additionally, the impact of Chinese medicinal compounds and integrative medical approaches on conditions like inflammation and cancer treatment is investigated. Lu's contributions also delve into the epigenetics of cancer, emphasizing the importance of histone modifications and DNA methylation in tumor progression. Furthermore, the researcher examines the immune system's response to tumors and the potential for using immunotherapy as a therapeutic strategy. Collectively, Lu's multifaceted research aims to unravel the complex interplay between molecular pathways and therapeutic outcomes in various cancers, while also addressing broader biological and ecological implications through microbiome studies and the effects of environmental factors on health.
