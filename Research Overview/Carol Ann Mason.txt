Researcher: Carol Ann Mason
Research Overview:
Carol Ann Mason's research focuses on several interconnected areas within regenerative medicine, neurobiology, and ocular health, particularly regarding the restoration of vision and neuroprotection in conditions affecting the optic nerves and retina, such as glaucoma and optic neuropathy. Utilizing innovative approaches, including the study of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), neurogenesis, and aspects of developmental biology, her work explores critical factors such as axon guidance, cellular differentiation, and the role of stem cells and organoids. She investigates the molecular pathways, including signaling mechanisms involving semaphorins and Wnt signaling, that are essential for the proper development and regeneration of the visual system. Additionally, her studies employ advanced techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and microscopy, to elucidate the complex cellular interactions and the underlying neurobiological processes. By contributing to a deeper understanding of ocular physiology and the mechanisms of neuroregeneration, Mason's research aims to advance therapeutic strategies for vision restoration and improved outcomes in patients with retinal diseases.
