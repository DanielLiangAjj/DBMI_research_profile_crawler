Researcher: Gaurav Patel
Research Overview:
Gaurav Patel's research primarily focuses on the cognitive and neural underpinnings of various psychological disorders, particularly alcohol use disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), Patel explores the relationship between cognitive control, social cognition, and emotion regulation in the context of these disorders. Key areas of investigation include the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and other brain regions in craving and attention, as well as their functional connectivity in both resting-state and task-oriented settings. The research emphasizes the importance of visual and auditory processing, face-emotion recognition, and the brain's connectome in understanding individual differences in cognitive processing and social interactions. By integrating concepts such as theory-of-mind and network topology, Patel aims to provide insights that could improve clinical interventions, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and advance our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying psychological conditions. Overall, his work contributes to a deeper understanding of how cognitive deficits manifest in various mental health disorders and how they can be addressed through targeted therapeutic approaches.
