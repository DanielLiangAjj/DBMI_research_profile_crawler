Researcher: Falak Sher
Research Overview:
Falak Sher's research primarily focuses on the intricate roles of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular emphasis on Alzheimerâ€™s disease. By employing advanced techniques such as CRISPR and chromatin accessibility profiling (ATAC-Seq), the researcher investigates the functional genomics involved in microglial behavior and their interaction with amyloid beta-peptides. The use of proteomics alongside induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) enables a deeper understanding of gene expression regulation and chromatin dynamics in the context of neurodegeneration. Overall, Sher's work aims to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, leveraging insights from both human and animal studies to advance the field of functional genomics and provide potential therapeutic avenues.
