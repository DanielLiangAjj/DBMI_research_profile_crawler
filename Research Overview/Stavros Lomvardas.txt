Researcher: Stavros Lomvardas
Research Overview:
Stavros Lomvardas' research focuses on the complex interplay between chromatin structure, gene expression, and neurogenesis, particularly in the context of olfactory sensory neurons and their developmental biology. His work explores critical epigenetic mechanisms, including histone methylation and transcriptional regulation, that influence stochastic gene choice among olfactory receptors, underscoring the relationship between nuclear architecture and sensory perception. Additionally, Lomvardas investigates the roles of various transcription factors and enhancer elements in gene expression regulation, contributing to our understanding of neurodevelopmental processes, including axon guidance and synaptic function. His studies extend into the realms of genomics and cellular responses to stress, as seen in his investigations into the unfolded protein response in the context of disorders like schizophrenia and COVID-19-induced anosmia. By employing innovative techniques such as soft X-ray tomography and single-cell analysis, Lomvardas' research not only advances our fundamental knowledge of olfactory biology but also has significant implications for understanding neurocognitive disorders and sensory impairments.
