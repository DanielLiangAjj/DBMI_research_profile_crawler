Researcher: George Cioffi
Research Overview:
George Cioffi's research significantly focuses on the epidemiology of glaucoma and its implications for public health, particularly in underserved populations. His work addresses various aspects of eye health screening, emphasizing community-based optometric examinations and the integration of telemedicine to enhance healthcare access. Cioffi investigates the mechanisms affecting vision impairment, such as glaucoma's progression, ocular hypertension, and refractive errors, using advanced techniques like optical coherence tomography (OCT) and neural networks for data analysis. His studies underscore the importance of patient activation and adherence to treatment regimens, aiming to improve outcomes for vulnerable groups. Furthermore, he explores health services accessibility, risk stratification for cataracts, and the role of clinician knowledge and attitudes in glaucoma detection. By using innovative approaches, including machine learning and community outreach, Cioffi seeks to enhance the effectiveness of vision screening and reduce disparities in eye care, ultimately contributing to improved quality of life for individuals at risk of blindness.
