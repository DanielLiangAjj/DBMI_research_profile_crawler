Researcher: Vikram Gadagkar
Research Overview:
Vikram Gadagkar's research primarily focuses on understanding the interplay between neural mechanisms and behavior in songbirds, particularly in relation to vocalization and motor skills. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as Gaussian process models and generalized linear models, his work investigates the role of key brain structures, including the basal ganglia and ventral tegmental area, in learning and maintaining motor skills associated with birdsong. The influence of dopamine and dopaminergic neurons is a central theme, as these neurotransmitters are critical for performance prediction and behavioral feedback. Gadagkar's studies encompass various aspects of animal behavior, such as courtship and communication, while employing techniques like electrophysiology and accelerometry to analyze the physiological underpinnings of these processes. Overall, his research sheds light on the neurobiological foundations of learning and performance in natural behaviors, emphasizing the relevance of these findings across species.
