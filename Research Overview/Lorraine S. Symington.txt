Researcher: Lorraine S. Symington
Research Overview:
Lorraine S. Symington's research significantly advances our understanding of DNA damage repair mechanisms, particularly focusing on homologous recombination and the roles of various proteins in maintaining genome integrity. Utilizing the model organism *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, Symington investigates critical processes such as DNA double-strand break repair, replication fork stalling, and end resection facilitated by key proteins like Mre11, Rad51, CtIP, and Exo1. Her work encompasses a variety of DNA repair pathways, including break-induced replication and microhomology-mediated end joining, as well as chromatin dynamics influencing repair efficiency. Additionally, her research examines genetic factors contributing to genomic instability and chromosome rearrangements, highlighting the interplay between DNA repair mechanisms and cell cycle regulation. Ultimately, Symington's findings have broad implications for understanding DNA repair processes not only in yeast but also in higher organisms, advancing knowledge in fields like cancer biology and genetic disorders.
