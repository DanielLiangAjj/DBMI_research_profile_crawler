Researcher: Neil L. Harrison
Research Overview:
Neil L. Harrison's research encompasses multiple facets of neuroscience and physiology, particularly focusing on the mechanisms underlying alcohol's effects on the brain, coagulopathy associated with COVID-19, and the influence of ion channels and synaptic transmission in different neurological conditions. His studies investigate the roles of various proteins and receptors, such as GABA and glycine receptors in interneurons, and their impact on behavior and cognitive functions like working memory, particularly in the context of alcohol exposure during adolescence. Harrison's research on COVID-19 highlights the coagulation disturbances linked to SARS-CoV-2, examining biomarkers such as von Willebrand Factor and Tissue Plasminogen Activator. Through methodologies including electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and optogenetics, his work provides crucial insights into the interactions between neurobiology and external stressors, advancing our understanding of both brain function and the systemic effects of viral infections. Overall, Harrisonâ€™s contributions are pivotal in elucidating the neurophysiological impact of substances like alcohol and understanding coagulopathy in viral infections, ultimately informing therapeutic approaches for affected populations.
