Researcher: Elizabeth Oelsner
Research Overview:
Elizabeth Oelsner's research focuses extensively on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its myriad associations with factors such as nutritional epidemiology, genetics, and environmental exposures. Her work encompasses the exploration of airflow obstruction and its implications for lung function, utilizing advanced methodologies including spirometry and quantitative imaging techniques like CT and MRI. Oelsner investigates the genetic predisposition to COPD, utilizing genome-wide association studies to elucidate relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms, lipid levels, and cardiovascular comorbidities such as heart failure. Additionally, her research touches on the epidemiology of interstitial lung disease and the role of environmental pollutants, including heavy metals and racial/ethnic disparities in respiratory health outcomes. The impact of COVID-19 on lung function and disease progression, particularly in relation to pre-existing respiratory conditions, is also a focal point. Through integrative analysis and cohort studies, Oelsner seeks to enhance risk prediction models for respiratory diseases, thereby contributing valuable insights into public health that underscore the significance of genetic factors, lifestyle choices, and environmental impacts on lung health across diverse populations.
