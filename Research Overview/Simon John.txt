Researcher: Simon John
Research Overview:
Simon John's research spans several domains primarily focusing on neurobiology, retinal health, and neurodegeneration, particularly in relation to glaucoma and neurogenesis. His studies involve peripheral areas such as the role of CyclinD2 in retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) biology, the implications of albinism on visual pathways, and advancements in understanding ciliary margin functionality. Key topics further include the neuroprotective effects of cellular metabolism, notably from proline synthesis and pyruvate metabolism, contributing to insights into retinal ganglion cell survival. He employs cutting-edge techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation to elucidate gene expression and regulation mechanisms, specifically targeting pathways involved in neuroinflammation and glial function related to ocular hypertension. His work extends to exploring the molecular genetics of diseases such as hypomyelinating leukodystrophy and their metabolic repercussions, confirming his interdisciplinary approach that inherently links neurobiology and genetics to advancements in ocular health and treatment strategies for conditions like glaucoma. Overall, his research significantly enriches the understanding of the cellular and molecular underpinnings of neurodegeneration and visual impairments, highlighting potential therapeutic avenues.
