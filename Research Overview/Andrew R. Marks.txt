Researcher: Andrew R. Marks
Research Overview:
Andrew R. Marks focuses his research on the intricate mechanisms of calcium signaling and homeostasis, particularly through the lens of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and its role in various cardiac and muscular diseases. His extensive work spans across various models, including induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and mouse models, to elucidate the pathophysiology behind conditions such as heart failure, muscle weakness, and congenital myopathies. Marks employs advanced techniques like cryo-electron microscopy to explore the structural biology of the ryanodine receptor, examining its interactions with calcium-binding proteins, post-translational modifications, and the implications of these interactions on excitation-contraction coupling and arrhythmias. His research intersects with various prominent areas such as drug screening, therapeutic interventions for heart conditions, and understanding the effects of cellular stress in health and disease. Ultimately, Marks aims to unravel the molecular underpinnings of calcium dysregulation that contribute to cardiovascular and muscular health, paving the way for innovative treatment strategies.
