Researcher: Churl-Su Kwon
Research Overview:
Churl-Su Kwon's research primarily focuses on the complex interplay between neurological conditions such as epilepsy and the impact of COVID-19, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic. His work addresses critical issues surrounding the epidemiology, comorbidities, hospitalization outcomes, and mortality rates associated with neurological complications arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Kwon has actively contributed to the development of reporting standards through the EQUATOR network, emphasizing the importance of guidelines and checklists for improving the quality of research in this field. His investigations encompass various aspects of epilepsy management, including the role of neuromodulation techniques like deep brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation, as well as advances in epilepsy surgery for drug-resistant cases. Furthermore, Kwon harnesses artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes, exploring the psychosocial dimensions of care, stigma, and health equity. Collectively, his extensive body of work seeks to bridge knowledge gaps while advocating for improved healthcare delivery systems and tailored interventions for affected populations.
