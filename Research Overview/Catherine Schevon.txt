Researcher: Catherine Schevon
Research Overview:
Catherine Schevon's research centers around the intricate dynamics of epilepsy, particularly focusing on the neural mechanisms underlying seizure activity and its implications for surgical and therapeutic interventions. Utilizing methodologies such as stereotactic electroencephalography, microelectrode arrays, and advanced neuroimaging techniques, her studies delve into the electrophysiological properties of neurons and their interconnectedness within the epileptic networks. Key topics include the role of inhibitory interneurons, the characterization of ictal wavefronts, and the effects of local cortical stimulation on seizure onset and propagation. Schevon also investigates treatment outcomes for drug-resistant epilepsy, evaluating approaches like laser interstitial thermal therapy and various surgical techniques aimed at localized seizure control. By combining insights from cognitive neuroscience with systems biology, her work not only enhances the understanding of epileptogenesis and seizure generalization but also contributes to innovative strategies for brain mapping and decision-making processes in clinical settings. Overall, her comprehensive approach aims to advance both the scientific understanding of epilepsy and the practical applications for improving patient outcomes.
