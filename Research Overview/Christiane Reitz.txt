Researcher: Christiane Reitz
Research Overview:
Christiane Reitz's research focuses extensively on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders, with a particular emphasis on genetic factors and their implications for diverse populations, especially Black or African American and Caribbean Hispanic communities. Her work combines genomic studies, including whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), with epidemiological investigations to understand the genetic predispositions associated with AD and early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Reitz addresses critical issues such as medical mistrust and recruitment of underserved populations for research participation, utilizing innovative methodologies like snowball sampling. Additionally, her studies examine the roles of specific genetic markers, such as APOE ε4 and variant mutations on chromosomes linked to AD, alongside the influence of cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and lifestyle factors. Reitz's contributions aim to enhance understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, guide future therapeutic strategies, and promote health equity in research outcomes among diverse demographic groups.
