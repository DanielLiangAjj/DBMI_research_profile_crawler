Researcher: Neil Vasan
Research Overview:
Neil Vasan's research focuses on the intricate relationships between metabolism, signaling pathways, and cancer biology, particularly breast cancer and immune responses. His work explores the role of Hippo kinases and PI3K signaling in glucose and glycogen metabolism, insights that contribute to understanding insulin sensitivity and hyperglycemia in tumor contexts. By employing cutting-edge techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 screens, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and mass spectrometry, Vasan investigates the mechanisms underlying cancer immunology, including immune checkpoint blockade and the resistance mechanisms against these therapies. His studies highlight the significance of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory balances in cancer immune evasion, potentially identifying predictive markers and therapeutic targets in precision medicine and molecularly targeted therapies. Overall, Vasan's research integrates metabolic pathways and genomic insights to unravel cancer mechanisms, enhancing strategies for cancer diagnosis and treatment.
