Researcher: Susan F. Steinberg
Research Overview:
Susan F. Steinberg's research primarily focuses on the intricate mechanisms of cardiomyocyte function, signaling pathways, and protein interactions related to cardiovascular health and disease. Her investigations delve into the roles of Î²1-adrenergic receptors, oxidative stress, and proteolysis, examining how these factors impact cardiac remodeling, heart failure, and related pathologies. Various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, play critical roles in modulating protein function within cardiomyocytes. Utilizing animal models, particularly zebrafish and rodent species, her studies address the underlying molecular processes linked to cardiomyocyte survival, apoptosis, and growth signaling pathways that are essential for cardiovascular development. Steinberg's work significantly contributes to enhancing our understanding of cardiac cellular dynamics, proteolytic processes, and adrenergic signaling that may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for heart disease treatment and prevention.
