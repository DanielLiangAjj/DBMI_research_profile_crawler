Researcher: Peter D. Kwong
Research Overview:
Peter D. Kwong's research focuses on the structural biology and immunology of various infectious diseases, particularly HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. His work utilizes advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography to elucidate the native structures of viral envelope proteins and their interactions with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). He emphasizes the design and stabilization of immunogens for vaccines, exploring unique strategies like structural modifications and bispecific antibodies to enhance immune responses against HIV-1 and influenza viruses. His investigations also delve into neutralization mechanisms, antibody affinity, and the impact of glycosylation on antibody recognition and binding, ultimately contributing to better vaccine designs and therapeutic approaches. By identifying vulnerable epitopes and assessing immune evasion, Kwong aims to develop actionable insights for combating viral infections and advancing vaccination strategies, which are critical in addressing pandemic preparedness and response.
