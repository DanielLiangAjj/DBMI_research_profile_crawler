Researcher: Melissa Stockwell
Research Overview:
Melissa Stockwell's research primarily focuses on the intersection of pediatrics, public health, and social determinants of health, particularly in relation to infectious diseases like COVID-19 and influenza. Her work extensively explores the impact of socio-economic factors on health outcomes in children and adolescents, including vaccination behaviors, healthcare accessibility, and the effectiveness of mobile health interventions such as text message reminders for vaccination. Stockwell investigates the implications of parental attitudes toward vaccinations and pandemic preparedness, aiming to reduce health disparities. Her studies also cover critical aspects of maternal and child health, addressing issues such as pregnancy complications related to infectious diseases, breastfeeding practices, and adolescent sexual and reproductive health. By incorporating elements of clinical epidemiology and digital health technologies, her research aims to enhance health communication and patient engagement, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes in young populations during public health crises.
