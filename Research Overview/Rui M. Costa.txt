Researcher: Rui M. Costa
Research Overview:
Rui M. Costa's research spans various aspects of neuroscience, particularly focusing on motor control, neuroprosthetics, cognitive processes, and the neurological effects of dopamine. His work employs cutting-edge methodologies, such as optogenetics, brain-machine interfaces, and advanced imaging techniques to explore intricate neural circuits and their relation to motor functions, learning, and decision-making. Research findings on motor cortex and spinal cord interactions highlight the dynamics of motor commands, which have implications for understanding disorders like Parkinson's disease and their treatment avenues. Additionally, Costa's studies touch on psychological factors affecting health behaviors, emotional regulation, and the impact of social factors during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, his work not only aims to unravel the complex neuronal underpinnings related to movement and behavior but also emphasizes the translational potential of neuroscience in developing therapeutic strategies and interventions.
