Researcher: Maura Boldrini
Research Overview:
Maura Boldrini's research focuses on the complex interplay between brain structure, function, and mental health disorders, particularly concerning depression, suicide, and the impact of early life stressors. Utilizing advanced methodologies like multiomics, neuroimaging techniques—including MRI and positron emission tomography—and single-cell RNA sequencing, her work delves into postmortem human brain analyses to reveal neurological underpinnings of psychiatric conditions. Central to her investigation are the roles of neurogenesis, serotonin receptors, and mitochondrial function, especially in regions like the hippocampus and the dorsal raphe nucleus. Her findings also address the neurobiological consequences of childhood adversity, late-life depression, and the brain's response to stress, highlighting potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Ultimately, Boldrini's research contributes valuable insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of mood disorders and offers avenues for future interventions in mental health care.
