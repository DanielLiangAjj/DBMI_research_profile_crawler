Researcher: Ka Kahe
Research Overview:
Dr. Ka Kahe's research encompasses a wide array of topics primarily focused on the intersections of nutrition, environmental factors, reproductive health, and cognitive function. Key areas of investigation include the impact of dietary components, such as omega-3 fatty acids, folic acid, and various vitamins on metabolic health, fertility, and cognitive outcomes, particularly amongst vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and postmenopausal women. Additionally, the research explores the detrimental effects of environmental exposures, including heavy metals like mercury and cadmium, and pollutants like radon and PM2.5, on health metrics including cognitive impairment and cardiovascular disease. Further themes include the influence of lifestyle factors, such as smoking and pet ownership, on mental health and disease susceptibility, thereby contributing to a nuanced understanding of health disparities across different demographics. In summary, Dr. Kahe's work emphasizes the critical interplay between nutrition, environmental health, and sociocultural variables in determining health outcomes across the lifespan.
