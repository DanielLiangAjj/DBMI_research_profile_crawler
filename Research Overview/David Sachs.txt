Researcher: David Sachs
Research Overview:
David Sachs' research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics mainly focused on xenotransplantation, transplant tolerance, and the mechanobiological aspects of tissue engineering. His work is particularly significant in understanding the role of different biological systems, including the dermis and extracellular matrix, in various transplant scenarios, including kidney and heart transplantation, while exploring options involving genetically modified swine and the use of miniaturized models. The development of advanced methodologies, such as bioinspired devices for minimally invasive blood microsampling and innovative 3D-printed culture systems, demonstrates his commitment to advancing point-of-care technologies and improving patient outcomes in chronic conditions such as end-stage kidney disease. Additionally, his research addresses the intersection of immunology and pharmacotherapy, particularly exploring interventions for smoking cessation and managing chronic diseases via telehealth solutions. Overall, Sachs has made pivotal contributions towards enhancing the understanding of immune tolerance mechanisms and engineering strategies that could revolutionize transplant success rates and organ preservation approaches.
