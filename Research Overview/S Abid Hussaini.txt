Researcher: S Abid Hussaini
Research Overview:
S Abid Hussaini's research focuses on the intricate relationship between spatial memory, neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease, and the underlying neural mechanisms such as activity maps, grid cells, and place cells. Through the examination of neurophysiological phenomena such as remapping, spatiotemporal stability, and synaptic dysfunction, Hussaini investigates how disruptions in these processes may contribute to cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer's. His work also explores the role of tau pathology and beta-amyloid accumulation in the context of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss, applying genetic therapy and optogenetics to study brain functions in both human and model systems, including various strains of mice. By utilizing advanced techniques in in vivo electrophysiology, neuroimaging, and genetic manipulation, Hussaini aims to uncover mechanisms of proteostasis and their implications on neuronal health, ultimately contributing to the understanding of synaptic function in the aging brain and the development of therapeutic strategies for Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
