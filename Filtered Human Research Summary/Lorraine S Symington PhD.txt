The process of homologous recombination plays essential roles in the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles of most eukaryotic organisms. During meiosis, the programmed formation and processing of double strand breaks by homologous recombination is obligatory to establish the mechanical force between chromosome homologues essential for their segregation. The absence of homologous recombination in meiosis leads to random segregation of homologues at the first meiotic division and formation of aneuploid gametes (spores in yeast).
