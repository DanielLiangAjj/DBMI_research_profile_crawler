Ian Kronish’s research has shown why those at greatest risk for recurrent cardiovascular events are least likely to adhere to prescribed regimens, and that patients’ distress about past and future cardiovascular events undermines health behaviors. As Director of an NIA-funded Roybal Center, he now aims to foster the development of interventions that improve mental health, adherence to recommended health behaviors, and cardiovascular outcomes in patients that have experienced acute cardiovascular events such as acute coronary syndrome and stroke. He has expertise in medication adherence, and has advanced methodologies for adherence measurement. He has been the PI of multiple federally-funded randomized clinical trials. He also has experience in implementation science research, and applies these methods to increase the uptake of evidence-based hypertension guidelines. He is a founding member of New York Presbyterian Hospital’s Digital Health Evaluation initiative, and has led the implementation of remote monitoring programs for hypertension and COVID-19.
