Research in the Landweber Lab focuses on microbial eukaryotes with complex genome architectures. We use both 1) functional genomic experiments that manipulate chromosome structure to study the roles of RNA in mediating epigenetic inheritance and genome programming, and 2) comparative genomic analysis to examine the origin and evolution of scrambled genome organization. The model organisms that we use have two nuclei, which permits comparative genomics within a single cell. One genome gives rise to the other during programmed genome reorganization, and we study how this system co-evolved with germline DNA transposons.
