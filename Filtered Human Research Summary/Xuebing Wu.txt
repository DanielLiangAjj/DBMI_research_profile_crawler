                The Wu lab integrates CRISPR, genomics, and machine learning to both decode and target RNA in human health and disease. The Wu lab seeks to bridge the discovery of basic mechanisms of gene regulation with the development of novel therapeutics for human diseases, focusing on cancer and cardiometabolic diseases.
