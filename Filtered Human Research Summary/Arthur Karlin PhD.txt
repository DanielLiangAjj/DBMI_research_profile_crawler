This is exemplified by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These receptors bind acetylcholine, transduce this binding into the opening of a pore, and conduct cations causing a depolarization of the synaptic membrane. The overall receptor structure and, within this, the specific sites and substructures at the front-line of these functional steps have been identified. More recently, this approach has been applied to the BK channel, a voltage- and calcium-ion-activated channel, widely expressed and responsible for membrane hyperpolarization. Recently, cellular functions that depend on circuits of signaling components have been considered. In these cases, in addition to individual molecular structures, cellular structures and the distribution of the molecular components in these structures determine the nature of the signaling that underlies the cellular function. Microdomains are crucial to the specificity and effectiveness of the signaling, as they both channel and amplify the signals. The approach to understanding such systems is to represent all steps as kinetic equations and to solve the resulting equations in time and space. To the extent that experimental data exist, the equations are fit to these data. Such a model is a mathematical summary of the known properties of the components and of the target cellular function, and it is also kinetically plausible and consistent with thermodynamics. Notwithstanding, such a model is a hypothetical outline of how the cell might function, always wanting experimental tests and refinement.
