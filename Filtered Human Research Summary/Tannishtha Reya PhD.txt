                The primary goal of our lab is to understand the signals that control self-renewal of stem cells, and how these signals are hijacked to fuel cancer growth. The lab has three primary areas of interest: analyzing the roles of stem cell signals in cancer progression, heterogeneity and therapy resistance; developing high-resolution imaging strategies to map the behavior and interactions of stem cells with the microenvironment in living animals and define how these interactions change during regeneration and cancer growth; and developing new strategies towards cancer therapy. These studies have implications not only for understanding the basic mechanisms that regulate normal and oncogenic self-renewal, but also for enhancing stem cell-based therapies for human disease.
