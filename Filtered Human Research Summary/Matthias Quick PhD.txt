                His research interests center around the molecular mechanism of integral membrane proteins with special emphasis on secondary transporters. The long-term goal of the research in his lab is to decipher the mechanism of these molecular machines at the molecular level to gain insight into their role in various physiological and pathophysiological processes and how drugs interfere with their activity. Current research focuses on the following areas: 1) Elucidation of the structure, function and dynamics of Na+-coupled transporters (symporters). Special emphasis is given to i) neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS) and ii) solute:sodium symporters (SSS). 2) Characterization of the molecular mechanism of the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine transporter (PfCRT). The goal of this study, that is conducted in close collaboration with CUIMC colleagues Drs. Fidock and Mancia, is to elucidate the role of PfCRT in malaria drug resistance and physiological context. 3) Development of new technologies to characterize membrane protein function. Using newly developed technologies, involving radiotracer-based and electrophysiological transport and binding studies in reconstituted systems, the Quick lab is currently performing studies on vesicular transporters, antiporters, channels, and receptors implicated in human diseases.
