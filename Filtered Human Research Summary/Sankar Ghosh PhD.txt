Groundbreaking discoveries over many decades have confirmed and elaborated on the close connection between the immune system and a host of diseases of major importance to public health, including cancer, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, diabetes, and celiac disease. Recent technological breakthroughs have allowed us to gain unprecedented insight into the regulatory networks that govern immune responses. Medical interventions that manipulate the immune system to target cancer, so-called cancer immunotherapies, have seen spectacular results in the treatment of certain tumors. And this is just the beginning. The Ghosh lab has a long-standing interest in understanding and elucidating the complexities of transcriptional regulation, with a particular focus on the innate and adaptive immune system. As pathological changes to the transcriptional programs of immune cells lie at the heart of many diseases, we aim to obtain a deep, mechanistic understanding of the pathways that establish, maintain, and fine-tune the immunological transcriptome. Based on this knowledge, we hope to devise novel, innovative approaches to combat some of humanity's most vexing afflictions. Current projects in the Ghosh lab include:
