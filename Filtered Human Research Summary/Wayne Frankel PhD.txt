My focus is on better modeling epilepsy at the physiological and molecular level using a multidisciplinary approach - genetics, genomics, cell biology and biochemistry - in genes encoding ion channels, synaptic molecules, RNA binding proteins and others. We are currently modeling severe pediatric epileptic encephalopathies in laboratory mice. Much of our research is part of a multi-platform close collaboration with other members of the Institute for Genomic Medicine (IGM), towards development of precision medicine-based novel therapies.
