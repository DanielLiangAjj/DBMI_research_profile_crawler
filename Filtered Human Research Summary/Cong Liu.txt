I am primarily trained in the methods of bioinformatics, statistical learning, machine learning, and their use for biomedical discovery using large-scale genomic data. I used these skills to develop a novel knowledge-guided feature selection method in machine learning related tasks for high-dimensional omics data. I have developed a novel system called Doc2Hpo for interactive and efficient phenotype concept curation from clinical text with automated concept normalization using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). I also developed a user-centered clinical trial searching application compatible with OHDSI to reduce the information overload.
