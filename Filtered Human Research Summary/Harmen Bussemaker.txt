                The Bussemaker lab aims to quantify the DNA binding specificity of transcription factors at unprecedented resolution. He is also using biophysical models to infer cell-state specific changes in the regulatory activity of transcription factors from genomewide mRNA expression levels. Other efforts include using natural genetic variation to dissect complex cis-regulatory logic, and understanding how local chromatin context modulates the influence of transcription factors on its target genes.
