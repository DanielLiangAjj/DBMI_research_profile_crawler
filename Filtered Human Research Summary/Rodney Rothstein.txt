Research in the Rothstein Lab has focused on several genes involved in maintaining genome stability, including factors that are important in addressing aberrations such as double-strand breaks in DNA or that function as checkpoints for monitoring the progression of cellular processes through the cell cycle. Their efforts have focused on the genes that code for Rad52, an important DNA repair protein; Sml1, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase; and the Top3/SGS1 DNA topoisomerase/helicase complex. In recent work, the researchers have been developing methods to facilitate the construction and rapid screening of arrayed yeast libraries. Accompanying these experimental advances has been the development of a method called Cutoff Linked to Interaction Knowledge (CLIK), which integrates prior biological knowledge about the yeast interactome with the results of high-throughput screens, providing a valuable metric for evaluating significance within high-throughput screening results.
