My laboratory models and studies the development of the nervous system in a culture dish. We have pioneered some of the most efficient methods for the differentiation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells into specific subtypes of spinal motor neurons and interneurons in vitro. The process faithfully recapitulates normal embryonic development, providing a unique opportunity to study neural development at a biochemical level in a controlled environment outside of the embryo. We combine the differentiation system with CRISPR based genome editing and with inducible transgene expression to decode transcriptional programs controlling progressive transitions from a pluripotent stem cell to a defined postmitotic neuron. We assembled a global map of genomic regulatory elements controlling motor neuron expression program. Our ultimate goal is to decipher the syntax and grammar of the "language" used by transcription factors to specify neuronal cell identity during embryonic development. The lab also capitalizes on the unlimited source of spinal neurons to study molecular processes underlying neuronal maturation, synapse formation, and neuronal aging and degeneration. We are using both mouse and human pluripotent stem cells to model motor neuron degenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrigâ€™s disease), with the goal of discovering new drugs that promote motor neuron survival.
