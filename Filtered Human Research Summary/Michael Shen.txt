                His laboratory pursues basic and translational research in the areas of mammalian embryogenesis and stem cell differentiation, as well as development of the prostate gland and molecular mechanisms of prostate tumorigenesis. These studies primarily utilize in vivo analyses involving genetically engineered mice as well as organoid culture methods to investigate molecular pathways, and integrate with systems approaches to elucidate mechanisms of cellular differentiation and cancer.
