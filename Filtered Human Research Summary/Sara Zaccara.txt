                In the field of m6A epitranscriptomics, a recently discovered post-transcriptional mechanism to control gene expression, Dr. Zaccara overturned long-held beliefs by proposing a unified model of how m6A mRNAs are controlled in cells with a paradigm-shifting study published in Cell in 2020. In her own lab, she plans to dissect the inner workings of m6A mRNA regulation. Her lab will integrate multiple high-throughput approaches, including cutting-edge base-editing screens, massively parallel reporter assays, and advanced data analysis to decipher how the dynamic regulation of critical m6A players controls m6A mRNA. One of the clearest examples where m6A deregulation contributes to disease is in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Dr. Zaccara contributed to seminal publications showing that elevated m6A levels maintain AML cells in an undifferentiated blast-like state. Her lab will continue exploring the contribution of m6A in AML and normal hemopoiesis, with unprecedented throughput and resolution. As RNA modifications play important roles in development, cancer, and several other human diseases, many CUIMC researchers have ongoing projects related to m6A modifications and will benefit from Dr. Zaccaraâ€™s expertise. Her work has been instrumental in assessing the role of m6A modification in normal and disease states. Additionally, she provided substantial contributions to solve the dogma of why the number of m6A sites in cellular mRNAs has functional consequences on mRNA fate. She applied her interdisciplinary skills in the development of a fully genetically-encoded technology to image RNAs.
