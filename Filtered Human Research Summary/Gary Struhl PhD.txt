During development, cells are programmed to generate and interpret spatial information so that every cell within a population knows where it is and what to do as a consequence. Dr. Struhl's work uses genetic and molecular approaches in Drosophila to address the fundamental questions (i) what is spatial information?, (ii) how is it generated?, and (iii) how is it interpreted? His work has led to discoveries about the nature and mode of action of spatial determinants controlling cell and body patterns, tissue growth, and planar cell polarity. These include (i) the Polycomb and HOX “selectors” in specifying body segments; (ii) the transcription and translation factors Bicoid, Caudal, Hunchback, and Nanos in organizing global body pattern, (iii) secreted factors of the Hedgehog, Wnt, and BMP/TGFb superfamilies as the first intercellular gradient morphogens, (iv) Delta/Notch signaling in cell-fate specification, and (v) the serpentine receptors Frizzled and Starry Night, and the atypical cadherins Dachsous and Fat, in planar cell polarity.
