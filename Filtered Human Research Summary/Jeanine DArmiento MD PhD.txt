                Dr. D’Armiento’s research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of lung injury and repair. Her laboratory integrates both in vitro and in vivo approaches and is uniquely situated to characterize the molecular changes in the study of lung injury and disease so as to identify potential therapeutic targets. Dr. D’Armiento’s clinical work focuses on Rare Disease, and she is the Director of the Center for LAM and Rare Lung Diseases at Columbia University, which serves one of the largest populations of women with LAM in addition to patients with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency.
