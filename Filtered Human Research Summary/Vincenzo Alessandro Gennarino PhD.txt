Neuroscience made enormous strides during the 1990’s with the advent of molecular genetic techniques that allowed us to identify myriad disease genes and manipulate them in animal models from flies to mice. In the 2000’s, we came to appreciate the importance of epigenetic mechanisms to neurobiology, and now we are on the cusp of a new field that might be called “RNA neurobiology.” RNA biology may, in fact, have particular importance in the brain, given the extremely dynamic nature of neuronal synapses. The post-synaptic compartment contains polysomes, which indicates that translation is crucial for higher-order brain activity, and protein synthesis has long been thought to be required for memory consolidation. Small wonder, then, that disruption of RNA-binding proteins is associated with wide-ranging syndromes that affect motor control, behavior, and cognition. My interest in RNA-binding proteins centers on their role in post-transcriptional regulation of proteins that, when mutated, lead to human neurological disease. But my interest is in the wild-type versions of these proteins: my research has shown that relatively modest increases or decreases in the levels of at least some ‘normal’ proteins can be pathogenic. This opens up an entirely new avenue to discovering new neurological disease genes, as I showed recently in the identification of patients bearing mutations in Pumilio1 (Cell, 2018).
