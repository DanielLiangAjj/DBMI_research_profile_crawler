The lab develops collaborative bioinformatics software to support the analysis and visualization of genomic data from a wide range of domains (gene expression, sequence, protein structure, and systems biology). This software leverages standards-based middleware technologies to provide seamless access to remote data, annotation, and computational servers, enabling researchers with limited local resources to benefit from public infrastructure. The lab is also leading the development of web infrastructure and knowledge representation frameworks for the standardization and dissemination of research findings reported in the literature. By consistently deploying scientific ontologies and reducing representational heterogeneity, these efforts make published research more accessible to human users and provide information codified in a manner amenable to machine learning. Additionally, the lab is developing innovative, systems biology-driven methodologies that offer improved power to detect the contribution of low-risk genetic factors to drug-induced serious adverse events (SAEs). In collaboration with an international network of investigators, the lab has led the analysis of genome-wide genotyping and exome sequencing data for drug-induced disorders including serious skin rash, liver injury, cardiac arrhythmias, and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Finally, the lab has developed motif discovery algorithms that have been used to study the underlying evolutionary architecture of genomic sequences.
