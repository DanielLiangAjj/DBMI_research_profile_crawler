The Sims Lab focuses on the development of new technology for the application of systems biology in biomedicine. We recently developed and applied new experimental and computational methods for cell type-specific, genome-wide analysis of transcription and translation in complex tissues such as the brain. In addition, we have developed new technology for large-scale expression analysis of individual cells by combining cutting-edge microscopy, next-generation sequencing, and microfabrication. We apply these tools in several human disease contexts including brain tumors and other neurological disorders.
