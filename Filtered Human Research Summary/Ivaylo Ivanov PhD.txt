A vast and diverse community of microorganisms lives in a symbiotic relationship within the human body. These resident microorganisms, mostly composed of bacteria, are also known as the commensal microbiota. Commensal bacteria are indispensable for the proper metabolic and immune functions of the host. It has recently become obvious that commensal bacteria are important modulators of intestinal immune homeostasis and that the composition of the microbiota is a major determining factor of the type and robustness of mucosal immune responses.
