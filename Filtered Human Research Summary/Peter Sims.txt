The Sims laboratory develops experimental and computational tools for genomic analysis with applications in cancer biology, immunology, and neuroscience. Researchers in his lab apply these tools in many areas of biomedical research from the identification of cell type-specific drug responses in malignant brain tumors to the understanding tissue adaptation and function across immune cell lineages.
