The Korem Lab conducts research aimed at facilitating the downstream development of microbiome-based therapeutics. They use machine learning, network inference, and metabolic modeling to obtain a mechanistic understanding of host-microbiome interactions in clinically relevant settings. While the recognition of the microbiomeâ€™s importance in human health and disease is constantly growing, and multiple aberrant microbial states have been characterized, they remain poorly understood. In most cases, we still do not know what drives, sustains, or modulates these states - let alone how to reverse them. Working at the intersection between computational biology and medicine, the Korem Lab both develops algorithms and computational methods that aim to understand microbial growth, activity, and metabolic production, as well as apply these methodologies as the basis for clinical inquiries in diverse settings, with a special focus on reproductive sciences.
