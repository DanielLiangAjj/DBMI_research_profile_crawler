His research aims to define genetic factors contributing to the risk of kidney disease. Dr. Kiryluk leads several large collaborative national and international genetic studies of glomerular disorders, such as IgA nephropathy, IgA vasculitis, and membranous nephropathy. Some of Dr. Kiryluk’s interests fall at the interface of research and clinical care. For example, he is leading precision medicine studies involving integrated genomic risk assessment with return of genetic results to patients and clinicians. He is also working on the development of new informatics methods to harness the power of “big data” (clinical and molecular) to enhance genetic discovery and improve clinical care of kidney patients.
