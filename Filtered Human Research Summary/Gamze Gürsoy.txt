                Dr. Gürsoy’s lab’s overarching research goal is to harmonize diverse fields such as biology, bioinformatics, molecular biology, engineering, and cryptography to achieve two fundamental aims: (1) to increase biomedical data access to a wider group of scientists while preserving privacy of research participants; and (2) to uncover the molecular underpinnings of gene dysregulation via knowledge gained from functional genomics data. They create modular and privacy-enhancing omics and clinical data analysis tools, which can be adapted to new data modalities and analysis needs as they arise, by combining knowledge in molecular biology and applied cryptography. They also develop computational and biochemical technologies to pinpoint genetic and epigenetic determinants of chromatin organization. Dr. Gürsoy leads a group of computational and experimental scientists, creating opportunities for training in cross-disciplinary studies in her lab.
