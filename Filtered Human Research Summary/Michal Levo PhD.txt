Coordinated activation of subsets of genes, at specific tissues and developmental times, governs cell fate decisions and cellular behavior. We now know that genomes are replete with regulatory sequences guiding this spatiotemporal activation of genes. Developmental disorders and diseases are often associated with disruptions to this regulatory code. As our mapping of eukaryotic genomes improved in the last few decades, we learned that the number of regulatory DNA elements greatly exceeds the number of genes, and these elements can reside far away along the genome from their target gene. What are the mechanisms that mediate gene regulation within this genomic labyrinth remains an open question. How do regulatory elements communicate with their target genes? What ensures the right regulatory interactions take place at specific cells and times? What are the molecular agents bringing the regulatory instruction to life? And how are properties of the local chromatin environment and the broader 3D genome organization related to the regulation of gene activity? The Levo lab combines several experimental modalities (from genomic assays to live subcellular imaging), with computational analysis and modeling, to study the dynamic, multilayered control of gene expression in the service of differentiation and development. Studies focus on perturbation-based approaches and quantitative measurements to facilitate causal insights and inform predictive models.
