The laboratory has been engaged in HIV research since the beginning of the AIDS pandemic, initially focusing on clinical virology and select topics in HIV pathogenesis. In the mid 1990s, the laboratory conducted a series of human studies to elucidate the dynamics of HIV replication in vivo. These studies formed the foundation for a pioneering effort to treat HIV “early and hard” and demonstrated for the first time the durable control of HIV replication in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. This was the turning point in the AIDS pandemic, transforming an automatic death sentence into a manageable disease.
