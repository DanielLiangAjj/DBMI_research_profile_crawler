                Dr. Califano is an internationally recognized pioneer in the reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks and in their analysis to systematically and efficiently identify key tumor checkpoint modules, whose aberrant activity is necessary for tumor viability. This has resulted in several clinical trials, including a very innovative N-of-1 study where patients affected by 14 untreatable, lethal cancers are analyzed on an individual basis to prioritize optimal therapeutic strategies, including both single drugs and drug combinations.
