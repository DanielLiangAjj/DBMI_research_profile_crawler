Biological investigations into Plasmodium falciparum, the etiologic agent of severe malaria, reveal an organism that is tremendously adept at overcoming therapeutic attack and evading host immunity. This haploid apicomplexan parasite causes disease in over half a billion individuals and kills over a million African children yearly, and prevents sterilizing immunity from being acquired even by individuals who have been infected thousands of times. Disease can result from severe anemia, hyperparasitemia, or other complications resulting from sequestration of parasitized red blood cells (RBC) in the microvasculature, a process that depends on the presentation of antigenically distinct parasite proteins on the infected RBC surface. Chemotherapeutic clearance of asexual blood stage parasites is the linchpin of malaria treatment and control, however it is systematically thwarted by the acquisition of resistance. The most dramatic consequence has been with chloroquine (CQ), for decades the gold standard until resistance appeared and pre-empted a dramatic increase in malaria mortality and morbidity rates, particularly in Africa. My laboratory's ongoing and planned research channels these interests into several themes: 1) What are the parasite factors that mediate resistance to antimalarial drugs; 2) What biological processes are targeted by antimalarial drugs and what accounts for parasite death; 3) What biochemical and physiological functions are intrinsic to the digestive vacuole (DV) and the apicoplast, the site of action of CQ and of antibiotics respectively; and 4) How does P. falciparum regulate its virulence and prevent the establishment of protective immunity. These studies benefit from our extensive experience in P. falciparum transfection and we constantly strive for new innovations in genetics to enhance the power of these investigations.
