His research focuses on the analysis of high-throughput biological data, the mathematical modeling of biological processes, and the use of nanotechnology for biomedical applications in diagnostics. Dr. Stolovitzky co-founded and leads the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM). Started in 2006 and supported through a partnership with Sage Bionetworks, DREAM is an international, collaborative effort that organizes challenges to identify the most effective methods in systems biology and leverage the expertise of the scientific community to address key problems in translational medicine.
