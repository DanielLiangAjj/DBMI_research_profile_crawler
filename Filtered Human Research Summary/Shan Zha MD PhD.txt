The diversity and specificity of the adaptive immune system is achieved through somatic assembly and subsequent modification of antigen receptor genes in developing lymphocytes. Specifically, functional immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes are assembled from germline variable, diversity and joining gene fragments through V(D)J recombination. In peripheral lymphoid organs, the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene is further modified through class switch recombination to achieve different effector functions. While V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination are initiated by a lymphocyte-specific cleavage mechanism, the repair of DNA double-strand break intermediates is mediated by the ubiquitously expressed non-homologous end-joining pathway. Moreover, like other DNA damage events, physiological DNA breaks activate DNA damage responses to enforce cell cycle arrest and achieve efficient and precise repair. Not surprisingly, defects in the DNA repair pathways can block lymphocyte development, leading to congenital primary immunodeficiency. Reducing the fidelity of DNA repair increases the risk of chromosomal translocations that can cause leukemia and lymphoma. The clinical treatment of human lymphomas and leukemias often induces additional DNA damage, which needs to be repaired by the non-homologous end-joining pathway with the help of DNA damage response factors. Therefore, elucidating the cellular pathways that mediate DNA repair, understanding their molecular mechanisms of action, and evaluating their in vivo functions in animal models will yield critical information for the clinical management of both immunodeficiencies and lymphoid malignancies.
