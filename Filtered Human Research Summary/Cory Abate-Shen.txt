                She is investigating the molecular mechanisms of homeobox genes in development and cancer. Her laboratory has provided groundbreaking insights on the molecular bases of how homeoproteins achieve target gene recognition in vivo. She has also developed mouse models of prostate cancer that have been widely used to investigate the molecular bases of prostate tumorigenesis and as preclinical models for intervention and therapy. She is the principal investigator on five federal grants including an NCI consortium grant on Mouse Models of Human Cancer.
