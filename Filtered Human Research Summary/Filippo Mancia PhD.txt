We are interested in the structure and function of membrane proteins. Proteins that reside within the plasma membrane are responsible for how a cell detects and responds to extra-cellular stimuli, of biological, chemical and physical nature. High-resolution snapshots of such molecules offer invaluable insights. 

Dr. Mancia’s main research focus is on membrane protein – lipid interactions. Within this realm, his lab has recently determined the high-resolution structure of enzymes from three families, which process lipid substrates. (1) GtrB, a polyisoprenyl phosphate glycosyltransferase attaches glucose to a lipid carrier for membrane translocation and a glycosyl donor for subsequent reactions. This reaction represents the first step in all protein glycosylation and glycosylation of the cell wall. (2) ArnT uses sugar-charged donors produced by GtrB-like enzymes, and transfers the saccharide to lipid A on the cell surface of bacteria, altering antibiotic resistance properties. (3) The Mancia lab determined the structure of a phosphatidylinositol-phosphate (PIP) synthase – an enzyme required for inositol-lipid synthesis – with a bound CDP-diacylglycerol substrate. This enzyme is a member of the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase family (CDP-APs), which catalyze the defining step in glycerophospholipid biosynthesis across all kingdoms of life. Retinoids (Vitamin A derivatives) are also lipids, and thus in this theme fits another project of the lab, aimed at understanding how STRA6-mediated cellular uptake of retinol occurs – fits into this research theme. The Mancia lab’s experience in structural biology, in overexpression of integral membrane proteins, in functional analyses of membrane proteins and in high-throughput techniques for membrane protein purification and selection, make it a unique environment for researchers interested in studying membrane protein-lipid substrate interactions, and in developing tools to advance this rapidly evolving field.
