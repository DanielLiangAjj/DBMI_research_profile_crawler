                Her work focuses on increasing representation of minorities in genetic and genomic research. Working collaboratively with communities-at-risk, her current research project explores three questions about the representation of minorities in genomic research: (1) How diverse are the enrollments in biobanks nationally? (2) What are the individual, cultural and systemic barriers and enablers to recruitment and enrollment? (3) What tools and interventions can be developed, tested and implemented to improve representation? The underlying goal is to assure that the findings of genomic research contribute maximally to health equity.
