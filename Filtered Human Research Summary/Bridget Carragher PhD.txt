For almost my entire career I have been involved in the development of streamlined and automated methods for EM aimed at improving both the quality of EM data as well as the accessibility of these techniques to the wider biological community. Over the past 16 years my colleague, Clinton S. Potter, and I have built the National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy (NRAMM) up from scratch into an internationally respected Resource that is acknowledged to lead the way in the development and application of automated technologies for EM and in providing training at all levels. NRAMM has contributed to over 280 papers since it began. Contributions to teaching and training activities have included individual student and post-doctoral supervision and mentoring, and the organization of many workshops and courses. Of note is the large biennial NRAMM training workshop that has earned an outstanding international reputation.
