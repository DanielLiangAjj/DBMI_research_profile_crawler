Her research has focused on characterizing the earliest motor and non-motor signs associated with genetic forms of PD. She is the founding (1991) and current director of the multidisciplinary Huntington's Disease Society of America Center of Excellence at Columbia which serves over 250 families receiving clinical care and participating in clinical trials and observational studies.
