Our overall goal is to understand how changes in molecular networks in the brain modify neural circuits to allow the generation of novel actions and their shaping by experience. We use genetic, electrophysiological, optical, and behavioral approaches to gain this mechanistic insight. We are also interested in understanding action control, in particular the differences between goal-directed actions and habits. We also study the mechanisms behind disorders of behavioral repetitive and compulsion, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders and Obsessive-Compulsive conditions.
