Higher-level organisms have evolved multi-layered immune systems, including physical barriers of skin and mucous membranes and soluble effector and cellular effector components to prevent pathologic colonization. Within these systems, adaptive T lymphocytes have for many years been considered the essential component of host cell-mediated immunity, using antigen-binding receptors to detect a wide array of ligands. In the past decade, another set of lymphocytes, namely innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), has been recognized to play critical roles in immunity against infections, especially during the early time window prior to T cell activation. ILCs lack antigen-specific receptors but resemble the effector phenotype and function of polarized T cell subsets in cytokine-induced cytokine production. ILCs are enriched in mucosal barriers but are also found in secondary lymphoid or non-lymphoid tissues, contributing to host defense, tissue repair, metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, and autoimmune disorders.
