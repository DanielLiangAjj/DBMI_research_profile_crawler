We combine behavioral, cellular, and molecular biological approaches to delineate the changes that underlie simple forms of learning and memory in invertebrates and vertebrates. In invertebrates, the focus of our research is on the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia. We study three elementary forms of learning: habituation, sensitization, and classical conditioning. Recently we have reconstituted critical components of this learning in dissociated cell culture, and we now use the reconstituted system to examine the molecular mechanisms, which contribute to short-and long-term memory. In vertebrates, we use genetically modified mice to examine the mechanisms of long-term potentiation in the mammalian hippocampus and its relation to spatial memory and maintenance.
