The general goal of this laboratory is to elucidate the pathogenesis of cancers derived from B lymphocytes, known as B cell lymphomas. These tumors originate from the malignant transformation of germinal center B cells, via acquisition of genomic lesions involving oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. We wish to identify these lesions, determine the mechanism by which they occur and elucidate the contribution of each lesion to tumor development using genetically modified mouse models. These studies are also aimed at identifying targets for therapeutic intervention. Specific lines of investigation include:
