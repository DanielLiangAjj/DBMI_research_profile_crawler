Our laboratory studies the regulation of transcription termination in E. coli and its bacteriophage. We are particularly interested in how transcription termination relates to translation and to DNA replication and chromosome integrity. We study how transcription and translation are coupled in E. coli, and the role of the NusG/Spt5 protein in linking RNAP to the lead ribosome. Another area of research concerns the mechanism of DNA double-strand break repair in Xenopus oocyte extracts and in mammalian cells.
