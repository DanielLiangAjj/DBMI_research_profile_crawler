Over the past two decades the most important revolution in human brain research took place due to the availability of non-invasive imaging methods allowing to evaluate the structure and function of the brain. Structural imaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows us to assess structural changes that occur as the brain develops when we are young and deteriorate as we age. When disease processes attack the brain, atrophy or other structural changes occur at a rapid rate. MRI allows us to precisely assess these changes. Further, it is now possible to measure the activity of brain cells using functional MRI (fMRI). Brain cells compute and communicate using electrical signals. This activity requires oxygen, the brain’s energy source, and the intricate and precise supply of oxygen to the brain can be measured with fMRI, providing us a map of brain activity. In the lab we seek to understand the relation between the brain’s structure and function in health and disease, with focus on the biology of learning and memory. We aspire to understand how brain structure and activity give rise to various aspects of behavior. To that end, we use fMRI in humans and mice to understand the basic principles of brain function as well as detect brain regions that are not working normally, follow them carefully and try novel first-in-class therapeutic approaches to alleviate brain disorders. We measure activity in multiple brain systems simultaneously, looking at the interactions between regions of the brain. We attempt to characterize changes in activity that can be used to identify populations or individuals at risk. Namely, we look for changes that precede and predict diseases. In doing so we open a time window for prevention and/or early therapeutic intervention programs that may benefit people that seem to be on a trajectory to develop a brain disorder.
