                His research aims to develop advanced genomics tools that decipher the complex genetic underpinnings of diseases. He uses these tools in collaboration with researchers working to understand and treat a broad range of human diseases, driving medical discovery and the translation of genetic insights into therapeutic solutions. He builds platforms for CRISPR knockout, interference, base editing, CRISPRoff, and Perturb-seq. He also uses high-throughput in situ spatial profiling to map RNA expression within individual cells in their native spatial context within a tissue. In addition to his publications on signaling biology, functional genomics, and cancer systems biology, he has been an instructor for Columbiaâ€™s Single-Cell Analysis Bootcamp. He has been involved in developing or implementing diverse functional genomics methods, including creating tools that have been used by over 240 labs spanning 35 countries.
