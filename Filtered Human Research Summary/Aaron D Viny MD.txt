Normal gene expression is controlled, in part, through multiple regulatory systems which coordinate transcription. This includes transcription factors that recruit enzymes to express genes as well as an evolving understanding of the 3-dimensional chromatin architecture which brings together either DNA enhancer regions to activate genes or DNA insulation regions to silence genes. Structural scaffold proteins such as CTCF and the cohesin complex are essential in maintaining the integrity of local DNA structural interactions within defined neighborhoods known as topologically associating domains (TADs). These proteins provide dynamic structure within the TAD which is essential in influencing dynamic cell-type specific transcriptional programs. Genes which contribute to transcriptional regulation, including members of the cohesin complex, are frequently mutated in human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (12-20%), glioblastoma multiforme (5%), bladder cancer (20-35%) and Ewing sarcoma (40-50%). The functional consequences of chromatin structure in regulating lineage-specification, signal-dependent responses, and local/distant DNA structure has not been fully elucidated, however, our recent work has established the requirement of suitable chromatin architecture for the function of cell-type specific transcription factors to activate genes responsible for blood formation and bone marrow stem cell differentiation. Our laboratory uses genetic mouse models and primary patient samples to understand the role of altered chromatin architecture as a regulator of gene expression/gene silencing that maintain the balance of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal with differentiation and blood formation.
