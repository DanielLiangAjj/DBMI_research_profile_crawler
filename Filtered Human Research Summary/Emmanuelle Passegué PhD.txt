Our laboratory studies how hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) regulate blood production during the lifetime of an ever-changing organism. This fundamental question is central to tissue development, maintenance and regeneration, and has implications for every aspect of adult physiology ranging from response to stress, development of diseases, and biology of aging. We are interested in identifying the mechanisms that control HSC activity in normal and a range of deregulated conditions, with the goal of identifying affected genes and pathways that could be used to develop new therapies to treat human myeloid malignancies and help combat physiological aging. Towards this end, we are employing a variety of cross-disciplinary approaches using mouse models and human samples.
