Our lab is interested in understanding how viruses manipulate gene expression in infected cells. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely on the cellular gene expression machinery for replication; consequently, the abilities of virus and host cell to control gene expression play critical roles during the establishment of viral infection. Many viruses have evolved elegant strategies to co-opt and manipulate cellular processes for their own benefit, but conversely, eukaryotic cells use specialized branches of gene expression pathways to respond to and eradicate viruses. In the Steckelberg lab, we combine biochemical, structural (x-ray crystallography and cryoEM) and cell biological methods to study the molecular interactions that regulate gene expression during infection with RNA viruses of the flaviviridae and coronaviridae families. Studying how viruses hijack cellular processes provides insight into the life cycle of important human pathogens but also expands our understanding of the cellular machinery itself. By studying RNA-protein interactions at the host-virus interface we thus strive to deconstruct molecular networks that regulate gene expression in human cells.
