Decades of research in innate immunity has unraveled how the host uses pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect microbial DNA and RNA to mount an immune response that counteracts infection. However, these findings raise an intriguing question: How does the host suppress immune responses to their own DNA or RNA? This is a fundamental question in biology and a topic of high clinical relevance as we start to recognize how self-nucleic acid sensing by our immune system can cause autoimmune diseases, and also be used for immunomodulatory therapies for diseases such as cancer.
