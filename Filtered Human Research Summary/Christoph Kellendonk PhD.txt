The Kellendonk laboratory uses circuit dissection tools in the mouse to understand the biology that underlies cognitive, negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. To this end, we have been manipulating the expression levels of dopamine D2 receptors and neuronal activity in genetically defined sub-circuits of the striatum and studied the consequences of these manipulations on behavior and circuit function. Using similar approaches, we have been studying the role of thalamo-prefrontal circuits in cognition and working memory. Recently, we began to address the role of dopamine in the generation of false percepts which has relevance to auditory hallucinations in humans.
