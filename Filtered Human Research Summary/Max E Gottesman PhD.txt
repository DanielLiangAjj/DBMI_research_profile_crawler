My laboratory investigates the mechanism of transcription termination in E. coli and how termination affects other cellular processes. Blocking the release of a stalled transcription elongation complex leads to clashes with the replisome and the formation of lethal DNA double-strand breaks. Coupling of transcription to translation suppresses stalling. NusG links RNA polymerase and the first translating ribosome. The linkage is broken by tmRNA, which releases ribosomes at rare codons. The interactions among ribosomes, RNA polymerase and DNA polymerase are being investigated using genetic and biochemical approaches. In addition, the laboratory is probing the structure of the ribosome-NusG-RNA polymerase complex. Phage HK022 Nun protein has been an active area of research. We have just begun to understand how Nun interacts with E. coli RNAP to arrest transcription. Nun, however, is full of surprises, and continues to amaze. We also have a long-standing interest in repair of DNA damage. We have now established an E. coli based system that monitors transcription-coupled repair of inter-strand crosslinks (ICLs).
