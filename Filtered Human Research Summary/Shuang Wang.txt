Dr. Shuang Wang's research interest is in the broad area of statistical genetics with an emphasis on genetic linkage and association studies and mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL). Within the two areas, Dr. Wang focuses on the development and application of statistical methods in detecting gene-gene interaction in genetic linkage analysis and linkage disequilibrium analysis using both family-based methods and population-based methods. Dr. Wang is also interested in quantitative trait mapping in out-bred populations, and inferring recombination rates at the population genetics level to identify genomic forces that contribute to this variation. Dr. Wang's other research involves DNA pooling strategy and genetic imprinting effect.
