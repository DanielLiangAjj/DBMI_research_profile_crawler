My research involves the mathematical modeling and analysis of neurons and neural networks. Analytic techniques and computer simulation are used to study how different conductances contribute to the electrical characteristics of a neuron, how neurons interact to produce functioning neural circuits, and how large populations of neurons represent, store, and process information.
